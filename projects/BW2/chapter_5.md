## Chapter 5: The Art of Approach

**Scene 1: Max orchestrates his first "ch...**

**Scene 1: Max orchestrates his first "chance" encounter with Mariana**

The hotel café occupied a sun-drenched corner of the conference venue's atrium, all brass fixtures and marble tabletops that caught the morning light streaming through floor-to-ceiling windows. Max had positioned himself at a corner table twenty minutes earlier, laptop open, financial reports scattered artfully across the surface—the picture of a venture capitalist catching up on work before the day's sessions began.

He'd watched Mariana Alvidrez enter through his peripheral vision, tracking her movement as she approached the counter. She wore a charcoal suit that managed to be both professional and devastating, her dark hair pulled back in a way that emphasized the sharp angles of her face. Even from across the café, he could see the intelligence in her eyes as she scanned the room—not casual observation, but tactical assessment.

Max waited until she'd collected her espresso before making his move. He stood, gathering his papers with deliberate clumsiness, and timed his path to the counter to intersect with hers.

The collision was gentle, choreographed. His folder slipped from his hands, reports fanning across the polished floor.

"Shit," he muttered, dropping to one knee.

"Let me help." Her accent carried traces of Russian beneath European polish, her voice lower than he'd expected. She crouched beside him, setting her espresso on a nearby table, and began gathering the scattered pages.

"No, please—I'm sorry, I wasn't watching where I was going." Max reached for the same report she did, their fingers nearly touching. He met her eyes and held them for a beat longer than necessary. "Thank you."

She glanced at the header on one of the documents before handing it to him. "Quantum computing investments in Southeast Asia. Ambitious portfolio."

Max straightened, papers now secured against his chest. "You know the sector?"

"I know enough to recognize when someone's chasing the next big thing." A slight smile played at the corner of her mouth. "Or trying to convince others to chase it with them."

He laughed, genuine surprise coloring the sound. Most people at these conferences couldn't distinguish quantum computing from quantum mechanics. "Max Monroe. And you've just summarized my entire pitch deck in one sentence."

"Mariana Alvidrez." She extended her hand. Her grip was firm, confident. "Strategic partnerships consultant."

"That covers a lot of territory."

"It does." She retrieved her espresso, taking a measured sip. "Which is why I find these conferences useful. Lots of territory to cover."

Max gestured toward his abandoned table. "I was just reviewing some market analyses. If you have a few minutes, I'd be curious to hear your perspective on the European tech landscape. I'm looking at expansion opportunities."

She considered him for a moment, and Max felt the weight of her assessment. Whatever conclusion she reached, it must have satisfied her, because she nodded. "I can spare fifteen minutes."

They settled at his table, Mariana choosing the seat that gave her a view of the café's entrance—another tactical choice that Max filed away. He reopened his laptop, pulling up a presentation he'd prepared specifically for this moment.

"I'm particularly interested in the Baltics," he began, watching her reaction. "Estonia's digital infrastructure, Lithuania's fintech sector. But the regulatory environment is—"

"Complex," she finished. "Especially for American investors who don't understand that Eastern Europe isn't a monolith." She leaned forward slightly, her focus sharpening. "Estonia is easy—they want to be the EU's digital testing ground. Lithuania is trickier. They're hungry for investment but protective of their domestic markets. And the real opportunities most VCs miss are in Poland and Romania."

Max pulled up a map, highlighting regions. "Romania surprises me. The corruption indices—"

"Are improving faster than most analysts acknowledge." Mariana's finger traced a path on his screen, from Bucharest northward. "The tech sector in Cluj-Napoca alone has grown forty percent in three years. Young talent, lower operational costs than Western Europe, and a government that's finally prioritizing digital infrastructure." She sat back. "But you'd need local partners. The kind who understand how things actually work, not just what the official channels tell you."

"Partners like the ones you connect people with?"

Her smile was knowing. "Exactly like that."

For the next ten minutes, they traded observations about emerging markets, blockchain applications, and the venture capital landscape. Max had done his homework, but Mariana matched him point for point, occasionally introducing angles he hadn't considered. She spoke about technology trends with the fluency of someone who'd spent years in the sector, yet her insights into geopolitical factors suggested a deeper, more complex background.

"You're well-informed for a partnerships consultant," Max said, keeping his tone light and admiring. "Most people in your role focus on the relationship side, not the technical details."

"Most people in my role are glorified networkers." She finished her espresso. "I prefer to understand what I'm actually facilitating. When you're connecting billion-dollar entities, ignorance isn't charming—it's expensive."

A waiter approached to refill Max's coffee. Mariana glanced at her watch—slim, elegant, probably worth more than most people's monthly salary.

"I should prepare for the morning panel," she said, but made no immediate move to leave. "What brings you to this particular conference, Mr. Monroe? Beyond the obvious networking opportunities?"

Max closed his laptop. "Due diligence. I'm considering a significant investment in a European AI firm, but I want to understand the ecosystem better first. Make sure I'm not walking into a sophisticated house of cards."

"Smart." She stood, smoothing her jacket. "The AI sector is full of them. Companies with impressive demos and no viable path to profitability."

"Speaking from experience?"

"Observation." She picked up her clutch. "I've watched several promising ventures collapse because investors fell in love with the technology without understanding the business model."

Max stood as well, extending his hand again. "Well, I appreciate the crash course in Eastern European tech investment. If you're free later, I'd love to continue the conversation. Maybe over dinner?"

She shook his hand, her grip as firm as before, but this time she held it a fraction longer. "Perhaps. I have commitments this evening, but I'll be at the reception tomorrow night. We can see if the conversation is still worth continuing."

"Fair enough."

She turned to leave, then paused. "One piece of advice, Mr. Monroe?"

"Please."

"If you're serious about Eastern European investments, be very careful who you trust. The region has a way of chewing up outsiders who think their American due diligence processes will protect them." Her expression was unreadable. "Local knowledge isn't just an advantage. It's survival."

Max watched her walk away, her heels clicking against the marble floor with military precision. She didn't look back.

He sat down slowly, pulling his laptop closer and opening a secure messaging app. His fingers moved quickly across the keys:

*First contact established. Subject is sharp—extremely well-versed in tech sector and geopolitical dynamics. Cover holding but will require careful maintenance. She's assessing me as much as I'm assessing her. Recommend deep background dive on her professional history, particularly any consulting work in AI or facial recognition sectors.*

He sent the message and closed the laptop, his coffee growing cold in front of him.

Fifteen minutes. In fifteen minutes, Mariana Alvidrez had demonstrated more technical knowledge than most consultants acquired in years, issued what could be interpreted as either friendly advice or a subtle warning, and left him with the distinct impression that she knew exactly what game they were both playing.

The question was whether she knew the stakes.

Max gathered his papers again, this time with genuine purpose, and headed toward the conference hall. The morning's keynote would start in twenty minutes, and according to the schedule, Mariana would be on the panel.

He wanted to see how she performed when she wasn't assessing potential threats over espresso.

**Scene 2: Max reports back to his handle...**

**Scene 2: Max reports back to his handler via encrypted communication**

The hotel room was dark except for the blue glow of Max's laptop screen. He'd positioned himself at the desk facing the door, back to the window—standard protocol, though the fourteenth floor made physical intrusion unlikely. Outside, Geneva's lights sparkled across the lake like scattered diamonds, but Max kept his attention on the encrypted video feed loading on his screen.

The connection established with a soft chime. The video window remained black—his handler never appeared on camera—but the audio came through clear, filtered through voice modulation that made it sound like gravel sliding down a metal chute.

"Status report."

Max adjusted the wireless earpiece, ensuring the room's white noise generator was active. The device sat on the nightstand, emitting a barely audible hum that would scramble any listening devices.

"Two encounters engineered successfully. Target is responsive but cautious. She's sharp—knows tech sector inside and out. My cover as a fintech investor is holding, but she's asking questions that suggest she's vetting me as thoroughly as I'm vetting her."

"Expected. What about the background check?"

Max pulled up the file on his secondary tablet, though he'd already memorized every line. "That's the problem. It's too clean. Mariana Volkov, born in Grozny, relocated to Berlin in 2012, moved to Zurich in 2016. Education checks out—economics degree from Humboldt University. Employment history shows consulting work for various firms, all legitimate. No criminal record, no red flags, no gaps."

"And the issue is?"

"The issue is nobody's background is this pristine. No youthful indiscretions, no financial hiccups, no questionable associations. For someone who grew up in Chechnya during the conflicts, there should be *something*. Trauma, displacement records, refugee documentation. Instead, her past reads like a carefully curated résumé."

The handler was silent for a moment. Max could hear the faint sound of typing through the connection.

"We've confirmed her employment with Vershinsky's network," the voice said finally. "She's listed as a senior consultant for strategic partnerships across three of his shell companies. Salary puts her in the seven-figure range. Travel records show extensive movement—Dubai, Singapore, San Francisco, London. Always first-class, always high-end accommodations."

Max stood and moved to the window, keeping his voice low despite the noise generator. "So she's well-compensated. The question is: for what exactly?"

"That's what you're there to determine."

"There's something else." Max watched a boat move across the dark water below, its running lights cutting a path through the reflection of the city. "Tonight at the reception, I observed her with Gerald Hartman—CEO of VeriTech Systems. They do facial recognition software, primarily for law enforcement and border security."

"We're aware of VeriTech. Go on."

"The interaction lasted maybe three minutes. Casual conversation, wine in hand, the usual networking theater. But I've been watching her for two days now, and I saw something different. The way she focused on him—it was predatory. Calculated. Like a snake deciding whether to strike."

Max paused, replaying the memory. Mariana's hand on Hartman's arm, her lips close to his ear as she spoke over the ambient music. The CEO's pupils dilating, his posture shifting from confident to subtly off-balance.

"When Hartman excused himself, he looked disoriented. Flushed. I followed him to a private lounge and found him alone, touching his lips like they were burning. He claimed it was an allergic reaction, but I've seen enough field work to know what a contact toxin looks like."

The typing sounds intensified. "Did you get close enough to assess?"

"Not without compromising my cover. He waved me off, seemed embarrassed. But his hands were shaking, and he kept pressing his fingers to his mouth. Whatever happened during that conversation, it wasn't just small talk."

"We'll run Hartman's name through the database, cross-reference with any recent unusual activity. VeriTech has government contracts that would make their technology valuable to Vershinsky's interests."

Max returned to the desk, his reflection ghostly in the darkened laptop screen. "If Mariana's using some kind of contact agent, we're dealing with a more sophisticated operation than standard corporate espionage. This is intelligence-level tradecraft."

"Which is why we need you closer. The directive is to accelerate the approach while maintaining operational security. We need to know what she's really doing for Vershinsky, and we need to know it before whatever she's planning reaches critical mass."

"Accelerate how? She's already suspicious of anyone who shows too much interest too quickly."

"Then don't show interest in her work. Show interest in *her*. You've established the foundation. Now build on it. Make yourself valuable enough that she brings you in voluntarily."

Max felt the familiar weight of the assignment settling deeper into his shoulders. Getting close to a target was one thing. Getting close to someone who might be using chemical weapons in social settings was another entirely.

"Understood. What's my timeline?"

"The conference ends in four days. If you can't establish a deeper connection by then, we'll need to reassess the entire operation. Vershinsky's network is expanding too rapidly to wait for a perfect opening."

"Four days." Max closed the laptop, ending the connection. The room fell into darkness, broken only by the ambient light from the window.

He sat motionless for a moment, listening to the white noise generator's steady hum. Somewhere in this city, Mariana Volkov was probably in her own hotel room, perhaps reporting to her own handlers, perhaps planning her next move against whatever target Vershinsky had designated.

Max stood and moved to his go-bag, pulling out a small case containing his field equipment. Among the items was a portable spectrometer, small enough to fit in a jacket pocket. If he was going to get closer to Mariana, he needed to be prepared for whatever tools she might be using.

He thought of Hartman's burning lips, the disorientation, the trembling hands. 

Four days to get close to a woman who might kiss like poison.

Max returned the equipment to the bag and checked his phone. Tomorrow's schedule showed another networking breakfast, followed by an afternoon panel on emerging markets. Mariana would be at both.

Time to engineer encounter number three.

**Scene 3: Max engineers a second encount...**

**Scene 3: Max engineers a second encounter with Mariana at a panel discussion**

The conference hall smelled of coffee and ambition—a potent combination that Max had learned to associate with these tech gatherings. Rows of seats filled with venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and the occasional industrial spy stretched before a raised platform where four experts prepared to discuss the future of cybersecurity.

Max had studied the panel lineup that morning. Mariana would be here. She'd mentioned it yesterday during their brief conversation about blockchain vulnerabilities, dropping the information like a breadcrumb. Whether intentional or not, he'd followed.

He spotted her near the center aisle, settling into a seat with the practiced efficiency of someone who attended too many of these events. Her charcoal blazer caught the overhead lights as she crossed her legs, already scrolling through her phone with one hand while holding a paper program in the other.

Max waited. Timing mattered in this dance.

The moderator took the stage, welcoming the audience with the forced enthusiasm of someone contractually obligated to care. Max moved then, navigating the aisle with his own coffee in hand, eyes ostensibly scanning for an empty seat.

"Is this taken?" He gestured to the chair beside Mariana.

She glanced up, and for a microsecond, something flickered across her face—recognition, calculation, then a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes.

"Max, isn't it? From the networking session?"

"Good memory." He sat, noting how she angled slightly toward him, a subtle shift in body language that invited conversation while maintaining professional distance. "I didn't peg you for the cybersecurity crowd."

"I find it pays to understand the threats we're trying to prevent." Her accent wrapped around the words like silk over steel. "And you?"

"Occupational hazard. My investors want to know where the next breach will come from."

The panel began with the predictable opening statements—buzzwords about zero-trust architecture and quantum encryption stacked like building blocks of jargon. Max settled back, letting the technical wash over him while maintaining peripheral awareness of Mariana.

Fifteen minutes in, one of the panelists—a professor from MIT with wild gray hair—launched into a passionate diatribe about backdoors in commercial encryption.

"This is where it gets interesting," Mariana whispered, leaning closer. Her perfume carried notes of jasmine and something darker, more complex. "Watch the woman on the left. She works for a company that builds exactly what he's criticizing."

Max followed her gaze to a severe-looking blonde who'd gone rigid in her seat. "You know her?"

"I know everyone." It wasn't a boast, just a statement of fact. "Part of my job."

The blonde panelist jumped in, her voice sharp with defensive precision. The professor countered. The moderator tried to regain control. The audience leaned forward, energized by conflict.

"Twenty euros says she mentions national security within thirty seconds," Mariana murmured.

"I'll take that bet."

Twenty-three seconds later, the phrase emerged. Max pulled out his phone, thumbing through a banking app with exaggerated ceremony.

Mariana's laugh was low, genuine. "I'll collect later. With interest."

They fell into a rhythm after that—whispered observations, shared glances when a panelist contradicted themselves, the occasional sardonic comment delivered behind raised coffee cups. To anyone watching, they were simply two professionals enjoying a mutual appreciation for the absurdity of corporate theater.

But Max felt the weight of performance in every word. She was good—better than good. Each revelation seemed spontaneous while being carefully measured. Each joke felt natural while serving to deflect deeper inquiry.

When the panel ended and the crowd began to disperse, Mariana stood, stretching with feline grace.

"I need a real drink," she said. "These events make my brain hurt."

"The lounge bar?"

"You read my mind."

The adjacent lounge occupied a corner of the hotel with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Geneva's old town. Afternoon light slanted through the glass, painting everything in shades of amber and gold. The space was designed for exactly this purpose—informal networking lubricated by expensive alcohol and the illusion of privacy.

They claimed a table near the windows. A server materialized, and Mariana ordered a Negroni without consulting the menu. Max opted for single malt, neat.

"So," he said once their drinks arrived, "you mentioned you've been in Europe for a while. Where did you start?"

"Chechnya, originally." She said it matter-of-factly, swirling her drink. "But that feels like another lifetime."

"Long way from Geneva."

"That's rather the point." Her eyes tracked something outside the window—a bird, perhaps, or just a convenient focal point for manufactured nostalgia. "I left during the second war. Sixteen years old with a backpack and false papers."

The story emerged in carefully constructed fragments. A scholarship to a university in Prague. Early work in translation services. A talent for connecting people that evolved into consulting. Each detail was plausible, supported by the kind of specificity that suggested truth while revealing nothing of substance.

Max listened, nodding at appropriate moments, asking questions that seemed curious rather than interrogative. He'd read her background check—the one that had come back suspiciously pristine. No gaps, no contradictions, no messy human complications. The woman across from him was either exactly who she claimed to be, or she'd had professional help constructing her legend.

"And now you work with Vershinsky," he said, keeping his tone casual.

"Among others. I specialize in strategic partnerships—bringing together people who can benefit from knowing each other." She met his eyes over the rim of her glass. "Like us, for instance."

"Are we benefiting from knowing each other?"

"Too early to tell." Her smile was calculated to intrigue. "But I'm optimistic."

A group of conference attendees claimed a nearby table, their voices rising with the confidence of second drinks. Mariana glanced at them, then back to Max.

"Tell me something," she said. "What made you approach me yesterday? And don't say my presentation. You barely looked at the slides."

Max allowed himself a slight smile. "You're right. It wasn't the slides."

"Then what?"

"You looked like someone who actually knew what they were talking about. Rare in these circles."

"Flattery?"

"Observation."

She studied him for a long moment, and Max felt the full weight of her attention. It was like being scanned, evaluated, processed. He maintained eye contact, letting her see confidence without arrogance, interest without desperation.

"You're good at this," she said finally.

"At what?"

"The game." She finished her Negroni, setting the glass down with precise care. "Most people try too hard. They want to impress, to dominate the conversation, to prove they're the smartest person in the room. You listen. You observe. You make people feel seen."

"Is that a compliment or a warning?"

"Can't it be both?"

The server returned, and Mariana ordered another round without asking if Max wanted one. He didn't object. The afternoon was sliding toward evening, the light outside shifting from gold to rose.

"I have a theory," Max said when the server left. "Want to hear it?"

"Always."

"You're testing me. Every conversation we've had, you're measuring responses, cataloging reactions. You're deciding whether I'm useful."

Mariana's expression didn't change, but something in her posture shifted—a fractional straightening of her spine, a slight narrowing of her eyes.

"And what would I find you useful for?"

"That's what I'm trying to figure out."

She laughed then, a genuine sound that seemed to surprise her as much as him. "You're either very perceptive or very paranoid."

"I've found the two aren't mutually exclusive."

Their second drinks arrived. Outside, the sun touched the roofline of the old town, setting the ancient stones ablaze. Inside, the lounge had filled with the evening crowd—deals being made, alliances being forged, futures being negotiated over craft cocktails and small plates.

"Chechnya," Max said, returning to safer ground. "Do you ever go back?"

"Never." The word was absolute. "There's nothing there for me now. The people I knew are dead or scattered. The places I remember don't exist anymore."

"No family?"

"None that matter." She turned the conversation with practiced ease. "What about you? Where does Max Monroe call home when he's not chasing investments across Europe?"

"San Francisco, officially. But I'm rarely there."

"No attachments?"

"A few. Nothing that can't be managed remotely."

**Scene 4: At an exclusive private recept...**

**Scene 4: At an exclusive private reception**

The Bellevue's Wintergarten suite had been transformed into an intimate sanctuary for those whose net worth exceeded small nations' GDP. Soft amber lighting from antique chandeliers cast a warm glow over the assembled elite, their conversations a low murmur beneath the string quartet's refined interpretation of Vivaldi. Max stood near the bar, a glass of Macallan in hand that he'd barely touched, his attention fixed on the woman across the room.

Mariana Alvidrez moved through the crowd like a shark through dark water—graceful, purposeful, and utterly focused. She wore a midnight blue dress that whispered against her skin with each calculated step, her dark hair swept back to reveal the elegant line of her neck. For the past twenty minutes, Max had watched her work the room, engaging in brief conversations with venture capitalists and tech moguls, her smile warm but never quite reaching her eyes.

Then something shifted.

Max felt it before he saw it—a subtle change in the air, like the moment before lightning strikes. Mariana had stopped mid-conversation with a Swiss banker, her head tilting slightly as her gaze locked onto someone across the room. The transformation was minute, nearly imperceptible, but Max had spent enough time in hostile territory to recognize a predator selecting prey.

He followed her line of sight to Gerald Hartman.

The CEO of Sentinel Vision stood near the floor-to-ceiling windows, gesturing animatedly to a small group of investors. Hartman was in his late forties, prematurely gray, with the soft edges of someone who'd spent more time in boardrooms than gyms. His company had made headlines six months ago when their facial recognition software had been adopted by three major European airports. Max had read the briefing on him during his research—divorced, two kids in college, a reputation for being brilliant but socially awkward.

Perfect target material.

Mariana excused herself from the banker with a touch on his arm that seemed almost apologetic. Then she began her approach, angling through the crowd with the patience of a hunter who knew her quarry wasn't going anywhere. She didn't rush. Instead, she positioned herself near the windows, examining a painting on the wall—a modernist piece that probably cost more than most people's homes—waiting for the precise moment.

Max drifted closer, keeping his movements casual, just another guest circulating through the reception. He positioned himself behind a marble pillar, close enough to observe but far enough to avoid drawing attention.

Hartman's group was breaking up, the investors moving toward the hors d'oeuvres table. The CEO remained at the window, checking his phone with the distracted air of someone eager to escape social obligations.

That's when Mariana made her move.

She approached from his peripheral vision, her heels clicking softly against the parquet floor. "Mr. Hartman?" Her accent carried just the right amount of European sophistication. "I hope I'm not interrupting."

Hartman looked up, startled, then his expression shifted to the cautious politeness of someone accustomed to networking pitches. "Not at all. I'm sorry, have we met?"

"Mariana Alvidrez." She extended her hand, and when Hartman took it, Max noticed how she held the contact a fraction longer than necessary. "I've been following Sentinel Vision's work with great interest. The integration with the Amsterdam airport was particularly impressive."

Flattery, Max thought. Classic opener.

But there was something else. Even from his position, he could see the way Mariana's pupils had dilated slightly, the way her breathing had become more measured. It reminded him of the moment before a sniper pulls the trigger—that absolute stillness that precedes violence.

"Thank you," Hartman said, warming to the topic. "Amsterdam was a challenge, but the results speak for themselves. We reduced security processing time by forty percent while increasing threat detection accuracy."

"Remarkable." Mariana stepped closer, her body language shifting subtly. She angled herself so that she was slightly below his eyeline, looking up at him with what appeared to be genuine fascination. "I'd love to hear more about your algorithm's approach to biometric mapping. The technical specifications I've read are impressive, but I imagine the real innovation is in the implementation."

Hartman's face lit up the way only a tech CEO's could when someone showed genuine interest in the minutiae of their work. "Actually, the breakthrough came when we stopped trying to map the entire face and focused on micro-expressions instead. You see, traditional facial recognition can be fooled by makeup, prosthetics, even significant weight changes, but the underlying muscular structure..."

As he spoke, Mariana leaned in, ostensibly to hear better over the string quartet. But Max saw her hand rise, fingers brushing against her own collarbone in a gesture that drew Hartman's eyes downward for just a moment. When his gaze returned to her face, something had changed in his expression—a slight glassiness, a flush creeping up his neck.

Max's jaw tightened. He was watching a master at work, and it made his skin crawl.

Mariana laughed at something Hartman said, a low, intimate sound that seemed to create a bubble around them, isolating them from the rest of the room. She touched his arm lightly, her fingertips resting just above his wrist. "You know, I'm consulting with several firms that could benefit from exactly this kind of technology. Perhaps we could discuss it over coffee tomorrow? I'm staying at the Bellevue as well."

"I'd like that." Hartman's voice had taken on a slightly breathless quality. His free hand rose to loosen his collar, though the room wasn't particularly warm.

"Perfect." Mariana's smile widened, revealing perfect white teeth. She leaned in closer, her lips near his ear, and whispered something Max couldn't hear.

Whatever she said made Hartman's eyes widen. He swayed slightly, steadying himself against the window frame.

Then Mariana pulled back, her expression shifting seamlessly to one of polite concern. "Are you alright, Mr. Hartman?"

"Yes, I..." He touched his lips with his fingertips, a confused expression crossing his face. "Just a bit warm suddenly."

"Perhaps you should get some air?" She gestured toward the balcony doors. "Or I could get you some water?"

"No, no, I'm fine." But he didn't look fine. A sheen of sweat had appeared on his forehead, and he was breathing more rapidly. "I should probably... excuse me."

Hartman moved past her, his gait slightly unsteady, heading toward the private lounges at the rear of the suite. Mariana watched him go, and for just a moment—a single, unguarded moment—Max saw her real face.

The warm smile had vanished. In its place was something cold and calculating, a satisfaction that bordered on predatory pleasure. Her eyes tracked Hartman's retreat with the focus of a cat watching a wounded bird struggle.

Then she turned, and the mask was back in place. She smoothed her dress, picked up a champagne flute from a passing waiter, and rejoined the circulation of guests as if nothing had happened.

Max waited thirty seconds before following Hartman's path. His pulse hammered in his throat, adrenaline sharpening his senses. Whatever he'd just witnessed, it was more than simple flirtation or corporate espionage. The way Hartman had reacted, the burning sensation he'd mentioned touching his lips—

The private lounge was tucked away behind a mahogany door marked "VIP." Max pushed through to find a smaller room decorated in deep burgundy and gold, with leather chairs arranged around low tables. Only a handful of people occupied the space, seeking refuge from the main reception's social demands.

Hartman sat alone in a corner chair, his head tilted back, eyes closed. His chest rose and fell in rapid, shallow breaths. One hand remained pressed against his mouth, the other gripping the chair's armrest with white-knuckled intensity.

Max crossed to him, keeping his voice low and concerned. "Sir? Are you alright?"

Hartman's eyes snapped open. For a moment, confusion clouded his features, as if he couldn't quite remember where he was. Then recognition settled in—not of Max specifically, but of the situation. "I'm fine. Just... just need a minute."

"You don't look fine." Max crouched beside the chair, close enough to see the dilated pupils, the slight tremor in Hartman's hands. "Should I call someone? A doctor?"

"No." The word came out sharper than intended. Hartman took a shuddering breath, forcing himself to sit up straighter. "No doctors. It's just... an allergic reaction, I think. Something I ate,

**Scene 5: Max watches Hartman excuse him...**

**Scene 5: Max watches Hartman excuse himself from Mariana**

The private lounge smelled of leather and old money—Chesterfield sofas arranged around a marble fireplace, amber lighting that cast everything in a sepia warmth. Max had slipped in thirty seconds after Gerald Hartman, maintaining enough distance to avoid suspicion but close enough to intervene if needed.

If he wasn't already too late.

Hartman sat alone in a wingback chair near the window, the city lights of Geneva spreading below him like scattered diamonds. His hand kept moving to his mouth, fingers pressing against his lips as if trying to smother invisible flames. Even from across the room, Max could see the sheen of sweat on the man's forehead.

Max approached with calculated casualness, whiskey glass in hand—the universal prop of concerned conference attendees everywhere. "You alright there?"

Hartman's head snapped up. His eyes were bloodshot, pupils slightly dilated. For a moment, he seemed to struggle to focus. "What? Yes. Fine."

"You don't look fine." Max gestured with his glass toward an empty chair. "Mind if I...?"

"Actually, I'd prefer—" Hartman's words cut off as he touched his lips again, this time with more urgency. His breathing had gone shallow.

Max's pulse hammered against his ribs. This was it. This was what he'd come to prevent, unfolding right in front of him, and he couldn't do a goddamn thing without exposing himself. He couldn't call for medical help without raising questions about why he'd followed Hartman. Couldn't confront Mariana without destroying months of preparation.

He sat anyway, leaning forward with the practiced concern of a stranger who'd had one too many drinks and felt compelled to help. "Listen, I saw you talking to that woman—Mariana something. Gorgeous, but..." He let the sentence trail off meaningfully.

Hartman's laugh came out brittle. "But what? You think she poisoned me?" He shook his head, then immediately seemed to regret the motion, closing his eyes. "Christ. I'm having an allergic reaction. Happens sometimes. Shellfish, probably. The canapés."

"Your lips are burning?"

"How did you—" Hartman's eyes narrowed. "Who are you?"

Max held up both hands, the whiskey sloshing dangerously close to the rim. "Nobody. Just a guy who's seen anaphylaxis before. My sister carries an EpiPen. You should get medical attention."

"It's not that serious." But Hartman's hand trembled as he reached for the water glass on the side table. He took a long drink, his throat working convulsively. When he lowered the glass, his expression had shifted—less defensive, more frightened. "It's just... burning. Like I kissed a hot stove."

The neurotoxin. Had to be. Max's mind raced through the intelligence briefings. Initial symptoms: burning sensation at point of contact, disorientation, elevated heart rate. Then what? How long before it became irreversible?

"Let me call someone." Max was already reaching for his phone.

"No." Hartman's voice cracked like a whip. "No doctors. No... attention. You understand? I have a board meeting tomorrow. Investors watching every move. I can't afford rumors about my health."

"Better rumors than a funeral."

Hartman stood abruptly, swaying slightly. For a moment, Max thought he'd collapse. But the CEO steadied himself against the chair back, his knuckles white. "I appreciate your concern, Mr...?"

"Monroe. Max Monroe."

"Mr. Monroe." Hartman's smile was ghastly, all teeth and no warmth. "But I'm fine. Just need some air. Some sleep. Tomorrow I'll be laughing about this."

He moved toward the door with the careful precision of a drunk trying to pass a sobriety test. Max watched him go, every instinct screaming to intervene, to grab the man and drag him to a hospital, to hell with the mission.

But Hartman paused at the threshold, one hand braced against the doorframe. Without turning, he said, "That woman. Mariana. She asked about our new facial recognition contracts. Government applications. Seemed very... interested."

"Did you tell her anything?"

"I'm not an idiot, Monroe." Hartman's laugh was hollow. "I've been in this business long enough to recognize a honey trap when I see one. I told her nothing."

Then why did she kiss you? Max wanted to scream the question, but Hartman was already gone, disappearing into the corridor beyond.

Max sat back down, his whiskey forgotten. His phone buzzed—a message from Langley's monitoring team. They'd been tracking Hartman's biometrics through the man's smartwatch, standard surveillance for high-value targets at events like this.

```json
{
  "subject": "Hartman, Gerald",
  "heart_rate": "118 bpm",
  "blood_pressure": "elevated",
  "status": "MONITORING"
}
```

Not critical. Not yet. But climbing.

Max stared at the message, paralyzed by impossible mathematics. If he acted now, he might save Hartman but lose any chance of stopping Mariana before she struck again. If he waited, Hartman might die, but Max would remain in position to prevent the next attack.

One life versus potentially dozens.

The calculus of espionage had never felt so cold.

He typed a response to Langley: *Subject may have been exposed. Maintaining cover. Request medical standby without subject knowledge.*

The reply came within seconds: *Negative. Cannot risk exposure. Monitor only.*

Max's hand clenched around his phone hard enough to make the case creak. Through the window, Geneva glittered with indifferent beauty. Somewhere out there, Mariana was probably already selecting her next target, her lips still tingling with whatever cocktail of neurotoxin and desire she'd delivered to Gerald Hartman.

And somewhere closer, Hartman was walking back to his hotel room, convinced he'd survived a honey trap, unaware that the real trap was still closing around him.

Max stood and walked to the window, pressing his forehead against the cool glass. His reflection stared back at him—a ghost in expensive clothes, haunted by choices not yet made.

His phone buzzed again. Another update on Hartman's vitals.

Heart rate: 125 bpm.

Rising.

**Scene 6: Max returns to the reception t...**

**Scene 6: Max returns to the reception to find Mariana watching him**

The reception room hummed with cultivated conversation and the delicate clink of crystal. Max stepped back through the double doors, his pulse still elevated from finding Hartman in distress, and immediately felt the weight of observation.

Mariana stood near the far window, backlit by the amber glow of Geneva's nightscape. She held a champagne flute that hadn't been touched—he could tell by the bubbles still rising in perfect columns. Her eyes tracked him across the room with the patience of a chess player who'd already calculated the next five moves.

Max forced himself to maintain his casual stride, accepting a fresh drink from a passing server. The condensation on the glass felt sharp against his palm. He made a show of scanning the crowd, as if looking for someone, before allowing his gaze to settle on her.

Their eyes met.

She smiled—not the warm, practiced smile she'd deployed during their previous encounters, but something cooler. More honest. The kind of expression a collector might wear when examining a particularly interesting specimen.

Max crossed to her, navigating between clusters of tech executives and venture capitalists. The Persian carpet beneath his feet absorbed sound, creating pockets of intimacy in the crowded space. Somewhere, a string quartet played Vivaldi.

"You disappeared," Mariana said as he approached. Her accent seemed more pronounced now, the Russian consonants sharper. "I was beginning to think I'd scared you away."

"Just needed some air." Max gestured with his glass toward the terrace doors. "These events can be overwhelming."

"Can they?" She tilted her head, studying him. The movement exposed the elegant line of her throat. "You strike me as someone who thrives in chaos, Mr. Monroe. Not someone who runs from it."

The music swelled behind them, violins climbing toward a crescendo.

"Maybe I went to check on Gerald," Max said, testing the waters. "He looked unwell."

Mariana's expression didn't change, but something flickered in her eyes—amusement, perhaps, or recognition. "Did he? I hadn't noticed." She took her first sip of champagne, her lips barely touching the rim. "Though I suppose some people are more observant than others."

Max felt the conversation shift, like a knife sliding between his ribs. She was playing with him, but he couldn't determine the rules.

"Is he alright?" she continued, her voice carrying just enough concern to sound genuine to anyone listening. But Max heard the undercurrent—the test embedded in the question.

"Says it's an allergic reaction."

"Hmm." Mariana turned to face the window, and Max found himself standing beside her, both of them reflected in the dark glass like conspirators. "It's important to recognize the difference, don't you think?"

"Between what?"

"Between someone who is truly suffering..." She paused, watching his reflection. "And someone who is merely uncomfortable. One requires intervention. The other..." She lifted one shoulder in an elegant shrug. "The other is simply part of growth. Of transformation."

The string quartet transitioned to something minor-keyed and melancholic. Max's reflection looked tense beside hers, his jaw tight.

"That's a rather clinical perspective," he said.

"I've learned that compassion without discernment is just sentimentality." Mariana turned to face him fully now, close enough that he could smell her perfume—something with notes of bergamot and smoke. "And sentimentality gets people killed."

The words hung between them like a blade.

Max held her gaze, aware that his next response would matter. That she was cataloging his reactions, filing them away in whatever mental database she maintained. He thought of Hartman's burning lips, his disoriented expression, the way he'd touched his mouth as if trying to extinguish invisible flames.

"You speak from experience," Max said.

"Don't we all?" Her smile returned, warmer now but no less dangerous. "You've done well these past few days, Max. May I call you Max?"

"Of course."

"Max." She tested the name, rolling it around her mouth like wine. "You've asked all the right questions. Laughed at the appropriate moments. Demonstrated just enough knowledge to be interesting without being threatening." She stepped closer, and Max felt his body respond despite every warning signal firing in his brain. "It's almost as if you've done this before."

His heart hammered against his ribs. "Done what?"

"Played the game." Her hand rose, and for a moment Max thought she might touch his face. Instead, she reached past him to set her champagne flute on a nearby table. The movement brought her within inches of him, her breath warm against his collar. "The question is—whose side are you playing for?"

Before Max could respond, she stepped back, the professional mask sliding into place so smoothly he might have imagined the intimacy.

"I should circulate," she said, her voice bright and social again. "But we should have dinner tomorrow. There's a lovely place near the lake—quiet, intimate. We could discuss your investment interests more... thoroughly."

"I'd like that."

"Good." Mariana's eyes held his for one more beat, and Max saw something in their depths that made his blood run cold and hot simultaneously—the look of a predator who'd just decided whether to kill or keep playing with her prey. "Nine o'clock. I'll text you the address."

She glided away, leaving Max standing alone by the window. His reflection stared back at him, and he barely recognized the man he saw—caught between the role he was playing and the danger he was courting.

He pulled out his phone, fingers moving automatically to compose a message to Sarah. But he stopped, thumb hovering over the screen. What would he say? That he thought Mariana had poisoned Hartman? That she'd just issued what might be a threat or an invitation, and he couldn't tell which?

That some part of him wanted to find out?

Max deleted the half-written message and pocketed the phone. Across the room, Mariana laughed at something a German industrialist said, her hand resting lightly on his arm. She didn't look in Max's direction, but he knew—with the certainty of prey finally understanding the hunter's patience—that she was aware of every move he made.

The string quartet finished their piece to polite applause. In the moment of silence before they began again, Max heard his own heartbeat, steady and insistent.

Tomorrow at nine, then.

He finished his drink and set the glass down with deliberate care, as if the simple act could anchor him. Outside the window, Geneva glittered like a jewel box, beautiful and cold. Somewhere in that sprawl of light and shadow, Hartman was probably still touching his burning lips, wondering what had happened.

Max wondered the same thing.

And he wondered if, by tomorrow night, he'd be asking himself the same question.
