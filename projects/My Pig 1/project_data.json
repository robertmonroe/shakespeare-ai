He has a scattering of freckles across his nose and cheeks, a testament to his love of playing outdoors. He usually wears comfortable, slightly worn clothes – jeans, t-shirts featuring his favorite superheroes, and sneakers that are always a little scuffed from his adventures. He often has dirt under his fingernails.",
            "personality_traits": "Resourceful, Cautious, Determined",
            "background": "Johnny has always been a bit of an outsider in his city neighborhood. He's a dreamer with a vivid imagination, often feeling stifled by the concrete jungle surrounding him. He longs for open spaces and a connection with nature. His parents, while loving, are busy with their demanding jobs and sometimes struggle to understand his imaginative world.",

Through his friendship with Arnie and the challenges they face, he learns to stand up for what he believes in, develops greater confidence, and strengthens his bond with his parents, ultimately understanding their love and concern for him."

            "physical_description": "Arnie is a pot-bellied pig with soft, pink skin and a curly tail that wags enthusiastically. He has large, expressive brown eyes that seem to understand everything. He's surprisingly agile and graceful, especially when he's dancing. He wears a small, custom-made blue collar with a tiny bell that jingles when he moves.",
            "personality_traits": "Resourceful, Cautious, Determined",

            "external_conflicts": "Avoiding capture, adapting to city life, facing prejudice and fear from people who don't understand him, the threat of being returned to the farm.",
            "character_arc": "Arnie begins as a runaway pig seeking freedom. He finds a true home and purpose through his friendship with Johnny, becoming a symbol of acceptance and the power of unconventional bonds. He learns to trust humans and finds a place where he can freely express himself."
