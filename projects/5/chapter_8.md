## Chapter 8: The Operation

**Scene 1: Max conducts final equipment c...**

**Scene 1: Max conducts final equipment checks in the surveillance van**

The van smelled of stale coffee, electrical equipment, and nervous sweat. Max adjusted the brightness on the center monitor, his eyes scanning the grid of surveillance feeds that bathed the cramped interior in a cold blue glow. Outside, the streets of Brussels were alive with evening traffic, but inside this converted delivery vehicle, the world had contracted to pixels and frequencies.

"Audio check on channel three," he said, his voice low and controlled despite the adrenaline coursing through his veins.

"Clear as crystal," responded Jenkins, the tech specialist squeezed into the corner behind a bank of recording equipment. His fingers danced across a laptop keyboard, adjusting levels on a digital mixer that looked like it belonged in a recording studio rather than a spy operation.

Max's gaze fixed on the screen showing the front entrance of the Palais d'Egmont. Luxury vehicles arrived in a steady stream, disgorging diplomats and their partners in evening wear. The scene looked like something from a glossy magazine—all champagne elegance and refined power.

Then he saw her.

The black Mercedes pulled to the curb, and Viktor emerged first, straightening his tuxedo with practiced ease. He turned, extending his hand, and Elena stepped out into the golden light spilling from the palace entrance.

Max's breath caught.

She wore a deep emerald gown that caught the light like water, her dark hair swept up to reveal the elegant line of her neck. The woman he'd spent countless hours with in safe houses and training rooms had transformed into someone who belonged in this world of wealth and influence. But Max could see what others couldn't—the slight tension in her shoulders, the way her smile didn't quite reach her eyes.

"Target acquired. They're entering now," said Rodriguez from the passenger seat, tracking them through a telephoto lens.

Max tapped the encrypted transmitter. "Nightingale, do you copy?"

A pause that lasted three heartbeats too long. Then her voice, barely a whisper, came through crystal clear in his earpiece. "Copy."

"You look beautiful." The words escaped before he could stop them, unprofessional and revealing. Jenkins glanced at him but said nothing.

"Is that mission-critical information, Control?" Her tone carried the ghost of humor, but Max heard the tremor beneath it.

"Negative. Just stating facts." He forced himself back into operational mode, his fingers pulling up the building's floor plan on a secondary screen. "Remember, you have eyes on every exit. We've confirmed Viktor's driver is parked on Rue du Grand Cerf. When you're ready to move, the headache protocol initiates phase two."

"Understood."

On the screen, Viktor's hand rested possessively on the small of Elena's back as they ascended the palace steps. Max's jaw tightened.

"Vitals?" he asked Jenkins without taking his eyes off the monitors.

"Heart rate elevated but stable. One-twenty. Respiration normal. She's holding it together."

The couple disappeared through the ornate entrance. Max switched to the interior feeds—grainy images from micro-cameras their advance team had planted two days ago. The reception hall glittered with crystal chandeliers and the flash of jewelry. Waiters circulated with champagne flutes. A string quartet played something classical that Max couldn't identify.

"Thermal imaging shows approximately sixty-seven individuals in the main hall," Rodriguez reported. "Security detail of twelve, positioned here, here, and here." He pointed to heat signatures along the perimeter.

Max tracked Elena's emerald dress through the crowd. She accepted a champagne glass, laughed at something a Belgian diplomat said, played the role of the devoted wife with disturbing perfection. Viktor never strayed far, his hand always finding her elbow, her waist, maintaining ownership.

"She's good," Jenkins murmured. "Really good."

Too good, Max thought. The line between performance and reality had a way of blurring in deep cover operations. He'd seen it happen before—operatives who disappeared into their legends and never quite found their way back.

"Nightingale, status check," he said into the mic.

"Making the rounds. Viktor is introducing me to the German attaché." Her voice remained steady, but Max could hear the ambient noise of the party—laughter, clinking glasses, the murmur of diplomatic small talk. "The attaché's wife has strong opinions about Belgian chocolate."

"Copy that. You're doing great. Remember, two hours minimum before phase two."

"Two hours. Understood."

Max settled back in his chair, but his muscles refused to relax. The monitors showed Elena moving through the crowd with Viktor, a vision of elegance and poise. No one watching would suspect she was memorizing faces, cataloging security positions, counting the minutes until she could slip away and betray the man whose arm she held.

"Long night ahead," Rodriguez said, pouring coffee from a thermos into a chipped mug. The bitter smell filled the van.

Max checked his watch. 7:47 PM. In approximately two hours and fifteen minutes, if everything went according to plan, Elena would claim a headache and leave. She would enter Viktor's house alone. She would crack his safe and photograph enough classified intelligence to cripple Russian operations across Western Europe.

And if anything went wrong, she would be arrested, tortured, or simply disappear.

"Yeah," Max said, accepting the coffee Rodriguez offered. "Long night."

On the screen, Elena tilted her head back and laughed at something Viktor whispered in her ear. The gesture looked natural, spontaneous, real. Max forced himself to look away, focusing instead on the security feeds, the equipment readouts, anything but the woman in the emerald dress who held his operation—and something more dangerous—in her hands.

Jenkins adjusted a dial, and Elena's voice came through again, this time conversing in flawless Russian with someone off-camera. Max didn't speak the language, but he didn't need to. He could hear the confidence in her tone, the easy charm that made people trust her.

The van settled into tense silence, broken only by the hum of electronics and the occasional burst of static. Outside, Brussels lived its normal life. Inside, three men watched screens and waited, knowing that in the next few hours, everything could go perfectly right or catastrophically wrong.

Max's hand rested near the transmitter, ready to abort if he saw anything—anything at all—that suggested Elena was in danger.

The operation had begun.

**Scene 2: Elena navigates the diplomatic...**

**Scene 2: Elena navigates the diplomatic reception**

The crystal chandeliers cast pools of golden light across the ballroom's marble floor, each fixture worth more than most people earned in a year. Elena stood beside Viktor, her champagne flute held at precisely the right angle, her smile fixed in place like a porcelain mask. The French ambassador's wife was speaking—something about her daughter's upcoming wedding in Provence—and Elena nodded at appropriate intervals, murmuring responses that required no actual thought.

"How wonderful," she said, watching the woman's lips move while her mind calculated minutes. Seven-thirty. She needed to wait until at least eight-fifteen. Too early would seem suspicious. Too late risked Viktor deciding to leave early himself.

Viktor's hand settled on the small of her back, possessive and warm through the silk of her emerald gown. "Darling, you remember Ambassador Chen?"

Elena turned, extending her hand with practiced grace. "Of course. Ambassador, what a pleasure."

Chen's grip was firm, his smile diplomatic. "Mrs. Volkov. You look radiant this evening."

"You're too kind." The words came automatically, her tongue operating independently from her consciousness. Beneath the expensive fabric, sweat gathered between her shoulder blades. The phone Max had given her sat in her clutch purse, a small weight that felt heavy as lead.

Viktor launched into conversation about trade agreements, his voice taking on that particular timbre he used when networking—confident, charming, utterly false. Elena had heard it a thousand times. She let the words wash over her, focusing instead on her breathing. In through the nose, slow and measured. Out through slightly parted lips, careful not to disturb her lipstick.

The ballroom hummed with conversation in a dozen languages. Waiters glided between clusters of guests, their trays laden with canapés and champagne. A string quartet played Vivaldi in the corner, the music barely audible above the din. Elena caught fragments of conversations as they drifted past—the situation in the Middle East, commodity prices, someone's scandalous affair with a junior attaché.

"Don't you think, Elena?"

She blinked, realizing Viktor had directed a question at her. Ambassador Chen watched her expectantly.

"I'm sorry," she said, touching her temple with two fingers. "I'm afraid I'm developing the most dreadful headache. The champagne, perhaps."

Viktor's eyes narrowed slightly—a microexpression that anyone else would have missed. But Elena had spent five years learning to read those minute shifts in his features. Suspicion? Annoyance? She couldn't tell.

"Some water might help," Chen suggested kindly.

"Yes, of course." Viktor signaled a passing waiter with the efficiency of a man accustomed to immediate service. "Water for my wife."

The glass appeared in seconds, condensation already forming on the crystal. Elena sipped, using the moment to check her watch. Seven-fifty-two. Close enough. She needed to plant the seed now, let it grow gradually.

"Thank you," she said, returning the glass to the waiter's tray. "I think I just need a moment. Please, don't let me interrupt."

Viktor's hand tightened on her waist. "Are you certain you're all right?"

"Just tired. It's been a long week." She leaned into him slightly, playing the dutiful wife seeking comfort. His cologne—something expensive and woody—filled her nostrils. Once, that scent had meant safety. Now it made her stomach turn.

They moved through the crowd, Viktor introducing her to a Romanian diplomat, then a British trade representative, then someone from the German embassy whose name she immediately forgot. Elena performed her role flawlessly—the intelligent but not threatening wife, beautiful but not overshadowing, interested but not intrusive. She'd perfected this character over years of practice, molding herself into exactly what Viktor wanted.

What he needed.

What he could control.

Eight-oh-seven. The pain behind her eyes was becoming real now, born of stress and adrenaline rather than champagne. She pressed her fingers to her temple again, this time allowing a small wince to cross her features.

"Darling." She touched Viktor's sleeve lightly. "I'm so sorry, but the headache is getting worse."

He was mid-conversation with the Spanish ambassador, discussing something about shipping routes. His jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. "Can it wait? Ambassador Ruiz was just—"

"Of course." Elena stepped back, her smile apologetic. "I'll just find somewhere quiet to sit."

She made it three steps before Viktor called her back. "Elena."

Her heart stuttered. Had she miscalculated? Pushed too hard?

But when she turned, his expression showed only mild irritation. "Take the car. I'll catch a ride with Dmitri later."

"Are you certain? I don't want to inconvenience—"

"It's fine." He waved dismissively, already turning back to Ruiz. "Andrei will drive you. Go rest."

Elena nodded, touching his arm in a gesture of wifely gratitude before making her way toward the exit. She moved slowly, stopping to say goodbye to two acquaintances, accepting sympathetic murmurs about her headache. Every instinct screamed at her to run, but she forced herself to maintain the elegant glide she'd perfected at finishing school.

The cool night air hit her face as she stepped outside, and she drew in a shaky breath. Andrei, their driver, was already pulling the car around—a black Mercedes that cost more than most people's houses.

The passenger door opened. Elena slid inside, the leather seat cool against her bare shoulders. Through the tinted window, she could see the ballroom's golden glow, the silhouettes of guests moving like shadow puppets.

Viktor was in there, unsuspecting.

And she was heading to his study to commit treason.

"Home, Mrs. Volkov?" Andrei's voice came from the front seat.

Elena closed her eyes, her hands clasped tightly in her lap to stop them shaking.

"Yes," she said quietly. "Home."

**Scene 3: Elena claims a severe headache...**

The chandeliers of the embassy ballroom cast prismatic light across the sea of evening gowns and tuxedos, but Elena saw only blurred shapes now. She pressed two fingers to her temple, letting her face go pale—not difficult when genuine nausea churned in her stomach.

"Viktor." She touched his arm lightly, interrupting his conversation with the French ambassador. "I'm so sorry, but I need to—"

He turned, irritation flashing across his features before he registered her expression. "What is it?"

"My head." She winced, making it real. "It came on so suddenly. The lights, the noise—I think it's a migraine."

Viktor's jaw tightened. The reception was critical for his cover, and her presence beside him lent legitimacy to his facade as a devoted husband. But other guests were already glancing their way, concern evident on their faces.

"You look terrible," the ambassador's wife murmured sympathetically.

Viktor's hand gripped Elena's elbow, firm enough that she felt his displeasure through the silk of her gown. "I'll take you home."

"No." Elena shook her head, immediately regretting the movement. "Please, you can't leave. The Austrian delegation hasn't even arrived yet. I'll just take the car. I have my medication at home."

He studied her face, searching for deception. Elena held his gaze, willing herself not to look away, not to let fear show. After what felt like an eternity, he nodded curtly.

"Fine. Dmitri will drive you." He signaled to their driver, who materialized from his post near the entrance. "But call me when you arrive. I want to know you made it safely."

"Of course." Elena managed a weak smile, already turning away. Each step toward the exit felt like wading through deep water.

The cool night air hit her face as she emerged from the embassy. Dmitri opened the rear door of the black Mercedes, and she slid inside, the leather seats creaking softly. Through the tinted window, she watched the illuminated building recede as they pulled away.

Her purse sat in her lap, innocent-looking, except for the phone Max had given her tucked inside. She could feel it there, a small weight that seemed to burn through the fabric.

The drive took seventeen minutes. Elena counted each one, her pulse accelerating as familiar streets passed by. Their house rose before them, a modern fortress of glass and stone, every window dark.

"Thank you, Dmitri." She stepped out before he could open her door. "You should return to the embassy. Mr. Volkov may need the car."

The driver hesitated. "I was instructed to see you inside, Mrs. Volkov."

"I'm perfectly capable of walking to my own door." She softened her tone, adding a pained smile. "Please. The headache is worse, and I just need quiet and darkness."

Dmitri relented, waiting only until she'd unlocked the front door before pulling away. Elena watched the taillights disappear down the drive, then stepped inside and closed the door.

Silence engulfed her.

The house felt cavernous, every shadow deeper than it should be. She kicked off her heels, leaving them by the door, and reached into her purse with trembling fingers. The phone's screen glowed to life.

A soft click in her ear made her jump before she remembered the tiny earpiece Max had insisted she wear, hidden beneath her upswept hair.

"I'm here." His voice was quiet, steady. "I've got you on GPS. You're doing great, Elena."

She exhaled shakily, gripping the phone. "The driver's gone."

"I know. I watched him leave. You have the house to yourself." A pause. "How are you holding up?"

"Terrified," she whispered, moving through the foyer. Her stockinged feet made no sound on the marble floor.

"That's normal. Use it. Fear keeps you sharp." His voice wrapped around her like a tether to safety. "Take the hallway to your right. Viktor's study is the third door."

She knew the way—had walked it a hundred times—but everything looked different now. The abstract paintings on the walls seemed to watch her. The antique table where Viktor kept his keys cast strange shadows in the ambient light from the street.

"I'm at the door," she breathed.

"Good. Remember, you belong there. You're his wife. You have every right to be in that room."

But her hand shook as she turned the handle. The study door swung open on well-oiled hinges, revealing Viktor's domain. Mahogany desk. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. The scent of leather and his cologne.

And there, behind a reproduction of a Kandinsky painting—the safe.

"I see it," she said.

"Then let's do this." Max's voice held a note of tension now, the calm fraying at the edges. "You've got time, but not much. Move deliberately. Don't rush."

Elena crossed to the painting, her reflection ghosting across the glass that protected it. She looked like a stranger—face too pale, eyes too wide, dressed for a party while committing treason.

The painting swung aside easily, revealing the safe's digital keypad. Her fingers hovered over the numbers.

"Elena?" Max's voice pulled her back. "Talk to me."

"What if I'm wrong? What if the combination doesn't work?"

"Then we abort and try another time. But you're not wrong. Trust yourself."

She closed her eyes, remembering Viktor's fingers moving across the keypad, the pattern she'd memorized from a dozen stolen glances. Four digits. Two-seven-nine-three.

Elena pressed the first number. The keypad beeped softly, the sound impossibly loud in the silent house.

Two.

Seven.

Nine.

Her finger trembled over the final digit.

Three.

A mechanical whir. A heavy click.

The safe door released.

"I'm in," she whispered, and heard Max's exhale of relief echo her own.

"Beautiful. Now photograph everything. Use the camera function on the phone I gave you. Make sure each image is clear—we won't get a second chance at this."

Elena pulled the safe door open fully, and her breath caught. Files. Dozens of them, organized with military precision. She recognized some of the labels—NATO designations, technology codenames, strings of letters and numbers that meant nothing to her but would mean everything to Max's people.

She pulled out her phone and began to photograph, working methodically despite the tremor in her hands. Each click of the camera shutter seemed to seal her fate a little more completely.

Page after page. File after file. Lists of names—God, so many names. People who didn't know their covers were compromised, their lives documented in Viktor's meticulous handwriting.

"How much longer?" she asked, her voice barely audible.

"You're doing great. Keep going. Almost—"

Max's voice cut off mid-sentence.

Elena froze. "Max?"

Static crackled in her ear, then his voice returned, sharp with urgency. "Elena, I'm picking up a vehicle approaching the house. Fast."

Her heart stopped. "What?"

"It's a black Mercedes. Same make as yours. Elena, I think it's Viktor."

The phone nearly slipped from her sweating palm. "That's impossible. He wouldn't leave the reception this early."

"I don't know what to tell you, but someone's coming up your drive right now, and they're moving like they have a purpose."

Through the study window, Elena saw headlights sweep across the lawn.

"Finish photographing," Max said, his voice tight. "Right now. Whatever you haven't gotten, leave it. You need to close that safe and get out of there."

Her hands moved on autopilot, snapping pictures of the remaining files even as her mind screamed at her to run. The headlights grew brighter. A car door slammed.

"Safe closed. Painting back in place. I'm—"

The front door opened.

Elena's breath stopped. She stood frozen in the center of Viktor's study, the phone still in her hand, as footsteps echoed through the foyer.

Heavy. Purposeful. Coming closer.

"Elena." Max's voice was barely a whisper. "Hide the phone. Act natural. You're just looking for your medication, remember? You have a headache."

She shoved the phone into her clutch, her mind racing through excuses, explanations, anything that might—

The study door opened.

Viktor stood in the doorway, still in his tuxedo, his eyes cold and assessing as they swept

**Scene 4: Elena's hands tremble as she w...**

**Scene 4: Elena's hands tremble as she works the safe combination**

The mahogany-paneled study smelled of leather and Viktor's cologne—sandalwood and something sharper, medicinal. Elena's fingers hovered over the safe's dial, the numbers Max had given her burning in her mind like a brand: 17-34-8-22.

Right to seventeen.

Her hand shook so badly the first time that she overshot the mark. The dial spun uselessly. She pulled back, pressing her palm against her thigh to steady it, feeling the silk of her evening gown stick to her sweat-dampened skin.

"Come on," she whispered to herself. "Come on."

She tried again. Seventeen. Left to thirty-four. Right to eight. Left to—

The dial slipped. Wrong again.

"Breathe," came Max's voice through the tiny earpiece, so quiet she almost missed it. He was watching through the camera hidden in her necklace, seeing everything she saw. "You have time. Viktor's still at the reception. Take your breath and try again."

Elena closed her eyes, counted to three, opened them. The safe sat embedded in the wall behind a Kandinsky print she'd never liked—all chaotic angles and aggressive colors. How many times had she sat in this room, reading while Viktor worked, never knowing what secrets lived behind that painting?

Third attempt. Her fingers found their rhythm this time, muscle memory taking over where conscious thought had failed. Seventeen. Thirty-four. Eight. Twenty-two.

The lock clicked.

The sound seemed impossibly loud in the silent house. Elena's heart hammered against her ribs as she pulled the heavy door open.

Inside, the safe was meticulously organized—so perfectly Viktor. Manila folders stood in neat rows, each labeled in his precise handwriting. USB drives in a velvet-lined case. A stack of passports bound with a rubber band. And there, on the top shelf, a leather portfolio embossed with the Russian Federation seal.

"Oh God," Elena breathed.

"What do you see?" Max's voice was tight with urgency.

She pulled out the first folder with trembling hands. NATO DEPLOYMENT—EASTERN EUROPE. The tab read. Inside, detailed maps marked with troop positions, supply routes, defensive capabilities. Information that could get people killed.

The camera Max had given her was small enough to fit in her clutch, disguised as a compact. Elena set it on Viktor's desk, angling it toward the documents, and began photographing. Click. Advance. Click. Advance. The mechanical rhythm steadied her breathing.

Second folder: TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITION—CLASSIFIED. Specifications for missile defense systems. Encryption protocols. Satellite imagery analysis.

"Faster," Max urged. "You're doing great, but move faster."

Elena's hands found their efficiency, years of managing Viktor's household translating into methodical precision now. She worked through the folders systematically, photographing each page, returning them to their exact positions. The camera's tiny LED blinked green with each shot, a firefly pulse in the dim study.

She was reaching for the leather portfolio when her phone buzzed in her clutch.

Everything stopped.

The phone buzzed again. Not the secure phone Max had given her—her regular phone. Viktor's name glowed on the screen.

Elena stared at it, paralyzed. He never called during receptions. Never.

"Don't answer," Max said. "Keep working."

But her hands had already frozen. The phone buzzed a third time, then fell silent. A moment later, a text appeared: *Coming home. Headache worse?*

The words blurred as Elena read them. Her headache. The excuse she'd used to leave. He was checking on her.

Or he suspected.

"Elena." Max's voice cut through her panic. "Listen to me. You have maybe ten minutes. Finish the portfolio and get out."

Ten minutes. She could do ten minutes.

Elena opened the leather portfolio with shaking hands. Inside were lists—pages and pages of names, photographs, locations. Undercover operatives embedded across Europe and North America. She recognized some of the faces from diplomatic functions, people she'd smiled at, made small talk with, never knowing they were living double lives.

People like her, she realized. People pretending to be someone they weren't.

The camera clicked steadily as she photographed each page. Twenty names. Thirty. Forty-two in total. Each one a life in her hands.

"Last page," she whispered. "Almost done."

She was returning the portfolio to its shelf when she heard it—the distinctive purr of Viktor's Mercedes in the driveway.

Time stopped.

"Elena, move." Max's voice was sharp now, commanding. "Close the safe. Hide the camera. Now."

Her hands obeyed before her mind could catch up. Portfolio back. Folders aligned. Safe door swung shut, dial spun. The Kandinsky swung back into place as headlights swept across the study window.

The camera. Where could she—

The antique globe in the corner. Elena yanked open its hinged top—Viktor kept his best vodka inside—and dropped the camera among the bottles. It clinked against glass, too loud, but there was no time.

She heard the front door open.

Viktor's footsteps in the foyer, heavy and purposeful.

Elena positioned herself by the window, one hand pressed to her temple, trying to look like a woman nursing a headache. Trying not to look like a woman who'd just committed treason.

The study door opened.

Viktor filled the doorway, his tuxedo jacket already removed, tie loosened. His pale eyes found her immediately, and Elena saw something in them she'd never seen before.

Suspicion.

"Darling," he said, his voice soft and dangerous. "What are you doing in my study?"

**Scene 5: Elena hears Viktor's car in th...**

**Scene 5: Elena hears Viktor's car in the driveway**

The click of the safe's lock mechanism sliding into place sounded like a gunshot in the silent study.

Elena's hands were still trembling against the cool metal when she heard it—the distinctive purr of Viktor's Mercedes turning into the driveway. Her blood turned to ice.

*No. No, no, no.*

He wasn't supposed to be back for another two hours. The reception was scheduled until midnight.

The camera. She snatched it from where it lay on Viktor's desk, her fingers fumbling with the small device. Where could she hide it? The desk drawer—no, he'd check there first. Behind the books—no time. Her evening clutch was too small.

Car doors slammed outside.

With shaking hands, Elena shoved the camera into the hidden pocket of her dress, the one she'd had specially sewn into the silk lining. The hard edges pressed against her ribs, foreign and damning. She could feel her pulse hammering where the device touched her skin.

The front door opened downstairs.

She forced herself to breathe, to think. Why would she be in here? What excuse could possibly—

"Elena!" Viktor's voice carried up the stairs, sharp with irritation.

She moved toward the door, each step measured, fighting every instinct that screamed at her to run. Her reflection caught in the window—pale, eyes too wide, a woman who looked exactly like someone who'd just been caught stealing state secrets.

Compose yourself. You're his wife. You belong here.

The study door swung open before she reached it.

Viktor filled the doorway, his broad shoulders blocking the light from the hallway. His tuxedo was still immaculate, but his face was flushed—from alcohol or anger, Elena couldn't tell. His pale blue eyes swept the room before settling on her with an intensity that made her stomach drop.

"Viktor." She managed to keep her voice steady. "You're home early."

He didn't move from the doorway, didn't soften his expression. "I asked you a question downstairs." His Russian accent thickened when he was angry. "What are you doing in my study?"

The air in the room felt suddenly thin. Elena's mind raced through possibilities, discarding them as quickly as they formed. The wrong answer here could cost her everything.

"I was looking for aspirin." The lie came out smooth, practiced. "My headache—I thought you might have some in your desk."

Viktor's eyes narrowed. He took a step into the room, and Elena fought the urge to step back. Predators could sense fear.

"Aspirin." He said the word slowly, tasting it for truth. "In my private study. Not in any of the three bathrooms in this house. Not in the kitchen where we keep the medicine cabinet."

"I wasn't thinking clearly. The pain—"

"The safe is closed." Viktor's gaze shifted to the wall behind his desk, where the painting hung perfectly straight over the hidden safe. "I always leave it slightly ajar when I'm home. It's a habit."

Elena's heart stopped.

"Did you touch it?" He moved closer, each footfall deliberate on the Persian rug. The smell of whiskey and expensive cologne preceded him. "Did you touch my safe, Elena?"

The camera pressed against her ribs like a brand. If he searched her, if he found it, there would be no explanation that could save her. She thought of the photographs stored in its memory—NATO positions, classified documents, the names of operatives. Evidence of treason.

Evidence of her treason.

"I don't know the combination." True, until two hours ago. "Why would I touch your safe?"

Viktor stopped inches from her. Close enough that she could see the blood vessels in his eyes, the tight set of his jaw. Close enough that he could hear her heart pounding if he listened.

"That's what I'm asking you." His hand shot out and gripped her upper arm, fingers digging into the soft flesh. "Why are you really in here?"

The pain focused her. Elena met his eyes, channeling every ounce of the rage and resentment she'd buried for five years of this marriage. It wasn't hard—the fury was always there, just beneath the surface.

"Let go of me."

"Answer the question."

"I told you—"

"You're lying." Viktor's other hand came up to her face, fingers gripping her chin, forcing her to maintain eye contact. "I can always tell when you're lying. Your left eye twitches. Just slightly. Right... there."

His thumb pressed against her cheekbone, and Elena realized with crystalline clarity that she might die in this room. Viktor had killed before—she'd heard the whispers, seen the fear in the eyes of men who crossed him. What was one more body, even if it belonged to his wife?

Especially if that wife was a traitor.

"The reception," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Why did you leave early?"

Something flickered across Viktor's face—surprise, perhaps, that she'd dared to ask. His grip loosened fractionally.

"Dimitri called. Said there was suspicious activity on our network. Someone trying to access classified files." His eyes searched her face. "Strange timing, don't you think? The same night you suddenly develop a headache and leave early?"

The room tilted. They knew. Somehow, they knew.

Viktor's phone buzzed in his pocket. He ignored it, but it buzzed again. And again.

With a curse, he released Elena and pulled out the phone. His face went rigid as he read the screen.

"Get out," he said quietly.

"What?"

"Get out of my study. Now. We'll finish this conversation later." But his attention was already on the phone, his fingers flying across the screen.

Elena didn't wait for him to change his mind. She walked past him on legs that felt disconnected from her body, through the doorway, into the hall. Every step away from that room felt like a miracle.

She made it to the stairs before her knees buckled.

Behind her, she heard Viktor's voice, low and deadly, speaking rapid Russian into his phone. She caught only fragments: "...breach...trace it...find them..."

The camera burned against her ribs.

She had to get out. Had to get the files to Max. Had to—

Her phone vibrated in her clutch. A single word from Max: *ABORT.*

Too late for that.

Elena descended the stairs, each step taking her deeper into a nightmare from which there would be no waking.

**Scene 6: Max listens helplessly through...**

The surveillance van smelled of stale coffee and electrical components. Max sat rigid in the cramped space, headphones pressed against his ears, listening to the silence from Elena's earpiece. The monitors before him showed thermal imaging of Viktor's house—two heat signatures in the study, one significantly larger than the other.

His finger trembled over the red emergency extraction button.

"Elena?" Viktor's voice crackled through the connection, sharp with suspicion. "What are you doing in here?"

Max's stomach dropped. Through the audio feed, he heard Elena's sharp intake of breath.

"Viktor." Her voice wavered—perfectly calibrated fear, Max realized. "I... I was looking for aspirin. The headache, it's worse than I thought."

"Aspirin." Viktor's footsteps echoed on hardwood. "In my study."

"I couldn't find any in the bathroom. I thought maybe you kept some in your desk." A pause. "I'm sorry, I should have called you first."

Max's hand hovered millimeters from the extraction button. His other hand gripped the edge of the console so hard his knuckles had gone white. The thermal imaging showed Viktor moving closer to Elena. Closer to the safe.

"You look flushed," Viktor said, his tone softening slightly. "Come, let me see you."

Through the earpiece, Max heard the rustle of fabric, footsteps. He imagined Viktor's hands on Elena's face, those same hands that had left bruises Max had photographed weeks ago. His jaw clenched.

"Your pupils are dilated," Viktor observed. "Perhaps you should sit down."

"I just need the aspirin. Then I'll go to bed."

"The medicine cabinet is in the master bathroom. You know this." Viktor's voice hardened again. "Why would you come to my study?"

Max's finger pressed against the button, not quite activating it. His heart hammered against his ribs. The extraction team was three minutes out. Three minutes that might as well be three hours.

"I told you—I got confused. The headache, it's making me disoriented." Elena's breathing quickened. "Viktor, you're scaring me."

A long silence. Max could hear his own pulse in his ears, could feel sweat trickling down his spine despite the van's air conditioning. On the thermal display, Viktor's heat signature remained motionless, a predator assessing prey.

"Sit," Viktor commanded.

The sound of Elena settling into a chair. Viktor's footsteps moved across the room. Max's eyes tracked the thermal signature—heading directly toward the safe.

*No. No, no, no.*

Max's finger depressed the button halfway. One more ounce of pressure and the extraction team would breach the house. Elena would be blown. Their entire network would be compromised. But she'd be alive.

The footsteps stopped.

"This safe," Viktor said slowly. "Has it been touched?"

Max's vision tunneled. He couldn't breathe. Through the headphones, he heard Elena's response, each word crystalline in its terror.

"I don't know what you mean. Viktor, please, my head—"

"The dial. It's warm."

The world reduced to that single point of contact between Max's finger and the button. His entire body screamed at him to press it, to get her out, to hell with the mission. But he'd trained for this. They both had. Trust your asset. Trust the plan.

He couldn't do either.

"Maybe from the heat in the room?" Elena's voice cracked. "I don't understand why you're interrogating me."

"Stand up."

Max heard her comply. The thermal signatures merged—Viktor standing directly in front of her now. His hand moved, and Elena made a small sound of pain.

Max pressed the button.

"Wait." Elena's voice cut through, urgent but controlled. "Wait, I remember. Earlier today, I was in here. You were at the office. I was looking for our marriage certificate—for the insurance paperwork. I must have touched the safe then. I'm sorry, I should have asked permission."

Max's finger froze. The button sat depressed but not fully activated—a hair's breadth from triggering the extraction.

"Insurance paperwork," Viktor repeated flatly.

"For my new doctor. The neurologist you insisted I see about the headaches. They needed proof of marriage for the coverage." She paused. "You don't remember? You told me to handle it last week."

The silence stretched so long Max wondered if his audio feed had died. Then Viktor laughed—a cold, humorless sound.

"Of course. The neurologist." Another pause. "I'll get you the aspirin. Stay here."

Viktor's heat signature moved toward the door. In the van, Max slowly released pressure on the button, his hand shaking so violently he had to grip his wrist to steady it. The extraction team's voice crackled in his other ear: "Command, do we have a go?"

"Stand down," Max whispered. "Repeat, stand down."

Through the earpiece, he heard Elena's breathing—rapid, shallow, alive. Viktor's footsteps receded down the hallway. For now, she was safe.

For now.

Max slumped back in his chair, adrenaline making his muscles twitch. On the monitor, Elena's heat signature remained motionless in the study, a lone figure in the darkness. He watched her for a long moment, then reached for his phone.

The message he typed was simple: *We need to pull you out. Tonight.*

But even as he wrote it, he knew she wouldn't agree. Not with those files still in the safe. Not with Viktor's network still operational.

Not while she still had something to prove.

Max deleted the message unsent and returned his attention to the monitors, settling in for what promised to be the longest night of his life.
