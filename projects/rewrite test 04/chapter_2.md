## Chapter 2: The Long Walk Home

**Scene 1: Marcus and Copper begin their ...**

**Scene 1: Marcus and Copper begin their journey on the coastal trail**

The trailhead looked the same as it always had—weathered wooden sign carved with "Serpent's Cove Trail, 2.1 miles," wild beach roses tangling through the split-rail fence, the packed dirt path disappearing around a bend of wind-twisted pines. Marcus had stood at this exact spot hundreds of times, Copper straining at the leash, eager to bolt down the familiar route.

Today, Copper sat.

"Ready, boy?" Marcus kept his voice light, the same tone he'd used since Copper was a puppy launching himself at every adventure. He adjusted the straps of his backpack—water bottles, Copper's favorite treats, the old beach towel that smelled like home.

Copper looked up at him with those amber eyes, then slowly pushed himself to standing. His back legs trembled slightly before finding their balance.

They started down the trail.

The morning sun filtered through the pine canopy in golden shafts, warming the salt-tinged air. Gulls cried overhead, and somewhere in the distance, waves crashed against rock. Marcus matched his pace to Copper's, watching his dog's gait—still proud, still purposeful, but missing that bounce, that joy of forward motion that used to define him.

They'd barely made it a quarter-mile, maybe less, when Copper stopped.

Not the alert stop of a dog catching an interesting scent. Not the purposeful pause to investigate a rustling in the underbrush. Just... stopped. His sides heaved with the effort of breathing, his tongue lolling as he panted in the cool October air.

Marcus's chest tightened. "Hey, no rush," he said, crouching down. "I think my backpack strap is weird anyway."

He made a show of shrugging off the pack, fiddling with buckles that didn't need adjusting, checking water bottles that were perfectly secure. His fingers moved automatically while his eyes stayed on Copper. Each labored breath seemed to echo in the quiet morning. When had his dog's breathing become so loud? When had the simple act of walking become work?

Copper lowered himself to the ground, his front legs folding first, then his hindquarters settling with careful precision. He rested his graying muzzle on his paws.

"Yeah, good idea," Marcus said. He sat cross-legged beside Copper, one hand finding the familiar spot behind his dog's ears. The fur there had gone almost completely white, he noticed. When had that happened? "We've got all day, right? No hurry."

A jogger passed them on the trail—a college-aged guy with earbuds and expensive running shoes, barely glancing their way as he disappeared around the bend. Marcus watched him go, remembering when he and Copper would have raced past slower hikers, when two miles felt like nothing, when Copper could run for hours and still want more.

Copper's breathing began to slow, settling into something closer to normal. His tail thumped twice against the dirt—a small reassurance, a familiar signal. *I'm okay. We're okay.*

Marcus pulled a water bottle from his pack and poured some into the collapsible bowl he'd brought. Copper lifted his head and drank, slow and deliberate. Water dripped from his jowls when he finished.

"Better?" Marcus asked.

Copper looked at him, and for a moment Marcus could have sworn his dog understood everything—understood that this hike was different, that they both knew it was different, that they were pretending together that everything was fine.

They sat there in the dappled sunlight, the trail empty in both directions, the ocean a distant whisper through the trees. Marcus ran his hand along Copper's back, feeling each knob of spine more prominent than it used to be, each rib more defined.

"Okay," Marcus said finally, standing and shouldering his pack. "Ready for round two?"

Copper rose more easily this time, the rest having helped. He took a few steps forward, then looked back at Marcus as if to say, *Well? Coming?*

Marcus smiled despite the weight in his chest. "Lead the way, old man."

They continued down the trail, slower now, Marcus's expectations recalibrating with each careful step. Two miles. They'd walked it a thousand times. They'd walk it once more.

However long it took.

**Scene 2: During their second rest stop ...**

**Scene 2: During their second rest stop near a familiar pine grove**

The scent hit Marcus before the memory did—sharp pine needles warming in the sun, mixed with salt air and the faint sweetness of wild honeysuckle. He lowered himself onto a fallen log, its bark soft with age, and Copper collapsed beside him with a heavy sigh that seemed to come from somewhere deep in his chest.

"I know, buddy," Marcus said, unscrewing his water bottle. "We're not exactly setting any speed records today."

Copper's tail gave a single thump against the dirt.

Marcus poured water into his cupped palm, holding it out. Copper's tongue was warm and rough, lapping slowly. Some of the water escaped through Marcus's fingers, darkening the dusty ground. When Copper finished, he rested his graying muzzle on Marcus's knee, eyes already half-closed.

The pine grove stretched around them, shadows dappling the trail. Marcus had walked this path a thousand times—running ahead as a kid while Copper bounded after him, jogging it in middle school with Copper keeping pace, and lately, taking it slow, matching Copper's careful steps. The trees stood unchanged, indifferent to the passage of time in the way only trees could be.

Marcus ran his hand along Copper's spine, feeling each vertebra beneath the fur. The dog had lost weight this past year, his ribs more prominent, his hip bones sharp beneath Marcus's palm.

A breeze moved through the pines, and Marcus closed his eyes.

---

*The garage smelled like motor oil and sawdust. Marcus pressed himself into the corner behind his father's workbench, knees pulled to his chest, face buried in his arms. The black suit his mother had made him wear to the funeral was too hot, the collar too tight, but he couldn't make himself care enough to take off the jacket.*

*He didn't want to cry anymore. He'd cried all through the service, cried when people he barely knew hugged him too hard and said things that didn't mean anything. He was tired of crying. But here, alone, the tears came anyway—hot and angry and endless.*

*The garage door opened.*

*"Marcus?" His mother's voice, thin and exhausted. "Honey, are you in here?"*

*He held his breath, making himself smaller.*

*"I brought someone to meet you."*

*He heard her footsteps, then something else—the scrabble of tiny claws on concrete, a snuffling sound.*

*"His name is Copper," his mother said softly. "I thought... I thought maybe..."*

*She didn't finish. Marcus heard her crying, trying to muffle it. Then her footsteps retreated, and the door closed.*

*Marcus lifted his head.*

*A puppy sat three feet away, watching him. Golden-red fur, too-big paws, ears that flopped forward. The puppy tilted his head, studying Marcus with dark, serious eyes.*

*"Go away," Marcus whispered.*

*The puppy took a step closer.*

*"I said go away."*

*Another step. The puppy's tail wagged once, uncertain.*

*Marcus turned his face back to his knees. He heard the click of claws, felt warm breath on his ankle. Then a small, solid weight pressed against his leg.*

*"Stop it." His voice cracked. "Just leave me alone."*

*The puppy didn't leave. Instead, he climbed—clumsy and determined—into Marcus's lap, circling once before curling into a ball. He was warm and surprisingly heavy, his heartbeat fast against Marcus's stomach.*

*Marcus tried to push him away, but his hands wouldn't cooperate. They settled on the puppy's back instead, fingers sinking into impossibly soft fur.*

*The puppy sighed, a sound too big for such a small body, and rested his chin on Marcus's wrist.*

*They sat like that while the afternoon light shifted through the garage's high window, dust motes dancing in the golden beams. Marcus cried until he couldn't anymore, and the puppy stayed, solid and warm and stubbornly present.*

*When his mother came back an hour later, she found them both asleep—Marcus slumped against the wall, the puppy sprawled across his lap, one small paw resting on Marcus's chest.*

---

Marcus opened his eyes. The present-day Copper still had his muzzle on Marcus's knee, breathing slow and steady. His eyes were open now, watching Marcus with that same serious expression he'd had as a puppy.

"You picked me," Marcus said quietly. "Didn't you?"

Copper's tail moved once.

"Mom brought you home, but you... you decided I was yours."

The breeze picked up, carrying the sound of waves from somewhere beyond the trees. A jay called out, harsh and bright, and Copper's ear twitched but he didn't lift his head.

Marcus looked down at his dog—at the gray around his muzzle, the clouded left eye, the way his breathing seemed to take more effort than it used to. Ten years. A decade of mornings waking up to Copper's cold nose pressed against his face. Ten years of someone who never left, never gave up, never stopped choosing him.

"I don't know how to do this," Marcus whispered.

Copper shifted, pressing more of his weight against Marcus's leg, and somehow that simple gesture said everything that needed saying.

After a while, Marcus stood, his legs stiff from sitting. "Come on, buddy. Still got a ways to go."

Copper rose slowly, shaking himself once. Together, they stepped back onto the trail, moving deeper into the coastal pines, toward the sound of the ocean waiting beyond.

**Scene 3: As they navigate a rocky secti...**

**Scene 3: As they navigate a rocky section of trail**

The coastal path narrowed here, hemlock roots threading through granite like ancient veins. Marcus placed each foot carefully, testing the stability of loose stones before shifting his weight. Behind him, Copper's breathing came heavier, punctuated by the click of claws on rock.

"Easy, boy." Marcus stopped, turning back. "We can wait."

Copper's tail wagged once—acknowledgment without enthusiasm. The dog's chest rose and fell, his pink tongue lolling. A year ago, Copper would have bounded over these rocks without breaking stride.

Marcus found a flat boulder large enough for both of them and sat, patting the space beside him. Copper climbed up slowly, settling against Marcus's thigh with a grunt of relief. The ocean spread before them, endless and gray-green, whitecaps dancing in the afternoon wind.

The salt air triggered something—a scent memory, sweat and fear and schoolyard asphalt.

---

*Eighth grade. October.*

*The bell had rung fifteen minutes ago. Marcus stayed late, hiding in the art room until Mrs. Chen left, then slipping out the back exit. His backpack felt heavy with the weight of a failed math test he couldn't show his mother. Not yet. Not when she was barely holding it together herself, two years after Dad's death.*

*"Hey, Patterson."*

*Marcus's stomach dropped. He knew that voice—Tyler Brennan, a tenth-grader who'd been held back twice and wore it like a badge of honor.*

*Three of them blocked the path between the gym and the parking lot. Tyler in the middle, flanked by his shadows. Marcus couldn't remember their names. Didn't want to.*

*"Where you going in such a hurry?" Tyler stepped forward, all swagger and menace.*

*Marcus's throat tightened. "Home."*

*"Home to Mommy?" One of the others laughed. "Oh wait—you don't have a daddy to run to, do you?"*

*The words hit like fists. Marcus's hands clenched around his backpack straps.*

*"What was it again?" Tyler tilted his head, mock-thoughtful. "Heart attack? Your old man just dropped dead, right? Probably embarrassed to have such a wimpy kid."*

*Something hot and sharp rose in Marcus's chest. His vision blurred at the edges.*

*"Leave me alone."*

*"Or what?" Tyler shoved him. Not hard—just enough to make Marcus stumble back against the brick wall. "You gonna cry about it? Gonna go cry to your dead daddy?"*

*Marcus's hands shook. He wanted to swing, to fight back, but there were three of them and his body wouldn't move, frozen in that familiar paralysis of grief and rage and helplessness.*

*Then—a sound. Low and rolling, building from somewhere beyond the parking lot.*

*A growl.*

*Copper appeared around the corner of the gym like something out of a dream. Six years old then, in his prime, all muscle and fury. His lips pulled back from his teeth, and that growl Marcus had never heard before—never knew Copper possessed—seemed to vibrate through the asphalt itself.*

*"What the—" Tyler stumbled backward.*

*Copper advanced, hackles raised, every inch of his body radiating protective violence. He positioned himself between Marcus and the three boys, and the growl escalated into a bark that echoed off the brick walls.*

*"Crazy dog!" One of the shadows turned and ran. The other followed.*

*Tyler held his ground for three more seconds—just long enough to save face—then backed away, hands raised. "Whatever, Patterson. Your psycho dog can't protect you forever."*

*But Copper followed him, barking, until Tyler broke into a jog toward the parking lot.*

*Then silence.*

*Copper turned, trotted back to Marcus, and the transformation was instant—from warrior to companion. His tail wagged. He pressed his head against Marcus's leg, whining softly.*

*Marcus slid down the wall to sit on the ground, his whole body shaking. He buried his face in Copper's fur.*

*"How did you—" But it didn't matter how Copper had escaped the backyard, how he'd known where to find Marcus. He was here.*

*"Good boy," Marcus whispered. "Good boy."*

*And for the first time since his father's funeral, Marcus felt something shift inside his chest. Not the absence of fear—but the presence of something stronger. He wasn't alone. He wasn't helpless.*

*He had Copper.*

---

Present-day Marcus ran his hand along Copper's spine, feeling the knobs of vertebrae more prominent now beneath thinning fur. The dog's breathing had steadied, his eyes half-closed in the afternoon sun.

"You were such a badass that day," Marcus said softly. "I don't think I ever thanked you properly."

Copper's tail thumped twice against the rock.

Marcus remembered walking home that afternoon, Copper trotting beside him with the broken section of fence still attached to his collar. His mother had been furious about the escape, worried about the dog getting hit by a car. But Marcus had fixed the fence himself that weekend, and something else too—something inside himself that had been broken since his father died.

After that day, the bullies left him alone. Word spread: Patterson's dog was crazy protective. Don't mess with him.

But it was more than that. Marcus had started walking differently, standing straighter. Because he knew—really knew—that he wasn't facing the world alone. That fierce, loyal love had his back.

"You taught me I was worth protecting," Marcus said, his voice catching. "Did you know that? You made me feel like I mattered."

Copper lifted his head, brown eyes meeting Marcus's. For a moment, they just looked at each other—boy and dog, young man and old companion, two beings who'd saved each other in ways that couldn't be measured or explained.

Marcus leaned down and pressed his forehead to Copper's. "I've got you now, okay? However long this walk takes. I've got you."

The wind picked up, carrying the scent of salt and kelp. Below them, waves crashed against the rocks in their eternal rhythm.

"Ready?" Marcus asked.

Copper stood, stiff but steady, and started picking his way down the trail.

Marcus followed, his heart full of fierce, aching pride.

**Scene 4: Halfway to the cove, they reac...**

**Scene 4: Halfway to the cove, they reach the sun-warmed rock**

The granite boulder sat exactly where it always had, jutting from the hillside like a giant's thumb, its surface bleached pale by years of salt spray and sun. Marcus recognized it from fifty yards away—the way it caught the afternoon light, the twisted cypress that grew beside it, roots clinging to stone like arthritic fingers.

Copper had already stopped, his sides heaving with the effort of the climb. He looked up at Marcus with those clouded eyes, tongue lolling, and Marcus felt the familiar tightness in his chest.

"Yeah, buddy. I know."

They'd been walking for nearly two hours, and they'd barely covered a mile. Marcus tried not to think about the math, about how many rest stops it would take to reach Serpent's Cove at this pace. Instead, he focused on guiding Copper toward the rock, one slow step at a time.

The stone held the day's warmth like a battery. Marcus hoisted himself up first, then turned back to help Copper. It took three tries—Copper's back legs scrabbling uselessly against the granite, claws scratching for purchase—before Marcus managed to lift him the rest of the way. The dog weighed almost nothing now, all bone and loose skin beneath the copper-colored fur.

Copper collapsed immediately, flanks still working like a bellows. Marcus sat beside him, one hand resting on the dog's ribcage, feeling each labored breath.

From here, the ocean spread out below them in bands of color—turquoise shallows bleeding into deeper blue, then the dark navy of the distant channel. A line of pelicans glided past in formation, barely skimming the wave tops. The wind carried the sharp tang of kelp and brine, mixing with the sweeter scent of the wild roses that bloomed in the sheltered spots along the trail.

Marcus had sat on this exact rock last August. Same view, same wind, different everything.

Sarah had been wearing her yellow sundress, the one with the tiny white flowers. They'd been friends since freshman year, but that afternoon was the first time Marcus had really *looked* at her—the way the sunlight caught the black silk of her hair, the constellation of freckles across her nose that only appeared in summer, the careful way she moved around Copper, like she understood he was precious cargo.

They'd talked for hours, about nothing and everything. College applications. Her parents' expectations. The way grief felt like carrying a stone in your pocket, how some days you forgot it was there and other days it weighed a thousand pounds.

"My dad used to say that healing isn't about forgetting," Marcus had told her, surprising himself with the words. "It's about learning to carry it better."

Sarah had gone quiet then, watching the waves. When she finally spoke, her voice was soft. "Do you think he'd be proud of you?"

The question had hit him harder than he'd expected. "I don't know. I hope so."

That's when her hand had found his, fingers interlacing like they'd done it a thousand times before. Copper had shifted, resting his graying muzzle in Marcus's lap, and for the first time since his father's funeral, Marcus had felt something other than the weight of absence. He'd felt *present*. Connected. Like maybe the future didn't have to be just about surviving.

They'd kissed as the sun touched the horizon, Copper snoring softly between them, and Marcus had thought: *This. This is what Dad meant.*

His phone buzzed in his pocket, pulling him back to the present. Marcus fished it out, squinting against the glare.

**Sarah:** *How are you doing? Thinking about you both.*

Three dots appeared, disappeared, appeared again.

**Sarah:** *No pressure to respond. Just wanted you to know I'm here.*

Marcus stared at the screen, thumb hovering over the keyboard. What could he say? That he was sitting on their rock, watching Copper struggle to breathe, trying to memorize the way the sunlight turned his fur to molten copper? That he was terrified and grateful and heartbroken all at once?

He slipped the phone back into his pocket without responding.

Copper stirred, lifting his head with visible effort. His tail thumped once against the warm stone—a shadow of its former enthusiasm, but unmistakable. The dog's eyes, clouded as they were, fixed on Marcus's face with that same steady gaze that had anchored him through a decade of storms.

"You've been here for all of it, haven't you?" Marcus whispered, scratching behind Copper's ears. "Every single moment that mattered."

The funeral, when Marcus was too young to understand that gone meant forever. The garage, where Copper had found him sobbing into his father's old work jacket. The first day of middle school. The bullies behind the gym—Marcus could still remember the way Copper had planted himself between them, hackles raised, a growl rumbling from deep in his chest that said *not my boy, not ever*. 

Every birthday. Every bad dream. Every moment when the weight of his father's absence threatened to crush him, Copper had been there, solid and warm and utterly certain that Marcus was worth protecting.

And last summer, on this very rock, Copper had been there too—blessing the moment with his peaceful presence, making Marcus feel safe enough to open his heart again.

"You gave me that," Marcus said, his voice cracking. "You gave me Sarah. You gave me the strength to believe I could be okay."

Copper's tail thumped again, weaker this time.

The sun had shifted, casting longer shadows across the trail below. They'd need to move soon if they were going to reach the cove before dark. But for now, Marcus let himself stay in this moment—the warmth of the rock beneath them, the salt wind in his face, Copper's breathing gradually slowing to something less labored.

His phone buzzed again, but Marcus didn't check it. Instead, he looked out at the ocean, at the path ahead winding down toward the hidden cove, and felt something shift inside him. Not acceptance, not yet. But maybe the beginning of understanding.

Copper had already given him everything. The question wasn't how to avoid losing him—that was inevitable, written in every labored breath and clouded eye. The question was whether Marcus could be brave enough to give Copper this last gift: one perfect afternoon at the place where it all began, where a six-year-old boy and a copper-colored puppy had first learned to heal together.

"Okay, buddy," Marcus said softly, running his hand along Copper's spine. "Just a little further. We're almost there."

Copper lifted his head, ears pricking forward as if he understood. As if he'd been waiting for Marcus to be ready.

Together, they climbed down from the sun-warmed rock and continued toward the cove.

**Scene 5: As the trail descends toward S...**

**Scene 5: As the trail descends toward Serpent's Cove**

The path tilted sharply downward, transforming from packed earth to loose gravel and exposed root systems that had been carved by decades of rainfall. Marcus had navigated this descent hundreds of times—running full-tilt as a kid, racing Sarah down it last summer, once even attempting it on his skateboard before common sense prevailed halfway down.

Today, he took the first step and felt Copper hesitate behind him.

"Come on, boy. We're almost there."

Copper's front paw extended, testing the slope. His back leg trembled with the effort of holding his weight on the incline.

Marcus turned back, crouching. "It's okay. Just take it slow."

But slow wasn't the problem. Copper managed three careful steps before his hind legs buckled. He didn't yelp—he never did—but Marcus heard the scramble of nails against stone, saw the brief flash of confusion in those clouded eyes.

"Whoa, whoa—I've got you." Marcus lunged forward, catching Copper's chest before he could slide. Seventy pounds of dog sagged against him, panting hard.

The trail stretched below them, maybe fifty yards of steep descent before it leveled out at the cove. Fifty yards that might as well have been fifty miles.

Marcus tried to ease Copper back onto his feet, but the dog's legs shook violently now, muscles exhausted from the hours-long journey. When Marcus let go, Copper immediately sat, then lay down completely, his sides heaving.

"No, no, no—come on, Copper. We're so close." Marcus's voice cracked. "You can do this. You've done it a thousand times."

Copper's tail thumped once against the dirt. An apology. A surrender.

The ocean wind carried the scent of salt and kelp up the slope, and somewhere below, Marcus could hear the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocky beach. Serpent's Cove was right there, just past this last obstacle. The place where Copper had first discovered the tide pools, where Marcus's dad had taught him to skip stones, where every summer of his childhood had officially begun.

The place Copper couldn't reach anymore.

Marcus sank down beside his dog, one hand buried in the thick fur at Copper's neck. His throat felt tight. "You don't want to be here, do you? You never did."

Copper's brown eyes found his, patient and knowing.

"This whole thing—" Marcus's voice broke. "This was for me. You'd be home right now, sleeping on your bed, if I hadn't—" He couldn't finish.

The truth settled over him like the coastal fog that rolled in each evening: Copper hadn't needed this journey. Marcus had. He'd dragged his elderly, arthritic dog on a three-hour hike because he couldn't face what was coming. Because he'd convinced himself that if they could just make it back to Serpent's Cove one more time, somehow everything would be like it used to be.

But nothing was like it used to be.

Marcus looked down at the cove, then back at Copper. His dog wasn't watching the ocean or the trail ahead. Copper was watching him, the way he'd been watching Marcus for ten years. Waiting. Trusting. Ready to follow wherever Marcus led, even when it hurt.

"I'm sorry," Marcus whispered.

He shifted position, working his arms under Copper's body—one beneath the chest, one supporting the hindquarters. Copper was heavy, heavier than Marcus expected, but he managed to stand, cradling his dog against his chest.

"Okay," he said, his voice steadier now. "Okay. Let's finish this."

The first step down the slope nearly sent them both tumbling. Marcus's sneakers slid on loose gravel, and he had to throw his weight backward to keep his balance. Copper remained still in his arms, trusting completely.

Marcus took another step. Then another. His shoulders screamed. His legs burned. Sweat dripped into his eyes despite the cool breeze coming off the ocean. He had to stop twice, setting Copper down gently on wider sections of trail to rest his arms, but each time he picked his dog back up and continued.

The descent that usually took two minutes stretched into fifteen.

When Marcus's feet finally hit the level sand of Serpent's Cove, his arms were shaking so badly he could barely lower Copper to the ground. He collapsed beside his dog, gasping, his muscles turned to water.

They'd made it.

But as Marcus lay there catching his breath, watching Copper's labored breathing match his own, he understood with crystalline clarity: making it here didn't change anything. It didn't turn back time. It didn't make Copper young again.

It just meant they'd have to make the climb back up.

**Scene 6: They finally reach Serpent's C...**

**Scene 6: They finally reach Serpent's Cove**

The trail opened onto the crescent of sand just as the sun reached its apex, flooding Serpent's Cove with light that turned the water into liquid silver. Marcus paused at the edge of the beach, his hand resting on Copper's warm head, both of them breathing hard from the final descent.

"We made it, buddy," he whispered.

Copper's tail moved—not the enthusiastic wag of his youth, but a slow, deliberate acknowledgment. His clouded eyes tracked toward the water as if he remembered this place, as if some part of him had been waiting to return.

The sand was harder to cross than the trail had been. Copper's paws sank with each step, his legs trembling with the effort. Marcus knelt beside him, one hand under his chest for support, matching his pace to Copper's labored breathing. They moved together, step by careful step, leaving a wavering trail of paw prints and sneaker treads behind them.

"Almost there. Just a little further."

The tide was low, revealing the dark rocks where Marcus had stood ten years ago, his mother's hand on his shoulder, watching his father's ashes drift out with the current. He'd been six years old and hadn't understood why everyone was crying, why his dad wasn't coming home, why the ocean had to take even this last piece of him away.

But Copper had been there. Four months old, all oversized paws and floppy ears, refusing to leave Marcus's side even when the waves scared him.

The water reached them, cold foam rushing over Marcus's shoes and Copper's paws. Copper lifted his head, nostrils flaring as he breathed in the salt air. For a moment, Marcus saw a flash of the dog he'd been—the one who'd bounded through these waves, who'd retrieved sticks until his legs gave out, who'd shaken water all over Marcus and Sarah last summer while they laughed.

Copper took another step forward, then another, until the water reached his chest. He stood there, solid despite the trembling in his legs, facing the horizon.

Marcus sat down hard in the wet sand, not caring about the cold seeping through his jeans. His throat burned. His eyes stung from more than the wind.

"You've always been braver than me," he said, his voice breaking.

A wave rolled in, gentle, lifting Copper slightly before settling him back down. The dog's breathing had evened out, his expression peaceful in a way Marcus hadn't seen in months. No pain creasing his muzzle. No confusion clouding his eyes. Just Copper, present and whole, exactly where he needed to be.

And Marcus understood.

All this time, he'd been holding on because he couldn't imagine life without Copper. Because losing him felt like losing his father all over again, like losing the only constant he'd ever had. He'd convinced himself that keeping Copper alive was love, that fighting for every extra day was what loyalty looked like.

But Copper wasn't fighting anymore. He'd made this walk for Marcus, given everything he had left to reach this place, because that's what Copper did—he showed up, even when it cost him everything.

The realization settled over Marcus like the incoming tide, cold and undeniable: Copper had already given him the gift. Not just the memories, not just the companionship through the worst years of his life. Copper had given him the strength to survive his father's death, the courage to face bullies and heartbreak and all the small terrors of growing up. Copper had taught him what love looked like—constant, patient, unconditional.

And now Copper was teaching him the hardest lesson of all.

Love meant letting go.

Marcus pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes, shoulders shaking. A sob tore from his chest, then another, all the grief he'd been holding back for months pouring out of him. He cried for his father, for the childhood that had ended too soon, for the dog who'd saved him in every way that mattered.

When he finally looked up, Copper had turned toward him. The dog took slow, careful steps back through the water until he stood in front of Marcus, then lowered himself to the sand with a soft grunt. He rested his graying muzzle on Marcus's knee.

Marcus wrapped his arms around Copper's neck, buried his face in damp fur that smelled like salt and sunshine and home.

"Thank you," he whispered. "For everything. For being there when no one else could. For making me stronger. For showing me how to be brave."

Copper's tail thumped once against the sand.

Marcus pulled back, cupping Copper's face in both hands, memorizing every detail—the white around his muzzle, the warmth in his brown eyes, the way his ears perked slightly at Marcus's voice even now.

"It's okay," Marcus said, and this time he meant it. "You can rest now. I'm going to be okay."

The truth of it resonated in his chest, solid and real despite the pain. He would be okay. Not because the grief would disappear, but because Copper had already given him everything he needed to carry it.

They sat together at the water's edge as the sun climbed higher, boy and dog, exactly as they'd been for ten years. The waves rolled in and out, patient and eternal, carrying whispers of all the goodbyes that had come before and all the ones still to come.

When Marcus finally stood, his legs stiff from sitting, Copper rose with him. They turned together, facing the long walk back, and Marcus knew with quiet certainty what he had to do.

Not today. But soon.

For now, they had the journey home, and each other, and the warm sun on their shoulders. For now, that was enough.
