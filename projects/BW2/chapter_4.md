## Chapter 4: Barcelona Nights

**Scene 1: Max arrives at the converted p...**

**Scene 1: Max arrives at the converted palace venue**

The Uber deposited Max at the base of a sweeping marble staircase that climbed toward what had once been the residence of Catalan nobility. Now it served a different aristocracy—one measured in market caps and unicorn valuations rather than bloodlines. The Palau de Mar rose above him, its honey-colored stone catching the amber light of early evening, the Mediterranean stretching beyond it like hammered bronze.

Max adjusted his cufflinks—Swiss, expensive, the kind of detail that mattered in circles like these—and began his ascent. Each step brought him closer to the murmur of voices and the soft strains of a string quartet drifting through the arched entrance. Security personnel in dark suits flanked the doorway, their earpieces barely visible, their eyes performing the same calculus Max had perfected: threat assessment, pattern recognition, anomaly detection.

He handed over his invitation to a woman with a tablet, her smile professionally warm. "Mr. Monroe. Welcome to the Global Innovation Summit. Please proceed to the grand foyer."

Inside, the palace had been gutted and reimagined as a temple to modernity wrapped in historical grandeur. Soaring ceilings with restored frescoes looked down on installations of holographic displays and interactive art pieces that responded to movement. Wait staff in crisp white shirts navigated between clusters of guests bearing trays of champagne and what Max assumed were molecular gastronomy interpretations of tapas.

He accepted a glass of cava and moved deeper into the space, his eyes cataloging faces, postures, the subtle hierarchies revealed in who stood at the center of conversational circles and who orbited at the edges. Tech executives in deliberately casual blazers over designer t-shirts. Venture capitalists who'd learned to dress like the founders they funded. Consultants—the real question marks—in tailored suits that could mean anything from McKinsey to something far less legitimate.

The small communications device in his ear came to life with a barely audible click.

"Lovely evening for it." His handler's voice was crisp, gender-neutral, identified in his mind only as Control.

Max turned toward one of the tall windows overlooking the terrace, pretending to admire the view while he subvocalized his response. "Venue's a fortress. Multiple exit points, but all monitored."

"As expected. Remember, Monroe—identification before elimination. We need to know who's contracting these hits. The assassin is our only lead."

"Copy that." Max took a sip of cava, the bubbles sharp on his tongue. "Any updates on potential targets tonight?"

"Three executives on your list are confirmed attendance. Yuki Tanaka from Nexus Dynamics, Richard Pemberton from Helix Capital, and Dr. Sarah Chen from BioSynth. If the pattern holds, one of them could be next."

Max's jaw tightened imperceptibly. "Time frame?"

"Unknown. The previous eliminations occurred within seventy-two hours of summit-type events. Stay sharp."

The connection went silent.

Max moved through the crowd with practiced ease, his cover story—independent consultant specializing in market disruption analysis—providing natural entry points to conversations. He shook hands with a founder who'd sold his AI startup for eight hundred million and now spent his time advising others on how to replicate his success. He nodded along as a hedge fund manager explained her thesis on quantum computing investments.

All the while, his real attention operated on a different frequency. He noted the woman in the emerald dress who seemed to touch each person she spoke with—hand on forearm, fingers briefly on shoulder—a tactile mapper of connections. The man with silver temples who never held his champagne glass with his right hand, keeping it free. The consultant who'd positioned himself with clear sightlines to every entrance.

Any of them could be the one he was hunting.

Through the crowd, Max caught sight of the terrace beyond the foyer, where the last light of sunset painted the sea in shades of coral and violet. More guests clustered there, silhouetted against the dying light. That's where the real players would be, he knew—the ones confident enough to turn their backs on the spectacle inside.

He began moving in that direction when a shift in the crowd's energy made him pause. Heads turning. Conversations faltering and resuming. Someone important had arrived.

Max positioned himself near a column, glass raised to his lips, and waited to see who commanded that kind of gravity.

The answer would come soon enough.

**Scene 2: Max mingles through the cockta...**

**Scene 2: Max mingles through the cocktail reception**

The converted palace's main reception hall stretched before Max like a stage set designed to overwhelm. Floor-to-ceiling windows framed the Mediterranean's darkening waters, where yacht lights began to pierce the dusk like scattered diamonds. Crystal chandeliers cast prismatic light across marble floors so polished they reflected the crowd in ghostly doubles. The air carried competing scents—expensive perfume, aged whiskey, and the salt breeze that slipped through open terrace doors.

Max accepted a glass of champagne from a passing server, using the motion to scan the room. Approximately two hundred guests, he estimated. Seventy percent male. Average age forty-five. The usual tech conference demographics, but with harder edges. These weren't idealistic startup founders in hoodies. These were the apex predators—the ones who'd survived long enough to become either very wealthy or very dangerous. Often both.

"Quite the spectacle, isn't it?" A man materialized at Max's elbow, American accent with East Coast polish. Mid-fifties, silver hair, custom suit that probably cost more than most people's monthly rent. His name tag read "David Kellerman—Kellerman Ventures."

"Certainly makes an impression," Max replied, settling into his cover persona. "Though I imagine that's the point. Nothing says 'innovation' quite like eighteenth-century architecture."

Kellerman laughed, the practiced sound of someone who networked for a living. "You must be new to the Summit. First year?"

"First year at this particular event. Max Monroe, Meridian Capital." Max extended his hand, noting the firmness of Kellerman's grip—confident but not aggressive. No wedding ring, though there was a tan line where one used to be. Recent divorce, possibly.

"Ah, Meridian. You're the ones who got in early on that quantum computing play." Kellerman's eyes sharpened with interest. "Smart move. Though I heard you pulled out of the biotech sector entirely last quarter."

Max had memorized Meridian's portfolio during the flight from Dublin. "We're being selective. The regulatory environment's getting complicated."

"Complicated." Kellerman's smile didn't reach his eyes. "That's one word for it. Especially after what happened to Chen and Volkov."

There it was. Max kept his expression mildly curious. "Terrible business. Did you know them?"

"Chen, yes. Brilliant woman. Difficult, but brilliant." Kellerman's gaze drifted across the room. "We almost did a deal together two years ago. She pulled out at the last minute. Said something felt wrong about the terms." He paused, swirling his whiskey. "She had good instincts."

"Until recently."

Kellerman's eyes snapped back to Max. For a moment, something cold flickered there—calculation or fear, Max couldn't quite tell. Then the networking smile returned. "Indeed. Well, enjoy the Summit, Monroe. Word of advice? The real conversations happen on the terrace after midnight. That's where the actual deals get made."

He drifted away into the crowd, leaving Max to process. Kellerman knew something, or suspected something. The way he'd mentioned Chen's instincts, the emphasis on "wrong about the terms." Was he warning Max, or fishing for information?

Max moved deeper into the reception, letting conversations wash over him. He positioned himself near a cluster of executives from various biotech firms, nursing his champagne while appearing absorbed in his phone. The trick was to become furniture—present but unremarkable.

"—can't believe they're still holding this thing," a woman was saying, her French accent clipping the words. "After two murders? It's obscene."

"It's business," her companion replied, German precision in his English. "The Summit represents billions in potential deals. You think they'd cancel because of some corporate espionage gone wrong?"

"Is that what we're calling it now? Espionage?"

The German lowered his voice. "What else? Chen and Volkov both had access to cutting-edge research. Military applications. Someone wanted what they knew."

Max filed that away. The official line was still treating the deaths as isolated incidents, possibly accidents. But the rumor mill knew better.

He moved on, cataloging faces and interactions. Near the terrace doors, a cluster of Chinese executives spoke in Mandarin, their body language tense. Max's Mandarin was serviceable enough to catch fragments—something about "increased security protocols" and "vetting all new partnerships." They were scared.

A burst of laughter drew his attention to the room's center, where a tall man in an impeccably tailored navy suit held court. Max recognized him from the briefing materials: James Whitmore, CEO of Helix Pharmaceuticals. One of the Summit's headline speakers. Whitmore had the easy charisma of someone who'd never been told no, gesturing expansively as he recounted some anecdote. His audience—three men and two women, all hanging on his words—laughed on cue.

But there was something off about Whitmore's performance. His smile was too bright, his gestures too broad. And his eyes kept flicking toward the exits, tracking movement. Max had seen that behavior before—in people who knew they were being hunted.

"Quite the peacock, isn't he?"

Max turned to find a woman beside him, late thirties, dark hair pulled back in a severe bun. Her name tag identified her as "Dr. Sarah Chen—BioFuture Dynamics." No relation to the murdered Amanda Chen, according to Max's research, but the coincidence must be uncomfortable.

"He certainly commands attention," Max agreed.

"James always does. Though I notice he's traveling with three bodyguards now." She nodded subtly toward the edges of the room, where Max had already identified the security personnel. "That's new. Last year he could barely be bothered with one."

"Can you blame him? Given recent events."

Dr. Chen's expression hardened. "Amanda Chen was my mentor. We published together. So no, I don't blame anyone for being careful." She studied Max with sudden intensity. "You're new. Meridian Capital?"

"That's right."

"What's your interest here? The Summit's usually more focused on established players, not new money looking for opportunities."

There was an edge to her voice—suspicion or grief, Max couldn't tell. He kept his tone neutral. "We're exploring partnerships in the AI-biotech intersection. Your firm's work on protein folding algorithms is particularly interesting."

"Is it." Not a question. She took a long drink from her wine glass, her hand trembling slightly. "Everyone's so interested in everyone else's work these days. Interested enough to kill for it, apparently."

Before Max could respond, a commotion near the entrance drew their attention. The crowd parted slightly, and Max caught his first glimpse of her.

She moved through the room like a blade through water—effortless, purposeful, leaving ripples in her wake. Late twenties or early thirties, dark hair cascading past her shoulders, wearing a black dress that managed to be both elegant and understated. But it was her bearing that caught Max's attention. The way she scanned the room, the slight pause as she cataloged faces and positions. Professional awareness disguised as casual interest.

And on her dress, just above her heart, a white orchid pin caught the chandelier light.

"That's Mariana Alvidrez," Dr. Chen said quietly. "Vershinsky's pet consultant. Beautiful, brilliant, and absolutely ruthless in negotiations. She's closed three major deals for him this year alone."

Max watched as Mariana accepted a glass of champagne from a server without looking at him, her attention fixed on someone across the room. "She seems very focused."

"She's a hunter. We're all just prey." Dr. Chen's voice had gone flat. "If you'll excuse me, I need some air."

She walked away quickly, leaving Max alone with his observations. Mariana had moved to engage with Whitmore's group, and Max watched as the CEO's demeanor shifted—the performative confidence giving way to something more genuine. Or perhaps more guarded. She said something that made him laugh, but his eyes remained wary.

Max began moving in their direction, plotting an intercept course, when his phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number: *Terrace. Five minutes. Come alone.*

He glanced up. Across the room, David Kellerman caught his eye and gave the slightest nod before disappearing through the terrace doors.

The champagne suddenly tasted sour in Max's mouth. Either Kellerman had information to share, or Max was being led into a trap. Possibly both.

He checked his watch, then looked back toward Mariana. She was laughing at something Whitmore said,

**Scene 3: Max is introduced to Mariana A...**

**Scene 3: Max is introduced to Mariana Alvidrez**

The terrace bar perched on the palace's western edge like an eagle's nest, offering an unobstructed view of the Mediterranean as it transformed from sapphire to molten gold. Max stood with his back to the stone balustrade, a glass of Albariño sweating in his hand, watching the crowd flow and eddy like a living organism. The golden hour light painted everything in honey and amber, softening the hard edges of ambition that defined this gathering.

"Max Monroe, isn't it?" 

The voice belonged to Gerald Fiske, a venture capitalist from London whom Max had met earlier near the canapé station. Fiske had the ruddy complexion of someone who enjoyed his wine a bit too much and the easy confidence of inherited wealth.

"Guilty," Max said, turning with a practiced smile.

"Thought so. Listen, there's someone I think you should meet." Fiske gestured to his left, where a woman stood silhouetted against the dying sun. "Given your work in market positioning, you two might find common ground."

As she stepped forward, the light shifted, and Max felt something tighten in his chest—not attraction, though she was undeniably striking, but recognition of a kindred predator.

She was perhaps thirty-five, with dark hair pulled back in a style that was elegant without trying to be, revealing a face of sharp angles and intelligent eyes the color of aged whiskey. Her dress was midnight blue, simple and expensive, and on her left shoulder she wore a white orchid pin that caught the fading sunlight.

"Mariana Alvidrez," she said, extending her hand. Her accent carried the musical lilt of educated Spanish, but something else underneath—Eastern European, perhaps. "Gerald tells me you're the man who makes companies irresistible."

Her handshake was firm, brief, professional. Her skin was cool despite the evening warmth.

"I help them tell their story," Max said. "Though 'irresistible' might be overselling it."

"Modesty in Barcelona?" She smiled, and it almost reached her eyes. "How refreshing."

Fiske, sensing his role was complete, excused himself with a jovial wave, leaving them alone at the edge of the terrace. A waiter glided past with a tray of champagne flutes. Mariana took one without looking, the gesture so smooth it seemed choreographed.

"Gerald mentioned you work with Mikhail Vershinsky," Max said, keeping his tone light, conversational. He watched her face for any microexpression, any tell.

"I consult for several of his portfolio companies," she replied. "Strategic positioning, competitive analysis, market entry strategies." She took a sip of champagne. "The usual corporate theater."

"Theater. That's an interesting way to describe it."

"Isn't it, though?" Her eyes met his, and for a moment, the polite veneer slipped, revealing something harder underneath. "We all play our parts. The visionary CEO. The disruptive innovator. The trusted advisor." She paused. "The communications specialist who shapes narratives."

The air between them crackled with unspoken questions. Max could feel her assessing him, cataloging details—the quality of his watch, the way he stood, the micro-pause before he responded. He was doing the same to her, noting the slight callus on her right index finger, the way her eyes tracked movement in her peripheral vision, the controlled precision of every gesture.

"You make it sound cynical," Max said.

"Not cynical. Pragmatic." She turned to face the sea, and the breeze caught a strand of her hair, pulling it loose. She didn't fix it. "In our world, appearance and reality are often the same thing. If everyone believes a company is revolutionary, it becomes revolutionary. Truth is just consensus with better marketing."

"And which are you?" Max asked. "Appearance or reality?"

She laughed—a genuine sound that surprised him. "Direct. I like that." She turned back to him, and now her smile was different, sharper. "I'm whichever serves my clients best."

"Vershinsky is lucky to have you."

"Mikhail doesn't believe in luck. He believes in leverage." She tilted her head slightly, studying him. "What do you believe in, Mr. Monroe?"

The question hung between them like a blade. Max took a slow sip of his wine, using the moment to consider his response. In his peripheral vision, he saw her fingers rest lightly on the stem of her champagne flute—relaxed, but ready.

"I believe everyone has a story they want to tell," he said finally. "And everyone has a story they want to hide."

"And your job is to decide which one the world sees."

"Something like that."

She nodded slowly, as if he'd confirmed something she'd suspected. Behind them, someone laughed too loudly, and a string quartet began playing Vivaldi somewhere in the palace interior. The sun was nearly gone now, painting the sky in shades of coral and violet.

"I've seen your work," Mariana said. "The Nexus campaign last year. Very clever, the way you repositioned their data breach as a security enhancement opportunity."

Max felt a cold finger trace down his spine. The Nexus campaign wasn't public knowledge—it had been handled quietly, discreetly, through back channels. The fact that she knew about it meant she'd been digging, or someone had been feeding her information.

"I'm flattered you're familiar with my portfolio," he said carefully.

"I make it my business to know who shapes the narrative." Her eyes never left his face. "In this world, information is currency. And you, Mr. Monroe, seem to deal in very valuable information."

"As do you, apparently."

"Touché."

They stood in silence for a moment, the weight of unspoken suspicions settling between them like fog. Max could feel the game shifting, the careful dance becoming something more dangerous. She knew too much, or she was bluffing brilliantly—either way, she was far more than a simple consultant.

"Will you be attending the full summit?" Mariana asked, her tone returning to professional courtesy.

"Through the weekend, yes."

"Then I'm sure we'll see each other again." She finished her champagne and set the empty flute on a passing waiter's tray with practiced ease. "Barcelona is a small city, especially for people in our circles."

"I look forward to it."

"Do you?" She smiled again, and this time it was almost genuine. "How optimistic."

She extended her hand once more, and as Max took it, he felt her thumb brush briefly against his pulse point—checking his heart rate, perhaps, or simply reminding him that she was paying attention to everything.

"Enjoy the sunset, Mr. Monroe," she said. "They're particularly beautiful in Barcelona. Though they never last as long as you'd like."

Then she was gone, moving through the crowd with the fluid grace of someone who knew exactly where she was going and who she needed to see. Max watched her pause to speak with a German tech executive, saw the way she touched the man's arm, laughed at something he said, all while her eyes continued to scan the room.

Cataloging, Max thought. She's cataloging all of them.

He turned back to the Mediterranean, now dark as ink beneath a sky streaked with dying light. His reflection stared back at him from the terrace windows, and for just a moment, he saw himself as she must have seen him—another player in the game, another piece on the board.

The white orchid pin flashed in his mind, but he pushed the thought away. Coincidence. It had to be.

Behind him, the party continued its elegant dance of power and influence. And somewhere in that crowd, a woman named Mariana Alvidrez was hunting for something, just as he was.

The question was whether they were hunting the same thing—or each other.

**Scene 4: Max and Mariana continue their...**

**Scene 4: Max and Mariana continue their conversation**

The terrace narrowed at its eastern edge, where ancient stone met modern glass in an architectural compromise that somehow worked. Max followed Mariana to this quieter corner, away from the clusters of tech executives and their practiced laughter. The Mediterranean stretched before them, darkening from sapphire to indigo as twilight descended over Barcelona.

"You're not like the others," Mariana said, leaning against the balustrade. The dying light caught the angles of her face, all sharp intelligence and careful composure. "Most consultants here are either selling something or desperately trying to appear like they're not."

Max smiled, keeping his posture relaxed despite the heightened awareness thrumming through his nervous system. "And which category do I fall into?"

"Neither. That's what makes you interesting." She tilted her head slightly, studying him. "You observe more than you speak. That's unusual in this industry."

"Maybe I'm just a good listener."

"Or maybe you're cataloging everyone here, just like I am."

The admission surprised him—too direct, too honest. Unless it was meant to disarm. Max took a sip of his champagne, letting the silence stretch between them while he recalibrated. Below, the city's lights began their nightly awakening, a constellation of human ambition spreading across the Catalan landscape.

"You work for Vershinsky," he said finally. Not a question.

"I consult for several clients. Mikhail is one of them." She turned to face the sea, her profile a study in controlled elegance. "He values discretion and insight. Two qualities that seem to be vanishing from the modern tech landscape."

"Along with ethics and accountability."

She laughed—a genuine sound that seemed to catch her off guard. "You really aren't like the others. Most people here worship at the altar of disruption, consequences be damned."

"And you don't?"

"I'm pragmatic." Mariana's fingers traced the stone balustrade, a unconscious gesture that revealed more than her words. "Technology is neither good nor evil. It's a tool. But the people wielding it..." She paused, choosing her words carefully. "They're often both."

Max moved closer, close enough to catch her scent—something subtle and expensive, with notes of jasmine and cedar. Close enough to notice the delicate pin on her dress, a perfect white orchid rendered in what looked like ivory or bone. The symbol from the intelligence reports. His pulse quickened, but he kept his expression neutral.

"Interesting pin," he said casually.

Her hand moved to it instinctively, protective. "A gift. From someone who appreciated my work."

"It suits you. Orchids are resilient flowers. Beautiful, but with hidden depths."

"And thorns, if you're not careful." Her dark eyes met his, and for a moment, something passed between them—recognition, perhaps, or warning. "What brings you to Barcelona, Mr. Monroe? Really?"

The question hung in the air like a blade. Max could feel the weight of her attention, the way she seemed to see past his carefully constructed facade. This was no ordinary consultant. Every instinct he'd honed over years in the field screamed danger, but something else stirred beneath the professional wariness—an attraction he couldn't quite suppress.

"The same thing that brings everyone here," he replied. "Opportunity. Connection. Understanding the landscape before making a move."

"And have you? Understood the landscape?"

"I'm beginning to."

A warm breeze rolled in from the sea, carrying the salt-and-stone smell of the ancient city. Somewhere behind them, a string quartet began playing, the music drifting through the open doors of the palace. Mariana's expression softened slightly, though her guard never fully lowered.

"There's a smaller gathering tomorrow night," she said. "More intimate. Fewer pretenses. Vershinsky is hosting at his villa in Sitges." She paused, as if weighing a decision. "You should come."

"Is that an invitation or a test?"

"Does it matter?"

Max smiled, though his mind raced through the implications. An invitation to Vershinsky's inner circle—exactly what he needed. But from her? A woman who might be the very person he was hunting? The irony wasn't lost on him.

"I suppose it doesn't," he said. "What time?"

"Nine. I'll have a car sent to your hotel." She pushed off from the balustrade, preparing to leave. "But Mr. Monroe? A word of advice."

"I'm listening."

"In this world, the most dangerous people are the ones who seem the most harmless. Remember that."

She walked away, her heels clicking against the stone terrace with metronomic precision. Max watched her disappear into the crowd, his reflection ghosting across the darkened glass doors. The white orchid pin had been unmistakable. The question was whether she'd worn it as a calling card or a challenge.

Behind him, a waiter appeared with fresh champagne. Max took a glass absently, his thoughts already moving ahead to tomorrow night. He'd been invited into the spider's web, willingly or not. Now he just had to survive long enough to determine who was the spider and who was the prey.

The city lights below pulsed and glittered, indifferent to the games being played in the heights above. Max pulled out his phone and typed a brief, encrypted message to Langley: *Contact made. Orchid confirmed. Proceeding to next phase.*

He hit send and returned to the party, his smile fixed and his senses alert. Somewhere in this glittering crowd of innovators and opportunists, a killer walked among them. And Max had just accepted an invitation to get closer.

The night was far from over.

**Scene 5: As the evening progresses, Max...**

As the evening progresses, Max positions himself near one of the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Mediterranean, nursing a glass of Rioja he has no intention of finishing. The ballroom has transformed from cocktail reception to seated dinner, though half the guests remain standing, circulating like sharks in evening wear. Crystal chandeliers cast warm light across the marble floors, and the scent of seared tuna and truffle oil drifts from the kitchen.

From this vantage point, he has a clear view of Mariana Alvidrez.

She moves through the crowd with the fluidity of someone who has mapped every exit, every sightline, every cluster of conversation. Max recognizes it because it's exactly what he did when he first arrived. But where his reconnaissance was methodical—a mental grid he filled in systematically—hers appears effortless, almost organic. She laughs at something a German venture capitalist says, her hand briefly touching his forearm, and Max sees the man's posture shift, opening toward her like a flower toward sunlight.

*She's good.*

Too good for a management consultant.

Max takes a calculated sip of wine, using the movement to mask his attention. Mariana has moved on to her second target of the evening: Chen Wei, CEO of a Shenzhen-based semiconductor firm that's been making aggressive moves into AI chip manufacturing. Chen is on Max's list—third tier, but rising. The kind of executive whose death would send ripples through supply chains across three continents.

Mariana says something that makes Chen laugh, a genuine bark of amusement that turns heads. She's positioned herself with her back to the window, forcing Chen to face the light, to squint slightly. An interrogator's trick. Max feels a cold thread of recognition wind through his chest.

He watches her eyes. They never stop moving, even as she maintains perfect eye contact with Chen. She's cataloging the security detail standing ten feet behind the CEO—two men in dark suits trying to look casual and failing. She notes the way Chen checks his phone compulsively, the slight tremor in his left hand that suggests either too much caffeine or a medical condition. She's reading him the way Max reads a dossier.

"Quite something, isn't she?"

Max turns to find Viktor Andersen, a Norwegian tech investor he'd spoken with earlier, standing beside him with a knowing smile.

"Impressive network," Max says neutrally.

"Mariana? She's Vershinsky's secret weapon. I've seen her talk three different CEOs out of hostile takeovers in a single evening." Viktor swirls his champagne. "Some say she has kompromat on half the people in this room. Others say she's just that persuasive."

"What do you say?"

Viktor's smile doesn't reach his eyes. "I say I'm very careful what I tell her."

He drifts away, leaving Max with that thought hanging in the air like smoke.

Mariana has moved on again. This time to James Burkhardt, American, founder of a cybersecurity firm that contracts with the Pentagon. Burkhardt is first tier on Max's list—high value, high profile, the kind of target that would make international headlines. He's also notably paranoid, traveling with a four-man security team and a personal food taster.

Max edges closer, using a cluster of French executives as cover. He's close enough now to hear fragments of conversation.

"...the problem with most security protocols," Mariana is saying, "is they focus on external threats while ignoring internal vulnerabilities."

Burkhardt leans in, interested. "You're talking about insider threats?"

"I'm talking about human nature." Her smile is warm, disarming. "We build walls, but we always leave doors. For convenience. For trust. For the illusion of normalcy."

Max feels his pulse quicken. It's the kind of thing an operative would say—probing for weaknesses, identifying access points. Or it's the kind of thing a very good consultant would say, the kind who understands that security is ultimately about psychology.

He can't tell which.

Mariana glances at her watch—a vintage Cartier, he notes, expensive but not ostentatious—and excuses herself from Burkhardt with a grace that suggests the conversation was always going to end at exactly this moment. She's planned it down to the minute.

As she turns, her eyes sweep the room and lock onto Max's for a fraction of a second. There's no surprise in her expression, no indication she's caught him watching. Just a flicker of acknowledgment, maybe amusement.

Then she's moving toward the terrace doors, stepping out into the Barcelona night.

Max counts to fifteen, watching to see if anyone follows her. No one does. Burkhardt rejoins his security team. Chen Wei has been cornered by a group of investors. The ballroom continues its elegant dance of power and influence.

He sets down his wine glass and follows.

The terrace is cooler than the ballroom, the Mediterranean breeze carrying the salt-sharp scent of the sea. Mariana stands at the railing, her back to him, the white orchid pin on her dress catching the moonlight. For a moment, she's perfectly still—not the stillness of relaxation, but of complete awareness.

"You're very good at watching," she says without turning around. Her English carries the faintest trace of a Spanish accent, musical and precise. "But you should know—I'm better at being watched."

Max approaches slowly, stopping a respectful distance away. "Occupational hazard. I spend my days analyzing patterns."

"So do I." She turns to face him, and in the moonlight her features are sharper, more defined. Less consultant, more predator. "The question is, Mr. Monroe—what patterns have you identified tonight?"

The Mediterranean stretches out behind her, dark and infinite. Somewhere in the ballroom, a string quartet begins to play. Max feels the weight of his concealed weapon against his ribs, a reminder of exactly how dangerous this conversation might be.

"I've identified," he says carefully, "that you're someone who pays very close attention to detail."

"And that concerns you?"

"It interests me."

Her smile is genuine this time, reaching her eyes. "Good. Because I find you interesting too." She pauses, and the pause feels weighted with meaning. "Tell me, do you believe in coincidences, Mr. Monroe?"

"In my experience, coincidences are usually just patterns we haven't recognized yet."

"Exactly." She touches the orchid pin on her dress, a casual gesture that sends ice through Max's veins. "I'll see you at tomorrow's sessions. I think we have much more to discuss."

She walks past him, close enough that he catches her perfume—jasmine and something darker, more complex. Then she's gone, the terrace doors closing softly behind her.

Max stands alone in the Barcelona night, the pieces of the puzzle rearranging themselves in his mind. Three high-value targets, all engaged in conversation. Perfect positioning, perfect timing, perfect tradecraft. And that orchid pin, white as bone, identical to the one found at the Paris crime scene.

His phone vibrates. A text from Langley, encrypted: *URGENT: New intel suggests target strike imminent. Summit attendees in danger. Recommend immediate action.*

Max looks back through the glass doors at the glittering crowd, at the executives laughing and networking and making deals worth billions. Somewhere among them is a killer. And he's just spent the last hour watching her work.

Or has he?

The doubt gnaws at him as he pulls out his phone to respond. Because the most dangerous thing about Mariana Alvidrez isn't what he's observed—it's what he still doesn't know.

**Scene 6: The evening concludes with Mar...**

**Scene 6: The evening concludes with Mariana excusing herself early**

The terrace had emptied considerably by the time Mariana glanced at her watch—a vintage Cartier that caught the amber light from the torches positioned along the balustrade. Max tracked the movement, filing away another detail in the growing dossier he was building in his mind.

"I'm afraid I have an early call tomorrow," she said, her voice carrying that same measured quality it had maintained throughout their hour-long conversation. Not warm, not cold. Perfectly calibrated. "But I've enjoyed our discussion, Mr. Monroe."

She produced a business card from a small clutch that probably cost more than most people's monthly rent. The card stock was heavy, expensive. Embossed lettering in silver: *Mariana Alvidrez, Strategic Consultant, Vershinsky Holdings*.

"Perhaps we could continue this conversation about investment opportunities?" She tilted her head slightly, and the white orchid pin caught the light. "I'm at the W Hotel through the weekend. We could arrange lunch."

Max accepted the card, letting his fingers brush hers briefly—a calculated moment of contact that might reveal something. Her skin was cool, her grip confident. No tremor, no tell.

"I'd like that," he said, matching her professional tone while allowing just enough warmth to seem genuine. "I'll have my assistant reach out."

Her smile was polite, practiced. "I look forward to it."

She turned with fluid grace, the silk of her dress catching the Mediterranean breeze. Max watched her navigate through the remaining clusters of guests, noting how she acknowledged certain people with subtle nods while completely ignoring others. A woman who knew exactly where everyone stood in the hierarchy.

When she disappeared through the arched doorway into the palace's interior, Max remained on the terrace. The crowd had thinned to perhaps a dozen diehards—venture capitalists nursing cognac, a cluster of blockchain evangelists still arguing about decentralization, a couple locked in what appeared to be either intense negotiation or foreplay. Possibly both.

He moved to the far corner of the terrace, where the stone balustrade overlooked the dark expanse of the Mediterranean. The sea was invisible now, marked only by the absence of light and the rhythmic whisper of waves against the rocks below. Barcelona's lights spread out to his left, a constellation of amber and white that rivaled the stars above.

Max pulled out his phone, scrolling to a contact labeled "David—Berkeley." He hit dial.

Three rings. Then: "You're up late."

His handler's voice carried no trace of sleep, which meant she'd been waiting for his call. Sarah Chen never slept when her assets were in the field.

"The party's winding down," Max said quietly, turning his back to the remaining guests and lowering his voice. "I have something."

"I'm listening."

"Mariana Alvidrez. Works for Mikhail Vershinsky as a strategic consultant. Late thirties, Mexican passport based on her accent, though I'd bet money she's spent significant time in Europe. Fluent English, probably multilingual. Extremely well-informed about tech sector vulnerabilities, particularly in biotech and AI."

"That describes half the consultants in Barcelona this week."

"She was wearing a white orchid pin."

A pause. Max could almost hear Sarah's mind working through the implications.

"Could be coincidence," she said finally.

"Could be." Max watched a yacht's running lights slide across the dark water. "But she was cataloging people all night. I watched her. She wasn't networking—she was studying. The way she engaged with the Nexus Pharma executives, the questions she asked about their security protocols, their travel schedules..."

"Did she make you?"

"No." He was certain of that, at least. "But she's interested. She gave me her card, suggested we continue our conversation about 'investment opportunities' tomorrow."

"You think she's recruiting you?"

"Or vetting me. Or..." He trailed off, not wanting to voice the other possibility—that she was simply doing exactly what she claimed, and he was seeing threats in shadows.

"I'll run a full background check," Sarah said. "Mariana Alvidrez, Vershinsky Holdings. I'll have something for you by morning."

"Prioritize her movements over the past six months. Cross-reference with the timeline of the deaths."

"Already on it. Max—" Sarah's tone shifted, taking on an edge of concern that she rarely showed. "Be careful with this one. If she is who you think she is, you're not dealing with a typical asset. These people are trained to spot hunters."

"I know."

"Do you? Because from where I'm sitting, you sound a little too interested in Ms. Alvidrez."

Max's jaw tightened. "I'm doing my job."

"See that you remember what that job is. We need information, not complications."

The line went dead.

Max stood there for a long moment, the phone still pressed to his ear, staring out at the invisible sea. Sarah wasn't wrong. There was something about Mariana that had gotten under his skin—not attraction, exactly, though she was undeniably striking. It was more like recognition. The sense of meeting someone who operated on the same frequency, who understood the same unspoken rules of the game.

Which made her either the perfect ally or the perfect threat.

He pocketed his phone and pulled out Mariana's business card again, studying it in the torchlight. The embossing was subtle but expensive. The phone number had a Swiss country code. Everything about it screamed legitimacy, which in his experience usually meant the opposite.

Behind him, he heard the party's final guests making their departures, voices echoing off the ancient stone as they called for cars and made plans for tomorrow's sessions. The Global Innovation Summit would continue for three more days—panels on disruption and transformation, private dinners where deals worth billions would be struck over wine that cost thousands.

And somewhere in that carefully orchestrated chaos, a killer was moving.

Max tucked the card into his jacket pocket and turned back toward the palace. The terrace was empty now except for the catering staff beginning their cleanup, moving with quiet efficiency among the abandoned glasses and plates.

As he walked toward the exit, he caught his reflection in one of the tall windows—a man in an expensive suit, playing a role, hunting a ghost. For a moment, he barely recognized himself.

The white orchid pin could be a coincidence. Mariana Alvidrez could be exactly what she claimed.

But Max had survived this long by trusting his instincts, and every instinct he had was screaming that he'd just spent an hour in conversation with someone dangerous.

Tomorrow, he'd find out just how dangerous.

He stepped through the arched doorway into the palace's interior, leaving the terrace and its dark sea behind. Somewhere in Barcelona's glittering sprawl, Mariana was likely doing the same thing he was—reporting to her own handlers, analyzing their conversation, planning her next move.

The game had begun in earnest now.

And Max had the unsettling feeling that he'd just met the person who would either help him solve this case or destroy him in the attempt.
