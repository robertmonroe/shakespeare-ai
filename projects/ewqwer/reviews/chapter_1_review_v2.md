## Chapter 1 Review: "Arnie's City Shuffle"

1. **Internal Consistency**

No issues found.

2. **Clarity**

*   No issues found.

3. **Plot Holes**

*   No issues found.

4. **Redundancy**

*   No issues found.

5.  **Flow and Transitions**

*   The transition from Scene 1 (Johnny at the deli) to Scene 2 (Johnny walking home) feels abrupt. The reader is told he is at "Manny's Deli" when he was previously at Tony's Deli in the last scene. Is this a mistake? This may confuse the reader.

6. **Actionable Fixes**

1.  **Scene 2 Transition:** Smooth the transition between Scene 1 and Scene 2. If Johnny is at "Manny's Deli" it might be good to change it back to Tony's Deli, so as not to confuse the reader. It might be useful to add a sentence or two about him finishing his shift, clocking out, or a brief description of his feelings upon leaving Tony's Deli.
