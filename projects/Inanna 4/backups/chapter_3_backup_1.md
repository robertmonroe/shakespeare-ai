## Chapter 3: The Decree of Extinction

**Scene 1: ---**

**Scene 1: The Golden Throne's Judgment**

The Hall of Eternal Stars stretched before Inanna like the gullet of some vast cosmic serpent, its vaulted ceiling lost in manufactured darkness studded with holographic constellations. Ten thousand years of Anunnaki dominion glittered in those false stars—each point of light representing a world conquered, a species subjugated, a civilization reduced to ore and energy for the empire's endless hunger.

She stood among the nobility on the observation tier, her ceremonial robes of woven gold-light feeling heavier than battle armor. The air tasted of ozone and ancient incense, that particular blend of myrrh and synthesized nebula-dust that only burned in the presence of the King. Around her, the great houses of Nibiru had assembled in their finery—the Igigi warrior clans in their crimson mantles, the Nephilim administrators draped in silver circuitry, the lesser bloodlines crowding the galleries above like carrion birds awaiting a feast.

Below, on the obsidian floor polished to mirror-brightness, the throne of Anu rose like a frozen explosion of gold and crystal. Her father sat upon it, ancient and terrible, his face a mask of serene authority that Inanna had learned to read since childhood. Today, that mask showed satisfaction.

*He's already decided,* she realized, her stomach clenching. *This ceremony is merely theater.*

"The question before us," Anu's voice rolled through the hall, amplified by acoustic architecture perfected across millennia, "is not whether the human experiment has failed. That much is beyond dispute."

A murmur of agreement rippled through the assembled nobles. Inanna kept her face carefully neutral, though her fingers curled against her palms hard enough to leave crescents in her flesh.

"The question," her father continued, rising from his throne with the fluid grace that belied his age, "is how we address this failure. How we correct the contamination before it spreads beyond acceptable parameters."

On the massive display screens flanking the throne, images materialized—Earth, that blue-green jewel spinning in the darkness of the outer system. The view zoomed closer, showing human settlements spreading across the fertile crescents, the river valleys, the coastal plains. Cities of mud brick and carved stone. Fields golden with grain. Children playing in dusty streets.

Inanna had walked those streets. She had eaten bread baked in those clay ovens, had listened to human poets compose verses to her beauty, had watched mothers sing their infants to sleep under stars their eyes could barely perceive. She had been worshipped as a goddess, yes—but she had also been *seen* by them in ways her own kind never bothered to look.

"Genetic drift has exceeded all projections," the Chief Architect of the human project announced, stepping forward with his data tablets glowing. Lord Enlil, her uncle, whose laboratories had first spliced Anunnaki essence into the primitive hominids. "The kill switch remains viable in approximately sixty-three percent of the population. The remaining thirty-seven percent have developed... anomalies."

"Anomalies." Anu tasted the word. "Explain."

"They're breeding true, Majesty. The modifications are becoming hereditary. At current rates, within another fifty generations, the kill switch will be completely bred out of the population." Enlil's voice carried no emotion—he might have been discussing crop yields or mineral extraction rates. "Additionally, their cognitive development has accelerated beyond design specifications. They're asking questions. Building things we didn't teach them. Some have begun to suspect the truth of their origins."

A sharp intake of breath from somewhere behind Inanna. She didn't turn to see who still possessed enough conscience to be disturbed.

"Then the solution is clear," announced Lord Nergal from the warrior tier, his scarred face split by a predator's grin. "Activate the kill switch in those who carry it. Hunt down the rest. I'll lead the culling myself—my Igigi have grown soft without proper sport."

Laughter, scattered but genuine, echoed through the hall. Inanna felt bile rise in her throat.

"A crude solution, nephew," Anu said, though his tone suggested approval rather than rebuke. "And incomplete. Even if we eliminated every human on the planet's surface, their genetic material has spread too far. Caves, islands, remote highlands—we would spend centuries hunting down survivors, and the cost in resources would be... inefficient."

He gestured, and the display shifted. Now it showed the polar regions of Earth, vast sheets of ice gleaming white against the darkness of the northern seas.

"Chief Architect, present your alternative."

Enlil bowed, manipulating his tablets. "The orbital platforms we positioned during the initial terraforming remain functional. By redirecting their output to the polar ice sheets, we can trigger a cascading melt event. The resulting floods will cover approximately ninety-four percent of current human habitation zones within a single lunar cycle."

The image animated, showing water levels rising, engulfing those mud-brick cities, drowning those golden fields, sweeping away those children in their dusty streets.

"Simultaneously," Enlil continued, "we activate the genetic kill switch through atmospheric dispersal. Those who survive the initial flooding will succumb to systemic organ failure within days. Total extinction achieved within one quarter-cycle, with minimal resource expenditure and no risk to Anunnaki personnel."

Silence fell over the hall. Inanna counted her heartbeats—one, two, three—waiting for someone, *anyone*, to object.

"The mineral extraction facilities?" asked Lord Shamash, ever practical.

"Will require reconstruction, but the automated systems are designed to survive submersion. We estimate eighteen months to restore full production capacity."

"And the biological samples? The genetic archive?"

"Already secured aboard the orbital stations. The human template can be reconstructed if needed, with appropriate modifications to prevent future... complications."

Shamash nodded, apparently satisfied. Around him, other nobles were already calculating their shares of the reconstruction contracts, their eyes bright with avarice.

Inanna's gaze swept the crowd, searching for allies, for doubt, for anything resembling the horror that churned in her own chest. She found precious few. Lord Enki, Enlil's brother and rival, wore an expression of carefully masked distaste—but he had always opposed the human project on scientific grounds, not moral ones. Lady Ereshkigal, keeper of the death records, watched with the professional interest of one anticipating a significant increase in her workload. 

And there—near the back of the Igigi delegation—a young warrior whose name Inanna couldn't recall, his face pale, his hands trembling slightly at his sides. Their eyes met for a brief moment before he looked away, shame and fear warring in his expression.

*At least I'm not entirely alone,* she thought. *Though that may not matter.*

"The Council of Twelve has reviewed the proposal," Anu announced, reclaiming the hall's attention. "We have found it sound. Therefore, by the authority vested in this throne by the First Compact of Nibiru, I hereby decree: the human experiment is terminated. All specimens are to be eliminated. The cleansing will commence at the next orbital alignment—fourteen days hence."

He raised his scepter, that ancient rod of office that had commanded the fates of a hundred worlds, and brought it down against the throne's arm with a sound like thunder.

"So it is spoken. So it shall be done."

The hall erupted in applause. Nobles raised their voices in praise of the King's wisdom, his decisive leadership, his protection of the empire's interests. Someone began a chant—"Anu! Anu! Anu!"—and it spread through the crowd like wildfire.

Inanna forced her hands to move, to mime the motions of celebration. Her face ached from the effort of maintaining her smile. Around her, the cream of Anunnaki civilization cheered the extinction of four billion souls as casually as they might celebrate a successful pest extermination.

*Fourteen days,* she thought, the number burning itself into her mind. *I have fourteen days to save them.*

On the screens, the simulation continued its terrible loop—water rising, cities drowning, a species dying. And in the golden light of the Hall of Eternal Stars, the gods of humanity toasted their creation's end with cups of fermented starlight.

Inanna drank when the cup was pressed into her hand. The liquid tasted like ashes.

**Scene 1: The Anunnaki nobility gathers ...**

The Grand Tribunal Chamber hummed with the resonance of a thousand crystalline frequencies, each pillar of translucent quartz singing its own harmonic note as the assembled nobility took their positions. Princess Inanna stood at the edge of the royal dais, her ceremonial robes—woven from light-reactive polymers that shifted between gold and deep violet—feeling like chains against her skin.

Below them, through the chamber's transparent floor, Earth turned in slow majesty. The blue-green sphere caught the light of its yellow sun, clouds swirling in patterns that Inanna had memorized over centuries of observation. She could see the fertile crescent of Mesopotamia from here, that cradle of human civilization where she had walked among them, learned their names, tasted their wine.

*Ninety thousand years*, she thought. *We shaped them for ninety thousand years, and now—*

"The Council will attend," announced the Herald, his voice amplified through the acoustic architecture of the chamber. The crystalline walls caught the sound and multiplied it, making the words seem to come from everywhere at once.

Three hundred Anunnaki nobles arranged themselves in concentric arcs around the central platform, their bioluminescent skin casting soft glows of blue, green, and amber across the polished floor. They wore the marks of their houses—genetic modifications that distinguished bloodlines stretching back to the founding of the empire. Some bore additional eyes, others elongated skulls or patterns of scales across their temples. All of them beautiful by Anunnaki standards. All of them cold.

Inanna caught the eye of her brother Enlil as he took his position at the military console to her right. His face betrayed nothing—it never did—but his fingers moved across the holographic interface with barely contained eagerness. The data streams he summoned painted the air with damning evidence: population graphs spiking upward, genetic markers highlighted in warning red, thermal imaging of human settlements spreading like luminescent mold across Earth's surface.

"They breed faster than projected," Enlil had told her that morning, his voice carrying the clinical detachment of a scientist discussing bacterial cultures. "The modification we introduced to accelerate their development has... exceeded parameters."

*Exceeded parameters.* As if human children laughing in the streets of Uruk were a calculation error.

The Herald struck his staff against the floor, and the chamber fell silent.

"All rise for His Eternal Majesty, King Anu, Sovereign of the Twelve Stations, Lord of the Celestial Throne, Father of the Anunnaki People."

Inanna rose with the others, her muscles moving through the familiar ritual while her mind raced through possibilities. She had three days, perhaps four, before the decree would be implemented. Three days to—

Her father entered through the primary portal, and all thought scattered.

King Anu moved with the gravity of ages, each step deliberate, each gesture weighted with millennia of absolute power. His skin bore the deep azure of pure royal blood, unmarked by the genetic modifications that lesser houses used to distinguish themselves. He needed no modification. His presence alone commanded recognition.

Behind him came Queen Antu, Inanna's mother, her expression as serene and unreadable as a frozen lake. She had not spoken to Inanna in three cycles—not since Inanna had made the mistake of asking about the humans' potential for citizenship within the empire.

"Be seated," Anu commanded, and three hundred bodies moved as one.

The King took his position at the center of the dais, directly above the image of Earth. The symbolism was not lost on Inanna—her father standing over the world like a god preparing to pass judgment. Which, she supposed, was precisely what he was.

"We gather to address a matter of imperial security," Anu began, his voice carrying the harmonic undertones that marked royal speech patterns. "A matter that has been discussed in private council for some time, but which now requires formal acknowledgment before the nobility."

Holographic displays flickered to life around the chamber, each one showing a different aspect of human civilization. Inanna recognized the images—the ziggurats they had helped humans build, the irrigation systems that turned desert into farmland, the early writing that recorded their myths and laws. Myths that included the Anunnaki themselves, remembered as gods who had descended from the heavens.

"The human project," Anu continued, "was initiated ninety thousand years ago as a labor solution. The indigenous primates of the third planet showed promise—sufficient intelligence for basic tasks, sufficient docility for control. Our geneticists modified them, accelerated their development, created a workforce capable of mining the gold our empire requires."

A murmur of agreement rippled through the assembly. Inanna kept her face carefully neutral, but her hands had begun to tremble beneath her robes.

"For millennia, the project succeeded. Humans served their purpose. They extracted resources, built infrastructure, worshipped us as was appropriate." Anu paused, and something cold entered his voice. "But the project has exceeded its parameters."

Enlil stepped forward, summoning new data streams with practiced efficiency. "Current human population: approximately fifteen million, concentrated primarily in the Mesopotamian region but spreading rapidly. Projected population in one hundred cycles: over fifty million. In five hundred cycles, they will have colonized every habitable region of the planet."

The numbers hung in the air, glowing red.

"More concerning," Enlil continued, "are the genetic markers. The modifications we introduced to enhance their cognitive function have proven... unstable. They are evolving faster than projected. Their capacity for abstract thought, for innovation, for *ambition*—" He let the word hang. "—has exceeded all models."

"They've begun asking questions," someone called from the assembly. Lord Nergal, Inanna noted—always eager to fan flames of fear. "Questions about their origins. About *us*. They're developing their own theories, their own explanations for their existence."

"They're developing weapons," another voice added. "Primitive, yes, but the trajectory is clear. Give them another thousand years—"

"They won't have another thousand years."

Anu's words cut through the rising murmur like a blade through silk. The chamber fell silent.

"The Council has reviewed all options," the King continued. "Increased oversight. Genetic modification to reduce their cognitive capacity. Selective culling of their most advanced populations." He shook his head slowly. "None of these solutions address the fundamental problem. The human genome is inherently unstable. It will continue to evolve, continue to exceed parameters, continue to pose a threat to imperial security."

Inanna felt the words coming before her father spoke them. Felt them like a physical weight pressing against her chest.

"Therefore, by royal decree, the human project is hereby terminated. Total extinction will be achieved through activation of the genetic kill switch implanted in their original design, combined with environmental catastrophe to eliminate any survivors." Anu raised his hand, and a new holographic display appeared—schematics of the orbital weapons platforms, trajectories calculated to redirect polar ice masses, flood projections that would drown every human settlement on the planet. "The operation will commence in four standard cycles."

The chamber erupted.

Not in protest—in *celebration*.

Inanna watched in horror as the assembled nobility applauded, as they called out congratulations to her father, as they discussed the technical details with the enthusiasm of children planning a festival. Lord Nergal was already calculating resource reallocation. Lady Ereshkigal wondered aloud if they might preserve some specimens for study. Commander Ninurta asked about the timeline for recolonization once the floods receded.

*Pest control*, Inanna thought, the words bitter in her mind. *They're discussing genocide as if it were pest control.*

She scanned the crowd desperately, searching for any face that showed discomfort, any sign that she wasn't alone in her horror. There—Lord Enki, her uncle, his expression troubled as he studied the flood projections. And there—Lady Nisaba, keeper of records, who had spent decades cataloging human writing systems. A handful of faces, perhaps five or six among three hundred, that didn't share the general enthusiasm.

It wasn't enough. It would never be enough.

"Inanna."

Her mother's voice, soft but sharp, cut through her spiraling thoughts. Queen Antu had moved to stand beside her, close enough that their conversation would be private.

"Control your face," Antu murmured. "You're broadcasting your thoughts to everyone in this chamber."

Inanna forced her expression into neutrality, but her hands continued to shake. "Mother, you can't support this. You've seen them. You've walked among them. They're not animals, they're—"

"They're a failed experiment." Antu's voice held no cruelty, only the flat certainty of absolute conviction. "Your father is doing what must be done. What you need to do is accept that and remember your place."

"My place?" Inanna turned to face her mother fully, keeping her voice low but unable to keep the edge from her words. "My place is to stand here and applaud while we murder fifteen million thinking, feeling beings? Beings we *created*?"

"Your place," Antu replied, "is to be a princess of the Anunnaki Empire. To support your father's decisions. To prepare for your eventual role in governance." Her eyes, the same deep gold as Inanna's own, held a warning. "Whatever sympathy you've developed for the humans, whatever attachment—it ends now. Do you understand?"

Before Inanna could respond, the crowd began to disperse, the formal portion of the ceremony concluded. Nobles clustered in groups, still discussing the decree with evident satisfaction. Enlil was surrounded by military commanders, already planning the logistics of extinction.

And her father was watching her.

Across the chamber, over the heads of celebrating nobles, King Anu's gaze met Inanna's. His expression was unreadable, but something in his eyes—knowledge, perhaps, or warning—made her blood run cold.

*He knows*, she realized. *He knows exactly what I'm feeling.*

The question was what he intended to do about it.

As the nobility filed out of the Grand Tribunal Chamber, Inanna remained on the dais, watching Earth turn slowly beneath her feet. Somewhere down there, in the fertile valleys and growing cities, fifteen million humans were living their lives. Farming, building, loving, dreaming. They had no idea that their creators had just signed their death warrant.

Four days. She had four days to find a way to save them.

Or to die trying.

**Scene 2: King Anu formally announces th...**

**Scene 2: King Anu formally announces the extinction decree**

The Grand Tribunal Chamber stretched before Inanna like the throat of some vast, crystalline beast. Bioluminescent columns rose three hundred meters toward a domed ceiling that displayed real-time feeds from a thousand orbital sensors, each one trained on the blue-green sphere that had become humanity's cradle—and would soon become their tomb.

Inanna stood among the assembled nobility on the eastern observation tier, her ceremonial robes weighing heavily on her shoulders. The fabric was woven with living circuitry that pulsed in rhythm with the Nibiru's power grid, marking her as royalty. Today, she wished she could tear it from her body.

Below, on the central dais, her father's throne rose like a spear of black obsidian shot through with veins of molten gold. King Anu sat upon it with the stillness of a statue, his ancient eyes surveying the thousand Anunnaki who had gathered to witness this moment. Behind him, the holographic projection of Earth rotated slowly, its continents rendered in perfect detail, its oceans shimmering with data overlays that tracked every human settlement, every population center, every heartbeat of the species they had created.

"The Council of Twelve has reached its verdict," Anu's voice rolled through the chamber like distant thunder, amplified by the acoustic architecture until it seemed to emanate from the walls themselves. "The human experiment has failed."

A murmur rippled through the crowd—not of dissent, but of satisfaction. Inanna felt her stomach clench.

"For two hundred thousand years, we have guided these creatures," Anu continued, rising from his throne. His silver robes cascaded around him like liquid metal, and the ceremonial crown upon his brow—a circlet of crystallized dark matter that had been worn by seventeen generations of Anunnaki kings—caught the light of a dozen hovering sensor drones. "We gave them intelligence. We gave them purpose. We gave them the gift of serving something greater than themselves."

He gestured, and the holographic Earth zoomed in on a sprawling human city—one of the newer settlements that had sprung up along the Tigris River. Inanna recognized the distinctive ziggurats, the irrigation channels, the bustling markets where humans traded goods and ideas with an enthusiasm that had always fascinated her.

"And how have they repaid us?" Anu's voice hardened. "With defiance. With ambition. With the audacity to imagine themselves our equals."

The image shifted, showing recordings from the surface—humans building temples not to honor their Anunnaki masters, but to worship abstract concepts. Justice. Truth. Freedom. Words that had no place in the vocabulary of slaves.

"They have begun to question," Anu said. "To dream. To *rebel*."

He let the word hang in the air like a blade.

"Commander Enlil will now present the solution."

Inanna's half-brother strode forward from the military contingent, his boots striking the dais with precise, measured steps. Where Anu was ancient and regal, Enlil was vital and hungry—a warrior in his prime, his muscular frame barely contained by his ceremonial armor. The neural interface ports along his temples gleamed with recent use; he'd been running combat simulations again, Inanna knew. Practicing for a war against an enemy that couldn't possibly fight back.

"Honored nobles of Nibiru," Enlil began, his voice carrying the clipped efficiency of a soldier delivering a tactical briefing, "what you are about to witness represents the culmination of three centuries of contingency planning. Project Deluge is not merely an extinction event—it is a masterwork of strategic engineering."

He raised his hand, and the holographic display transformed. Earth shrank to a quarter of its previous size, making room for a complex web of orbital trajectories, satellite positions, and countdown timers.

"Phase One: The Genetic Cascade."

A new image materialized—a double helix of human DNA, rotating slowly. Enlil gestured, and specific sequences began to glow red.

"When we first engineered the human genome, we incorporated certain... safeguards. Dormant sequences embedded in their mitochondrial DNA, passed from mother to child for a hundred thousand generations. These sequences are harmless—until activated by a specific frequency of electromagnetic radiation."

He smiled, and Inanna saw the predator behind his eyes.

"Once triggered, the cascade begins. Cellular replication errors. Immune system collapse. Neurological degradation." The DNA strand on the display began to unravel, its structure collapsing into chaos. "Within seventy-two hours of activation, any human exposed to the signal will experience complete systemic failure. Death will follow within the week."

A appreciative murmur rose from the assembled nobles. Inanna heard someone behind her whisper, "Elegant. Truly elegant."

She wanted to scream.

"The activation signal will be broadcast from our orbital relay network," Enlil continued, highlighting a constellation of satellites in the holographic display. "Global coverage will be achieved within six hours. Conservative estimates suggest a ninety-four percent mortality rate from Phase One alone."

"And the remaining six percent?" someone called from the crowd—Lord Marduk, if Inanna recognized the voice correctly. A minor noble with major ambitions, always eager to demonstrate his attention to detail.

Enlil's smile widened. "An excellent question, my lord. This brings us to Phase Two: The Deluge itself."

The display shifted again, now showing Earth's polar regions in extreme detail. Vast sheets of ice, accumulated over millions of years, glittered under the light of a distant sun.

"Our orbital weapons platforms—the same systems we use for asteroid deflection—will be repurposed for a new target." Enlil gestured, and red targeting reticles appeared over both poles. "Concentrated thermal beams will destabilize the ice sheets, triggering a cascading melt event of unprecedented scale."

The simulation began to play. Inanna watched in mute horror as the polar ice caps began to glow, then crack, then collapse into the surrounding oceans. Massive waves radiated outward from both poles, growing in size and speed as they propagated across the global ocean system.

"Sea levels will rise by approximately one hundred meters within the first thirty days," Enlil narrated, his tone almost bored, as if discussing agricultural yields rather than the drowning of a world. "Every coastal settlement will be destroyed. Every river valley will become an inland sea. Every lowland will become a grave."

The holographic Earth was transforming before their eyes. Continents shrank as the waters rose. The fertile crescent where humanity had built its greatest cities vanished beneath a spreading blue stain. The simulation tracked population centers as they winked out of existence—millions of lives reduced to statistical annotations, casualty projections scrolling past in neat columns of figures.

"Any humans who survive the genetic cascade will find themselves in a world without shelter, without food, without hope." Enlil's voice rose with barely concealed triumph. "The few who manage to reach high ground will face starvation, exposure, and the predatory species we've already begun seeding in the mountain regions. Within one year, human population will be reduced to zero."

He turned to face the crowd, arms spread wide.

"The human experiment will be *concluded*."

The chamber erupted in applause.

Inanna stood frozen as the sound washed over her—thousands of hands striking together in approval, thousands of voices raised in celebration. Around her, nobles who had dined with human servants, who had accepted human tribute, who had watched human children play in the gardens of their orbital estates, now cheered for the extinction of an entire species.

"Magnificent," breathed Lady Ninlil beside her, her eyes bright with enthusiasm. "Simply magnificent. I must admit, I had my doubts about the genetic approach—seemed almost too subtle. But combined with the flooding? Poetic. Truly poetic."

Inanna couldn't respond. Her throat had closed, her lungs refusing to draw breath. On the holographic display, the simulation had completed its run. Earth hung in the void, transformed—a world of endless ocean dotted with scattered islands, its atmosphere choked with debris, its surface scoured clean of every trace of human civilization.

Clean. That was how they would describe it. A clean solution to a messy problem.

She looked at the faces around her, searching desperately for any sign of doubt, any flicker of conscience. Lord Shamash, the arbiter of Anunnaki law, stood with his arms crossed, his expression thoughtful but not troubled. Lady Ishkur, who had once commissioned a human artist to paint her portrait, was whispering excitedly to her companion about the "elegant efficiency" of the plan. Even old Enki, who had designed the human genome in the first place, watched the proceedings with the detached interest of a scientist observing an experiment's conclusion.

Only a handful of faces showed any discomfort. Young Lord Dumuzi, barely past his first century, had gone pale and was staring at his feet. Lady Geshtinanna clutched her ceremonial staff with white-knuckled hands. And in the far corner of the military contingent, a grizzled commander whose name Inanna couldn't recall was shaking his head slowly, his lips pressed into a thin line.

But none of them spoke. None of them protested. None of them did anything but stand in silence as the applause continued, as her father raised his hands to accept the crowd's adulation, as her brother basked in the approval of a civilization that had just voted for genocide.

"Let it be recorded," Anu's voice cut through the celebration, silencing the crowd with the weight of royal authority. "On this day, in the three hundred and forty-seventh year of my reign, the Council of Twelve has decreed the termination of the human species. Project Deluge will commence at the next orbital alignment—fourteen days hence."

Fourteen days. Inanna felt the number settle into her chest like a stone. Fourteen days until the signal went out. Fourteen days until the ice began to melt. Fourteen days until everything she had come to love about that small blue world was swept away forever.

"May our descendants look back on this moment," Anu concluded, his voice ringing with ceremonial gravitas, "and know that we did what was necessary. That we had the courage to correct our mistakes. That we proved ourselves worthy of the stars."

The crowd bowed as one, a wave of silver and gold robes dipping toward the dais. Inanna forced herself to bow with them, her body moving through the motions while her mind raced.

Fourteen days.

When she raised her head, she found Enlil watching her from the dais. His eyes met hers across the vast chamber, and she saw something in them that made her blood run cold.

He knew.

He couldn't know everything—couldn't know about the stolen access codes, the hidden supply cache, the navigation charts she'd been memorizing for months. But he knew enough. He knew that his half-sister's bow had been a fraction too slow, her applause a fraction too quiet. He knew that she didn't share the crowd's enthusiasm.

And he was *smiling*.

Inanna looked away, forcing her expression into careful neutrality. Around her, the nobles were beginning to disperse, breaking into smaller groups to discuss the technical details of extinction, to plan celebration feasts, to position themselves for whatever political advantages might emerge from humanity's demise.

She moved with them, letting the crowd carry her toward the chamber's eastern exit. But her mind was already elsewhere—already calculating distances, already reviewing contingencies, already preparing for the conversation she knew was coming.

Her father would want to speak with her. And when he did, she would need to be ready.

Fourteen days to save a world.

The countdown had begun.

**Scene 3: As the decree is ratified, the...**

The celebration hall blazed with obscene splendor.

Crystal formations harvested from Nibiru's deepest caverns lined the walls, each one engineered to capture and refract the bioluminescent light streaming from living chandeliers overhead. The organisms—colonial creatures from the methane seas of a conquered moon—pulsed in synchronized rhythms, their blue-green glow washing over the assembled nobility like waves upon a shore.

Inanna stepped through the arched entrance and felt her stomach lurch.

They were already drinking.

Servants in simple gray tunics moved through the crowd bearing trays of fermented nectar, the amber liquid glowing faintly with the enzymes that made it palatable only to Anunnaki physiology. The nobles snatched glasses without acknowledgment, their attention fixed on the holographic entertainment projecting above the central fountain—a rotating display of Earth, its blue surface marked with red zones indicating population centers.

"Remarkable density in the river valleys," Lord Shamash was saying to a cluster of admirers, gesturing at the projection with his drink. "The creatures congregated there like insects around sweetwater. Makes the cleanup considerably more efficient."

Laughter rippled through the group.

Inanna forced herself to keep walking, her ceremonial robes suddenly too heavy, too warm. The golden thread woven through the fabric caught the bioluminescent light and threw patterns across the polished floor—patterns that reminded her, absurdly, of the cave paintings she'd observed through the monitoring drones. Human hands pressed against stone, leaving marks that said *I was here. I existed.*

Soon, nothing would remain to prove they ever had.

"Princess!" A young noble whose name she couldn't remember approached with an eager smile. "Magnificent news, isn't it? My father says the flooding will create the most spectacular geological formations. He's already planning an expedition to observe the aftermath."

"How... forward-thinking of him."

"Indeed! Though I confess, I'll miss the entertainment value. The monitoring feeds have been quite diverting these past centuries. Did you know some of them actually developed music? Primitive percussion and vocal arrangements. Charming, in a simple-minded way."

Inanna's nails dug into her palms. "Charming."

"Ah, but I'm monopolizing your attention." The noble bowed with practiced grace. "Do enjoy the celebration, Princess."

He vanished into the crowd, and Inanna resumed her slow circuit of the hall, searching. There had to be others who felt the wrongness of this. There had to be faces that reflected the horror coiling in her chest.

She found precious few.

Near the fountain, a minor administrator stared into his drink with an expression that might have been discomfort—or might have been simple indigestion. By the eastern windows, a young priestess of the temple stood apart from her sisters, her lips moving in what could have been prayer or merely conversation with herself. An elderly scholar in the robes of the Academy watched the holographic Earth with something other than celebration in his ancient eyes.

Three. Perhaps four, if she counted the servant who flinched every time someone mentioned the word "extinction."

Out of hundreds.

"Inanna."

The voice came from her left, barely above a whisper. Inanna turned to find her mother standing in the shadow of a crystal formation, her silver robes blending with the blue-green light until she seemed almost translucent.

Queen Antu held no drink. Her hands were clasped before her, the only sign of tension the slight whitening of her knuckles.

"Mother."

They stood in silence for a moment, the celebration swirling around them like a current around two stones in a stream. Antu's face was as composed as ever—the perfect mask of royal dignity she had worn for millennia. But her eyes...

Her eyes met Inanna's, and in them, Inanna saw something she couldn't quite name. Not horror, exactly. Not even disagreement. Something older. Something tired.

"You should be mingling," Antu said finally. "Your absence from the festivities will be noted."

"Let it be noted."

"Inanna." The single word carried a weight of warning.

"How can you stand here?" Inanna kept her voice low, conscious of the nobles drifting past. "How can any of them? We're discussing the murder of billions, and they're treating it like—like—"

"Like the culling of an invasive species." Antu's tone was flat. "Like the controlled burn of an overgrown forest. Like a hundred other administrative necessities this empire has undertaken across a thousand worlds."

"Is that what you believe?"

The question hung between them. Antu's expression flickered—just for an instant—before the mask reasserted itself.

"What I believe is irrelevant. What matters is what is."

"That's not an answer."

"No," Antu agreed softly. "It isn't."

Across the hall, Lord Enlil's booming laugh cut through the ambient music. He was surrounded by military officers, their uniforms gleaming with campaign ribbons earned on worlds Inanna had never visited. They were discussing the orbital weapons, she realized. Comparing the technical specifications like children with new toys.

"Your father will want to see you perform your duties," Antu continued. "The nobility expects the royal family to present a unified front."

"A unified front in genocide."

"A unified front in *survival.*" For the first time, something sharp entered Antu's voice. "Do you think I don't understand, daughter? Do you think I've lived these thousands of years without questioning? But questioning and acting are different things. The former is private. The latter has consequences."

Inanna stared at her mother, trying to read the truth behind the careful words. "You disagree with the decree."

"I said nothing of the sort."

"You didn't have to."

Antu's jaw tightened. She glanced around the hall—a quick, practiced sweep that took in every potential observer—before leaning closer.

"There are things," she breathed, "that a queen cannot say. Cannot even think, not in any way that leaves evidence. But a mother..." She paused, and for just a moment, her hand brushed Inanna's arm. "A mother can hope that her daughter is wiser than she appears. And more cautious."

Before Inanna could respond, Antu stepped back, her public mask sliding into place with practiced ease.

"Do try the nectar, dear. The vintage is exceptional." She raised her voice just enough to be overheard. "And do remember to congratulate Lord Shamash on his contribution to the environmental projections. He's quite proud of his calculations."

Then she was gone, gliding through the crowd with the effortless grace of someone who had spent millennia navigating treacherous waters.

Inanna stood alone, her mother's words echoing in her mind. *Wiser than she appears. More cautious.*

A warning. But also, perhaps, permission.

She looked around the celebration hall one final time—at the laughing nobles, the flowing drinks, the holographic Earth spinning slowly above the fountain with its billions of doomed inhabitants marked in red. She memorized every face that showed discomfort, every servant who flinched, every small sign that the Anunnaki conscience had not been entirely extinguished.

They were few. But they existed.

And if Inanna succeeded in what she was planning, they might one day matter.

She straightened her shoulders, composed her features into an expression of appropriate celebration, and began moving through the crowd toward Lord Shamash. She would play her role. She would congratulate and smile and pretend.

But tonight, when the celebration ended and the halls grew quiet, she would make her final preparations.

The humans would not die without a fight.

Even if she had to give them the weapons herself.

**Scene 4: After the celebration, Inanna ...**

The summons came through her personal comm unit—a single pulse of crimson light that made her blood run cold. Her father's cipher. His private chambers. Immediately.

Inanna stood before the obsidian doors, composing her features into the mask she had worn since childhood. Serene. Dutiful. Empty. The doors recognized her biometric signature and parted with a whisper of displaced air.

King Anu's private chambers bore no resemblance to the opulent throne room where he performed his power for the masses. Here, austerity reigned. The walls were bare gray stone, unpolished and ancient—fragments of Nibiru's original crust, preserved from before the great catastrophe that had set their world wandering between stars. Holographic displays floated in precise geometric arrangements, each one showing strategic data: troop movements, resource allocations, the slow orbital dance of their fleet around Earth.

Her father stood with his back to her, studying a three-dimensional map of Earth's polar regions. Ice caps glowed an ethereal blue, overlaid with targeting trajectories in arterial red.

"Close the door, Inanna."

She obeyed, and the obsidian panels sealed behind her with a sound like a tomb being shut.

"You left the celebration early." Anu did not turn. "Your absence was noted."

"I developed a headache, Father. The crowd, the noise—"

"Do not." The word cracked through the chamber like a whip. Now he turned, and Inanna saw something in his eyes she had rarely witnessed: genuine anger, barely contained. "Do not insult my intelligence with lies you would not believe yourself."

He gestured, and one of the floating displays shifted, expanding to fill the space between them. Inanna watched her own face appear—security footage from the observation deck, timestamp marking it as three solar cycles past. She saw herself pressing her hand against the viewport, tears tracking silver lines down her cheeks as she gazed at Earth.

The image changed. Her, accessing restricted cultural archives. Her, lingering in the bio-research wing where human specimens were studied. Her, questioning a junior scientist about the genetic kill switch's mechanism with poorly disguised horror.

"You have been monitoring me," she said, proud that her voice remained steady.

"I have been protecting you." Anu dismissed the display with a wave. "Do you think you are the first young royal to develop... sympathies? Your grandmother wept for a dying species once. A silicon-based collective on the third moon of Aldebaran. She recovered. You will too."

He moved to a cabinet carved from petrified wood—a relic from some long-dead world—and withdrew a crystal decanter filled with amber liquid. The scent of fermented starfruit reached Inanna's nostrils as he poured two glasses.

"I have tried to be patient," Anu continued, offering her a glass. She took it but did not drink. "I told myself it was youth. Inexperience. That exposure to the humans' art and music had temporarily clouded your judgment." He sipped his own drink, watching her over the rim. "But tonight, at the ceremony, I saw your face. I saw what you were thinking."

"And what was I thinking, Father?"

"That we are monsters." He said it simply, without accusation. "That what we do is wrong. That these creatures—these beautiful, tragic, doomed creatures—deserve to live."

The accuracy of his assessment stole her breath. She had always known her father was perceptive, but this felt like violation, like he had reached into her skull and extracted her most private thoughts.

"They are sentient beings," she heard herself say. "They create. They love. They—"

"They are tools." Anu's voice hardened. "Tools we made for a specific purpose, tools that have outlived their usefulness. Would you weep for a mining drone? A harvesting automaton?"

"They are not machines!"

"No. They are worse." He set down his glass with deliberate precision. "Machines do not rebel. Machines do not dream of overthrowing their creators. Machines do not breed beyond control and consume resources meant for their betters."

He crossed the chamber to a display case Inanna had never been permitted to examine closely. Inside, behind shimmering force fields, rested artifacts of terrible antiquity: a crown of black metal, a scepter that seemed to drink the light, and a small clay tablet covered in wedge-shaped marks.

"Do you know what this is?" He indicated the tablet.

"No."

"It is a prayer. One of the first humans ever wrote it, thousands of years ago. Do you know what it says?" He did not wait for her answer. "'Great Anu, father of gods, we are your servants. Command us and we obey. Our lives are yours, our deaths are yours. We exist only for your glory.'"

He turned to face her, and his expression had shifted to something almost sorrowful.

"They understood, once. They knew their place. But we were careless. We let them forget. We let them develop delusions of independence, of worth, of rights." He shook his head. "This extinction is not cruelty, daughter. It is correction. It is the restoration of natural order."

"Natural?" Inanna's laugh came out bitter, broken. "We made them. We designed their very genes. There is nothing natural about any of this."

"Then call it necessary." Anu's patience was visibly thinning. "Call it inevitable. Call it whatever you must to accept it, because accept it you will."

He moved closer, and despite herself, Inanna took a step back. Her father had never struck her—had never needed to. His disapproval alone had always been weapon enough.

"You are my daughter," he said, his voice dropping to something almost tender. "My blood. My heir. The future of our dynasty flows through your veins. I will not see that future compromised by misplaced sentiment for a species that will be forgotten within a generation."

"And if I cannot forget them?"

The tenderness vanished. "Then you will be forgotten with them."

The words hung in the recycled air between them, their meaning unmistakable. Inanna thought of the exile ships, the prison moons, the quiet disappearances of those who had opposed royal will. Her aunt, who had spoken against the conquest of the Pleiades colonies. Her cousin, who had questioned the legitimacy of Anu's claim to the throne. Gone, all of them. Erased from history as thoroughly as the humans would soon be erased from Earth.

"I am offering you a choice," Anu continued. "A choice I am not required to offer. Embrace your heritage. Take your place beside me as we shepherd our people into a new era. The humans' resources will fuel our expansion for millennia. Their planet will be terraformed into a paradise worthy of Anunnaki habitation. You could rule it, Inanna. Earth could be yours."

She saw it then—the future he was painting. Herself on a throne of human bones, presiding over a world scrubbed clean of its original inhabitants. Gardens growing where cities had stood. Palaces rising from the ashes of human civilization. A queen of the dead.

"And my other choice?"

"There is no other choice." His eyes were ancient, cold, utterly certain. "There is only acceptance or destruction. Those are the only options our universe provides."

Inanna looked at her father—really looked at him—and saw for the first time the monster he had always been. Not evil, perhaps. Not in his own mind. Simply incapable of recognizing humanity in anything that was not Anunnaki. To him, the humans were no more worthy of moral consideration than the bacteria that lived in their guts.

And she understood, with crystalline clarity, that she could never make him see otherwise.

So she did what she had learned to do in a lifetime of surviving his court. She lied.

"You are right, Father." She let her shoulders drop, let her voice tremble with manufactured shame. "I have been foolish. Weak. I allowed myself to become... attached to subjects of study, nothing more."

She raised her eyes to meet his, filling them with the desperate need for approval she had genuinely felt as a child.

"I do not want to be forgotten. I do not want to lose my place, my family, everything I have known." A tear—real, but born of grief rather than submission—traced down her cheek. "Please. Help me be stronger. Help me be worthy of your legacy."

Anu studied her for a long moment. She felt his gaze like a physical weight, pressing against her defenses, searching for cracks in her performance.

Then he smiled—a cold expression, but genuine.

"I knew you would see reason." He reached out and wiped the tear from her cheek with one calloused thumb. "You have your mother's softness, but my steel lies beneath it. I have always known this."

He gestured toward the door. "Go. Rest. The extinction will begin at the next solar conjunction—three rotations from now. By then, I expect you to have fully mastered your emotions. You will stand beside me as we watch the floods cleanse Earth. You will not weep. You will not flinch. You will show our people that the royal house stands united."

"Yes, Father."

"And Inanna?" She paused at the door. "I will be watching. Always. Remember that."

She inclined her head in acknowledgment and stepped through the obsidian doors. They sealed behind her, and she walked calmly through the corridors of power, nodding to guards, exchanging pleasantries with passing nobles.

Only when she reached her own chambers, only when the privacy shields engaged and the surveillance countermeasures she had secretly installed hummed to life, did she allow the mask to fall.

Three rotations. Seventy-two hours by Earth's reckoning.

She moved to her hidden compartment, withdrawing the data chip that contained everything she had gathered: human languages, cultural archives, genetic sequences, survival protocols. Her fingers flew across her personal console, accessing the station's maintenance schedules, guard rotations, shuttle bay access codes.

There was a cargo pod scheduled for automated descent in eighteen hours—a supply drop for a research station that would soon be underwater. Its guidance system could be overridden. Its destination could be changed.

Inanna began to pack.

**Scene 5: Inanna retreats to her quarter...**

The door to Inanna's quarters sealed behind her with a whisper of compressed air, and she allowed herself exactly three seconds to lean against the cold metal surface, eyes closed, breathing through the tremor in her hands.

Three seconds. Then she straightened, smoothed the ceremonial silver fabric of her gown, and walked deeper into the chamber with measured steps.

*They're watching. They're always watching.*

The quarters befitting a princess of the First House stretched before her—a curved expanse of polished obsidian floors and walls that shifted between opacity and transparency at a thought. Currently, they showed the star field beyond the station, Earth hanging like a blue-green jewel in the lower quadrant of her vision. Beautiful. Doomed.

Inanna moved to her vanity station, a floating disc of brushed platinum that hummed with dormant technology. She sat gracefully, meeting her own reflection in the mirror's surface—dark eyes that revealed nothing, the ceremonial gold paint still marking her cheekbones and brow in the patterns of royal mourning. *Mourning for what?* they'd asked when she'd applied it. *For wisdom*, she'd answered, and they'd laughed, thinking it a joke.

Her fingers found the neural interface embedded in the vanity's edge, and she began the performance of evening ritual. Removing the pins from her elaborate coiffure. Wiping away the gold with a cloth that came away stained like old blood. All the while, her mind worked behind the mask of her face.

The surveillance systems in royal quarters were sophisticated but not infallible. She'd spent years learning their patterns, their blind spots, the precise frequency of their sweeps. Her grandmother had taught her that—old Antu, who understood that even princesses needed shadows to hide their secrets.

Inanna pressed her thumb to a hidden sensor beneath the vanity's lip. The mirror's surface flickered, then displayed what appeared to be a cosmetics inventory. But her eyes tracked the secondary data stream embedded in the color codes—the surveillance schedule, the guard rotations, the maintenance windows.

*Twenty-three minutes until the next sweep.*

She rose and crossed to the sleeping alcove, where gossamer curtains of woven light created the illusion of privacy. Her bed was a masterwork of Anunnaki engineering, a floating platform that adjusted to her body's every need. She'd always hated it. Too soft. Too accommodating. It made her feel like something being preserved rather than someone living.

Beneath the bed's hovering mass, invisible to casual inspection, a small panel responded to the specific bioelectric signature of her palm. It slid open with a sound like a held breath releasing.

The hidden compartment contained her true treasures: a data crystal no larger than her thumbnail, a protein synthesizer small enough to fit in her closed fist, and a knife. The knife was an antique, its blade forged from Nibiran steel before the Great Expansion, its handle wrapped in leather that had come from Earth itself—a gift from her mother on her naming day, centuries ago.

*"The blade remembers,"* Antu had said then, pressing it into her daughter's small hands. *"Even when we forget, the blade remembers what we were before we became gods."*

Inanna tucked the knife into the hidden sheath sewn into her sleeping shift, then inserted the data crystal into the neural port behind her ear. Information flooded her consciousness—restricted files she'd been collecting for decades, waiting for a moment she'd hoped would never come.

Earth's geography unfurled in her mind's eye. Mountain ranges and river systems. The locations of the labor camps and the wild zones beyond them. Climate patterns, predator distributions, plant species that could sustain Anunnaki physiology in emergency conditions. She'd gathered it all under the guise of academic interest, a princess's idle curiosity about the primitive world below.

*The Amazon Basin,* she thought, focusing on the vast green expanse that sprawled across the planet's midsection. Dense canopy, limited orbital visibility, abundant water sources. The humans who'd escaped into those jungles had survived for generations, evading the periodic purges. If they could hide there, so could she.

She pulled up the station's hangar manifest next, scrolling through the inventory of vessels. The royal barges were too conspicuous, too heavily monitored. The military cruisers required crew complements and authorization codes she couldn't fake. But there—a reconnaissance pod designated for atmospheric sampling, scheduled for routine maintenance in Bay Seventeen.

Bay Seventeen. Lightly staffed. A maintenance window in six hours that would leave only two technicians on duty.

Inanna memorized the pod's specifications, its fuel capacity, its atmospheric entry protocols. It was small, barely large enough for a single occupant, designed for short-range scientific missions. The journey to Earth's surface would push its capabilities to their limits.

*Good,* she thought grimly. *Let them think no one would be foolish enough to attempt it.*

A soft chime interrupted her planning—her private communication channel, the one known only to immediate family. Inanna's heart stuttered. Had her father decided to test her submission so soon? Had someone detected her access of restricted files?

She accepted the transmission with a thought, and her mother's sigil appeared in her visual field—the coiled serpent of House Antu, rendered in deep purple light.

No voice. No holographic image. Just text, stark and simple:

*The jungle remembers.*

Below it, a string of coordinates.

Inanna stared at the message, her throat tight. The coordinates resolved in her mind—a location deep in the Amazon, far from any known Anunnaki installation. Far from the flood zones that would soon swallow the coastal settlements. Far from the death her father had decreed.

How did her mother know? How long had Antu been watching, waiting, preparing for this moment?

The message dissolved, leaving no trace in the system logs. Inanna sat motionless on her bed, the weight of her mother's gift settling over her like armor.

*She knows. She's always known.*

Queen Antu, who smiled through state functions and played the role of dutiful consort with flawless precision. Who had given her daughter a knife and spoken of remembering. Who had, perhaps, been running her own quiet rebellion for longer than Inanna had been alive.

The coordinates burned in Inanna's memory, a beacon in the darkness ahead. She didn't know what she'd find there. Didn't know if her mother had sent her toward salvation or merely a more dignified death than drowning in the floods.

It didn't matter.

Inanna rose and began to change out of her ceremonial gown, replacing it with the close-fitting tactical suit she'd hidden in the back of her wardrobe. Dark fabric that would absorb light rather than reflect it. Boots with magnetic soles and impact-absorbing treads. A cloak with thermal masking woven into its fibers.

She looked at herself in the mirror—not a princess now, but something else. Something that had no name in the Anunnaki lexicon.

*Traitor,* her father would call her.
*Fool,* her brother would sneer.
*Dead,* the court would pronounce, once they realized she was gone.

But as she secured the knife against her thigh and slipped the protein synthesizer into her belt pouch, Inanna felt something she hadn't experienced in centuries. Not fear—she'd lived with fear for so long it had become background noise. Not hope—hope was too fragile a word for what stirred in her chest.

*Purpose.*

She had six hours until the maintenance window. Six hours to finalize her route through the station's corridors, to prepare the diversions that would draw attention away from Bay Seventeen, to say goodbye to everything she'd ever known.

Six hours until she became the first Anunnaki in recorded history to commit treason for the sake of creatures her people considered less than animals.

Inanna dimmed the lights in her quarters and lay down on the bed she'd always hated, forcing her body to rest even as her mind raced through contingencies and calculations. She would need her strength for what came next.

Above her, through the transparent ceiling, Earth turned slowly in the void—blue and green and white, heartbreakingly beautiful, utterly unaware of the death sentence that hung over it.

*The jungle remembers,* her mother had written.

Inanna closed her eyes and let the coordinates pulse behind her eyelids like a second heartbeat.

*Then let the jungle remember me too.*

**Scene 6: In the dead of the station's a...**

**Scene 6: In the dead of the station's artificial night cycle**

The corridor stretched before Inanna like a throat of darkness, swallowing the faint blue emergency lighting that pulsed along its ribbed walls. She pressed herself against the cold metal, her bare feet silent on the grated floor. The royal slippers she'd discarded three sections back—too soft, too likely to whisper against the steel.

*Breathe. Count. Move.*

She'd helped design these security protocols when she was barely past her first century, a princess playing at engineering while her tutors indulged her curiosity. Now that childhood game might save her life.

The scanner node ahead hummed with dormant energy, its crystalline eye cycling through spectral frequencies. Inanna counted the rhythm—three seconds of ultraviolet sweep, two seconds of thermal, one second of darkness as the system reset. She'd argued for eliminating that gap. Her father had called it an acceptable inefficiency.

*One. Two. Three.*

She slipped through the dead zone, her heart hammering against her ribs like something caged and desperate to escape.

The secondary hangar bay was a forgotten limb of the station, relegated to maintenance craft and emergency pods after the grand docking facilities were constructed on the station's sunward face. Dust motes drifted in the recycled air, catching the amber glow of standby lights. The space smelled of lubricant and old ozone—the scent of machines waiting to be remembered.

Inanna's eyes found the pod immediately. A Descent-class vessel, compact and unremarkable, designed for atmospheric entry rather than combat or comfort. Its hull bore the scratches of a hundred routine missions, its designation number half-worn away: *D-7.*

*My chariot to exile.*

She crossed the hangar floor in quick, measured steps, her stolen technician's jumpsuit rustling with each movement. The garment hung loose on her frame—she'd taken it from a storage locker, not daring to access her own quarters after the confrontation with her father.

*Accept your place in the empire, or face the consequences of treason.*

His words echoed in her skull, cold and final as a tomb door sealing shut.

The pod's access panel glowed to life at her touch, recognizing the genetic signature she couldn't hide. For a moment, Inanna froze, waiting for alarms, for guards, for the heavy hand of her uncle on her shoulder. Nothing came but the soft hiss of the hatch unsealing.

Inside, the cockpit embraced her with familiar geometry—control interfaces designed for Anunnaki hands, screens that flickered to life with eager luminescence. She slid into the pilot's cradle, her fingers dancing across the startup sequence with muscle memory she didn't know she possessed.

*Atmospheric processors: online.*
*Navigation systems: calibrating.*
*Descent trajectory: calculating.*

Earth hung in the viewport like a jewel suspended in void, its surface swirled with white and blue and the deep green of continents that would soon drown. From here, she could almost pretend it was simply beautiful—not a death sentence waiting to be executed.

"Forgive me," she whispered to no one, to everyone. To the billions of souls who didn't know they had days left to live. "I'm coming."

The launch sequence initiated with a subsonic thrum that vibrated through her bones. The hangar's emergency doors began their ponderous slide, revealing the star-scattered darkness beyond.

Then the alarms screamed.

Red light flooded the cockpit, strobing in rhythm with a klaxon that seemed to pierce directly into her brain. The hangar doors shuddered, their motion reversing as override commands flooded the system.

"Princess Inanna." The voice crackled through the pod's communication system, cold and unsurprised. "I must confess, I expected this hours ago. You've grown more patient than I credited."

Enlil.

Her blood turned to ice water in her veins. On the secondary display, she could see security forces flooding into the hangar, their weapons raised, their faces hidden behind tactical visors.

"Uncle." She forced her voice to remain steady, her hands never pausing in their work across the controls. "I didn't realize you cared enough to see me off personally."

"I care about the integrity of our mission." His tone carried no warmth, no familial recognition. "About the security of our people. You've always been sentimental, Inanna. It was charming when you were young. Now it's simply dangerous."

The hangar doors had stopped, half-open—a gap just wide enough for a skilled pilot, just narrow enough to be suicidal.

"You could let me go." She was bargaining now, buying seconds while the pod's engines built toward launch capacity. "Tell them I overpowered the guards, stole the vessel before you could respond. I'll disappear. You'll never have to explain my sympathies to the council."

"And allow contaminated bloodlines to pollute our genetic legacy?" Enlil's laugh was a harsh bark. "No, niece. You'll be returned to your father, and you'll watch from confinement as we cleanse that world. Perhaps then you'll understand why attachment to lesser species is a disease that must be purged."

The soldiers were at the pod now, magnetic clamps extending toward the hull. In moments, they would lock her in place, and everything—the warnings, the desperate hope, the faces of those human children she'd watched grow from orbit—would mean nothing.

*No.*

Inanna's hand slammed down on the emergency launch override.

The pod screamed forward, tearing free of the clamps with a shriek of protesting metal. The gap in the hangar doors rushed toward her, a sliver of salvation framed in steel. She felt the scrape of the hull against the door's edge, heard the groan of alloys never meant to touch, and then—

Silence. Stars. The infinite embrace of vacuum.

Behind her, the station dwindled, its lights angry and red, its pursuit craft already launching from the primary hangar. Ahead, Earth grew larger with each passing second, its atmosphere a thin blue line of promise and danger.

"You've made your choice, Inanna." Enlil's voice cut through the static, harder now, stripped of even the pretense of familial connection. "When we find you—and we will find you—you will face the full weight of Anunnaki justice. There will be no mercy. No recognition of blood. You are no longer a princess. You are simply a traitor."

She killed the communication link with a savage jab.

The pod shuddered as it caught the first whispers of atmosphere, heat building against the forward shields. Warning indicators flashed—damage from her desperate escape, systems operating beyond safe parameters. The craft wanted to shake itself apart, and Inanna fought the controls with every ounce of strength she possessed.

*Terror.* It coursed through her like electricity, primal and absolute. She was falling toward a world she'd only ever observed from safety, hunted by her own people, carrying knowledge that could save billions or damn her forever.

*Exhilaration.* She was free. For the first time in her centuries of existence, no protocol bound her, no expectation shaped her, no royal obligation weighed upon her shoulders. She was simply Inanna—falling, burning, choosing.

*Commitment.* There was no return now. The woman who had been a princess of the Anunnaki Empire died somewhere in the space between the station and the atmosphere. Whatever emerged from this fire would be something new, something forged in the crucible of betrayal and hope.

The pursuit craft appeared on her sensors, closing fast, their weapons systems charging. She had minutes at most before they achieved weapons lock.

But minutes were enough.

Earth's atmosphere wrapped around her pod like a lover's arms, and Inanna plunged toward the world she had chosen to save—or die trying to reach.

Behind her, the stars grew distant, and her old life burned away in trails of superheated plasma.
