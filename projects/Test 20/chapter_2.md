## Chapter 2: The Parade of Cages

**Scene 1: Bobby sits in a modified trans...**

# Scene 1: Bobby sits in a modified transport cage on a parade float

The confetti fell like snow, but wrong. Snow on the moon had been dust—ancient, patient, silent. This was paper and noise, a blizzard of human celebration that stuck to the reinforced glass of Bobby's cage in wet clumps.

Bobby sat perfectly still on his padded platform, his small hands resting on his knees. The space suit they'd dressed him in for the cameras was a replica, lighter than the real thing, with a helmet that locked at an angle that photographers had deemed "heroic." Through the curved visor, he watched Broadway become a tunnel of faces and flags, all of them screaming at him with their mouths stretched wide.

The float lurched forward. Someone had designed it to look like the lunar lander, complete with silver paneling and an American flag that snapped in the wind. Bobby's cage sat where the actual landing module would be, elevated so the crowds could see him better. So they could point and cheer and throw more paper that fell like broken promises.

"There he is! Bobby! Look at Bobby!"

The voices crashed against the glass in waves. Bobby had learned to count heartbeats during the centrifuge training—a way to survive the crushing pressure. He counted them now. Twelve beats between Handler Jenkins' practiced wave to the left crowd. Fifteen before Handler Rodriguez adjusted his position for the photographers jogging alongside the float.

"Get him to wave!" Jenkins shouted over the din, his smile never faltering. "Bobby! Wave! Remember? Like this!" He demonstrated, his hand flopping back and forth like a dying fish.

Bobby remembered. He remembered everything they'd taught him. Wave. Smile. Clap. Jump. Spin. A catalog of tricks that had once earned him apple slices and Jenkins' genuine laughter, back before Bobby understood what earning meant.

He didn't wave.

"Bobby, come on, buddy." Rodriguez moved closer to the cage, tapping the glass with his knuckle. Three sharp raps. "Wave for the people. They love you."

A camera flash exploded against Bobby's retina. Then another. Then a dozen more, a constellation of artificial stars that left purple ghosts floating in his vision. On the moon, he had seen Earth rise over the horizon—a blue marble suspended in perfect black. No one had told him to wave at Earth. No one had needed to. He had pressed his gloved hand against the window of the lander and held it there, feeling nothing through the layers of fabric and metal, but trying anyway.

"Maybe he's overwhelmed," Jenkins said, still waving, still smiling. "Poor little guy."

The float stopped. Bobby could see a platform ahead where important-looking humans stood behind a podium draped in red, white, and blue bunting. One of them held a golden key the size of Bobby's forearm. The Key to the City, Rodriguez had explained that morning while forcing Bobby's arms through the suit sleeves. An honor. A symbol.

More symbols. More things that meant something to everyone except Bobby.

"Alright, when we get up there, you're going to hand Bobby to Mayor Richardson," Jenkins was saying to Rodriguez. "Make sure his face is toward the cameras. And for God's sake, see if you can get him to do something. Anything."

Rodriguez unlatched the cage door. The noise of the crowd tripled, quadrupled, became a physical thing that pressed against Bobby's eardrums. Hands reached for him—Rodriguez's hands, familiar but not kind, just efficient—and lifted him out into the chaos.

The confetti was everywhere now, sticking to his suit, catching in the small gap between his helmet and collar. A piece landed on his nose, pink and wet. Bobby's eyes tracked it as it slid down, following gravity the way things were supposed to fall. Not like on the moon, where he'd released a bolt during the equipment check and watched it hover, then drift, then finally settle in a way that made his chest feel too small for his lungs.

"Ladies and gentlemen, the hero of the hour—Bobby the space chimp!"

The mayor's voice boomed through speakers. Rodriguez held Bobby up like a trophy, turning him slowly so every camera could get its shot. Bobby saw his own image reflected in a hundred phone screens, a thousand eyes behind them, all looking at him and seeing something that wasn't there.

He thought about the moon's silence. How it had pressed against the lander's hull like a living thing, patient and vast. How he had floated in it for three days, the only sound his own breathing and the occasional crackle of Houston's transmissions. How he had looked out at the stars—not through glass, not through atmosphere, but at them directly for the first time—and understood with sudden, crushing clarity that he was very far from home.

But which home? The facility where he'd been born? The training center with its centrifuges and simulators? Or some other place, some jungle he'd never seen, where chimps lived in trees instead of cages and no one asked them to wave?

"Can you get him to salute?" the mayor whispered to Rodriguez.

Rodriguez shifted Bobby in his arms, trying to manipulate his right hand into position. Bobby let his arm go limp. Not defiant—he had learned long ago that defiance earned punishment. Just absent. His body present, his self somewhere else. Somewhere quiet.

The crowd loved it anyway. They cheered louder, mistaking his stillness for humility, his silence for dignity. Bobby watched them through the helmet's visor and counted heartbeats. The parade would end eventually. The noise would stop. They would return him to his habitat, to his actual cage, and someone would remove the suit and give him his evening meal and expect him to be grateful.

Another flash. Another cheer. Another moment of being seen without being understood.

Bobby closed his eyes and remembered the moon, where no one had asked him to be anything but what he was: a small creature, very far from home, looking up at the stars and finally—finally—seeing them clearly.

**Scene 2: At a NASA press conference, Bo...**

**Scene 2: At a NASA press conference, Bobby is displayed in his space suit while scientists and administrators field questions about the mission's success**

The camera flashes hit Bobby's eyes like small explosions, each one leaving purple afterimages that swam across his vision. He sat on the elevated platform in his modified space suit—the one they'd cleaned three times to remove the smell of his own fear from the capsule—while Handler Jenkins stood just off to his right, one hand resting possessively on the back of Bobby's chair.

The press conference room at NASA headquarters smelled of coffee, cologne, and something Bobby had learned to recognize as ambition. Rows of reporters filled the tiered seating, their cameras clicking like a swarm of mechanical insects. At the podium, Dr. Marcus Webb gestured expansively, his silver hair catching the lights as he spoke about "unprecedented achievement" and "the dawn of a new era in space exploration."

Bobby's suit was too tight around the neck. It had been adjusted for the mission profile—for zero gravity and capsule confines—not for sitting under hot lights while humans congratulated themselves. He lifted one hand to the collar, fingers searching for the seal release.

"No, no, buddy," Jenkins murmured, catching Bobby's wrist with practiced gentleness. "Keep it on for the photos. Just a little longer."

Bobby's hand fell to his lap. He studied the crowd instead, searching for something he couldn't name. The faces all looked the same—eager, hungry, their mouths moving with questions he could hear but not understand. Not fully. He knew some words now. "Good boy." "Mission." "Success." "Hero."

He wasn't sure he knew what "hero" meant, but he knew what it felt like when they said it. It felt like the cage door locking.

"Dr. Webb," a woman in the front row stood, her voice cutting through the murmur. "Can you speak to Bobby's cognitive state during the mission? Did he demonstrate problem-solving capabilities beyond his training?"

Webb smiled, the expression that Bobby recognized as the one that meant someone was about to say things about him while looking through him. "Bobby performed every task exactly as trained. His success is a testament to our behavioral conditioning program—"

Bobby's hands moved before he could stop them. The signs came naturally, muscle memory from hundreds of sessions with the graduate students who used to visit before the mission. *Sky. Different. See.*

His fingers shaped the words with precision, the way Dr. Reeves had taught him. *Sky different see sky—*

A treat appeared in front of his face. Banana, his favorite, held in Jenkins's steady hand. "Good boy, Bobby. Such a good boy."

Bobby's hands froze mid-sign. The banana's smell filled his nostrils, sweet and cloying. His stomach responded even as his mind recoiled. He took the banana because that's what he did. That's what he'd always done.

"As you can see," Jenkins said smoothly to the crowd, his voice carrying the practiced warmth of a man who'd given this speech before, "Bobby's still adjusting to being back. The mission was demanding, and we're monitoring him carefully for any signs of stress or disorientation. It's normal for him to exhibit some unusual behaviors during this transition period."

*Not unusual,* Bobby thought, but he had no sign for that. No sign for the thing that pressed against the inside of his chest, the thing he'd brought back from the black. He looked at his hands—the same hands that had pulled the lever, that had floated in darkness, that had touched something beyond the blue curve of home.

"Next question," Webb said, pointing to a man in the third row.

"Is there any plan for a follow-up mission? Will Bobby return to space?"

Bobby's head snapped up. *Return.* He knew that word. His hands moved again, faster now, more urgent. *No. Sky different. See different. They—*

"Here we go, champ." Jenkins produced another treat, but this time Bobby pushed it away. His handler's smile tightened almost imperceptibly. The hand on Bobby's shoulder increased its pressure, just slightly. A reminder. A warning.

Bobby's hands continued to move. *See. They. Above. Watching. They—*

"Bobby's doing great," Jenkins said loudly, standing now, positioning his body between Bobby and the cameras. "But I think he's had enough excitement for one day. The lights and noise can be overwhelming."

"Just one more question—"

"That's all the time we have with our star astronaut," Webb interjected, his tone brooking no argument. "Bobby needs his rest. We'll have more opportunities for photos after the medical briefing."

The reporters surged forward anyway, cameras raised, questions overlapping into a wall of sound. Bobby's hands kept moving, signing to anyone who might understand, but Jenkins was already guiding him off the platform, one firm hand on his back, steering him toward the side exit.

At the back of the room, Dr. Sarah Chen lowered her tablet, her stylus hovering over the notes she'd been taking. She'd been assigned to monitor Bobby's "behavioral adjustment" three days ago, handed a file full of baseline data and expected protocols. But what she'd just witnessed didn't match the profile of a stressed animal seeking comfort.

Those hand movements had been deliberate. Sequential. Repeated with increasing urgency when interrupted.

She rewound the video on her tablet, watching Bobby's hands frame by frame. She'd studied ASL in graduate school—a minor requirement for her primatology degree that she'd never expected to use. The signs were rudimentary, probably taught through basic conditioning, but they were clear enough.

*Sky. Different. See. They. Above. Watching.*

Sarah's pen tapped against her teeth as she watched Jenkins guide Bobby through the exit, the chimp's hands still moving even as the door closed behind them. The official report would note "agitation" and "adjustment difficulty." It would recommend increased enrichment activities and possibly mild sedation for future public appearances.

But Sarah had seen something else in Bobby's eyes when he'd pushed that banana away. She'd seen frustration. She'd seen purpose.

She'd seen someone trying desperately to tell a story that no one wanted to hear.

The press conference dissolved into smaller conversations, reporters clustering around Webb and the other NASA officials. Sarah remained in her seat, watching the video loop again and again, Bobby's hands forming words that everyone had seen but no one had read.

*They. Above. Watching.*

Sarah closed her tablet and stood, gathering her materials. She had a report to file, observations to document. But first, she needed to see Bobby's full training records—not just the sanitized version they'd given her, but everything. Every session, every sign he'd been taught, every vocabulary word in his limited lexicon.

Because if she was right, if those movements meant what she thought they meant, then Bobby wasn't having an adjustment period.

He was trying to tell them something.

And whatever it was, it terrified him enough to risk refusing a banana.

**Scene 3: In his habitat at the research...**

**Scene 3: In his habitat at the research facility**

The observation room smelled of stale coffee and the particular antiseptic that maintenance used on Tuesdays. Sarah Chen pressed her palm against the one-way glass, feeling the coolness through her skin as she watched Bobby sit motionless in the center of his enclosure.

He'd been in that exact position for forty-seven minutes.

"This is concerning." Dr. Richard Kowalski appeared beside her, tablet in hand, his reflection ghosting over Bobby's still form. "Day twelve of behavioral regression. We're looking at significant deterioration of acquired skills."

Through the glass, Bobby's habitat sprawled in careful simulation of enrichment—climbing structures painted cheerful primary colors, puzzle feeders dangling from artificial branches, a tire swing that hadn't moved in days. The morning sun slanted through the skylight, illuminating dust motes that drifted past Bobby's face. He didn't blink.

"Has he eaten?" Sarah asked, though she already knew the answer from her morning review of the logs.

"Minimal intake. Jenkins had to hand-feed him last night." Kowalski swiped through screens on his tablet. "Muscle tone is declining. He's not even using the climbing apparatus. Before the mission, he'd complete the vertical maze in under two minutes. Now he won't touch it."

Sarah made a note in her own tablet, stylus moving in quick strokes. *Subject maintains alert posture despite stillness. Eyes tracking movement outside habitat. Breathing steady, non-distressed.*

"Maybe he doesn't want to," she said quietly.

"Want to?" Kowalski's eyebrows rose. "Sarah, he's a research animal experiencing post-mission trauma. We don't frame this in terms of volition."

Handler Jenkins entered the habitat through the keeper door, carrying Bobby's favorite enrichment toy—a clear plastic sphere that dispensed treats when manipulated correctly. Bobby had once solved it in seconds, his clever fingers working the mechanisms with what looked like joy. Jenkins had been with Bobby since the beginning, and the affection in his weathered face was genuine.

"Hey there, Bobby boy," Jenkins said, his voice carrying that particular tone handlers used—warm, slightly elevated, encouraging. "Look what I brought you."

Bobby's eyes shifted. Tracked Jenkins's approach. Nothing else moved.

Jenkins knelt a few feet away, demonstrating the toy's mechanism. A grape appeared in the dispensing slot. "Remember this one? You love this one. Come on, buddy."

The silence stretched. A ventilation fan hummed. Somewhere down the corridor, another primate vocalized—a brief whoop that echoed and died.

Bobby looked at the toy. Looked at Jenkins. Then, with deliberate slowness, turned his head away.

"Jesus," Kowalski muttered. "That's the third refusal today. We need to consider intervention. Anti-anxiety medication, maybe adjust his environment, introduce a companion—"

"Wait." Sarah leaned closer to the glass. "Look at how he's refusing."

"What do you mean 'how'? He's not engaging. That's the problem."

But Sarah was watching the precision of Bobby's movements. The way he'd made eye contact first, acknowledged the toy, acknowledged Jenkins. Then the deliberate turn. Not the vacant withdrawal of depression. Not the agitation of stress. Something else entirely.

Inside the habitat, Jenkins tried again, rolling the toy closer. It bumped against Bobby's foot.

Bobby reached down. Sarah felt Kowalski tense beside her in anticipation.

Bobby picked up the toy. Held it for a long moment, turning it in his hands with the dexterity that had made him the perfect candidate for manipulating spacecraft controls. Then, maintaining eye contact with Jenkins, he set it down carefully to his left and folded his hands in his lap.

"That's not regression," Sarah said.

"Then what would you call it?"

She watched Bobby, watched the intelligence moving behind those eyes that had seen Earth from space, that had floated in the void between worlds. He sat like a statue, like a monk, like something that had made a decision and would not be moved.

"Refusal," she said. "Conscious, deliberate refusal."

Kowalski made a dismissive sound. "You're anthropomorphizing. Projecting human intentionality onto stress behaviors."

"Am I?" Sarah pulled up her files, days of observations. "Day eight, he stopped performing the lever-press sequence—but only after completing it once perfectly, as if to show he remembered. Day nine, he signed 'no' seventeen times when presented with the flight simulator. Day ten—"

"The sign for 'no' could indicate anything. Discomfort, confusion—"

"Seventeen times, Richard. In response to seventeen different requests. That's not confusion."

Through the glass, Jenkins stood slowly, the defeat evident in his shoulders. He left the toy where Bobby had placed it—a small plastic sphere full of treats that might as well have been a grenade for all the interest Bobby showed.

As Jenkins reached the keeper door, Bobby moved for the first time in nearly an hour. His hand rose, fingers forming a shape Sarah recognized from the limited sign vocabulary he'd been taught.

*Finished.*

Not 'no.' Not 'stop.' *Finished.*

Jenkins paused, turned back. "What do you mean, finished?"

Bobby's hand remained raised, the sign clear and deliberate. Then he lowered it and returned to his stillness, a breathing statue in a cage full of toys.

"We need to schedule a full neurological workup," Kowalski said, already typing. "MRI, blood panel, cognitive assessment battery. If there's damage from the mission—radiation exposure, oxygen deprivation during reentry—we need to identify it before the next launch."

"The next launch," Sarah repeated softly.

"Of course. We have three more missions scheduled. Bobby's the most trained chimp in the program. Once we resolve this behavioral episode—"

"What if it's not an episode?" Sarah kept her eyes on Bobby, on the profound stillness of him. "What if he's trying to tell us something?"

"Then he should use the communication tools we've given him."

"Maybe he is." Sarah pulled up the video footage from the past twelve days, the accumulated hours of Bobby's refusals. "And maybe we're not listening."

Kowalski's tablet chimed—another meeting, another briefing. The machine of the space program ground on, indifferent to the silence of one small primate. "Document everything," he said. "I want daily reports. We'll reconvene Thursday to discuss intervention protocols."

He left, his footsteps receding down the corridor.

Sarah remained at the glass. Inside the habitat, Bobby sat in his square of sunlight, surrounded by the apparatus of enrichment, the mechanisms of care, the instruments of their good intentions. A research assistant appeared with Bobby's lunch—fresh fruit, vegetables, protein supplements calculated to the gram. She placed the tray in the feeding area and retreated.

Bobby didn't move.

Sarah pressed her forehead against the cool glass. "What did you see up there?" she whispered.

For just a moment, Bobby's eyes met hers through the one-way mirror. It should have been impossible—he shouldn't have been able to see her through the observation glass. But his gaze found hers with uncanny precision, and in it, Sarah saw something that made her breath catch.

Not vacancy. Not trauma.

Recognition.

Then Bobby closed his eyes, and the moment passed, leaving Sarah with only her notes and her growing certainty that everyone else was asking the wrong questions.

She began to type: *Day 12: Subject demonstrates consistent pattern of selective engagement. Refusals appear purposeful rather than pathological. Recommend alternative interpretive framework.*

Through the glass, Bobby sat motionless as a stone buddha, and the uneaten fruit began to brown in the artificial light.

**Scene 4: During a magazine photo shoot ...**

The photography studio blazed with white heat. Three umbrella lights surrounded the set like artificial suns, their intensity making Bobby's eyes water. The air conditioning couldn't keep pace with the equipment, and the room smelled of hot metal, hairspray, and something chemical that made his nostrils flare.

"Tilt his head more to the left. No, *his* left. Jesus Christ." The photographer, a thin man with a goatee who kept his eye pressed to the camera like it was surgically attached, waved impatiently without looking up.

Rodriguez adjusted Bobby's helmet, the same one he'd worn during the mission. They'd cleaned it since then, but Bobby could still smell traces of his own fear-sweat embedded in the padding. The handler's fingers were gentle but insistent, positioning Bobby's skull at the precise angle demanded.

"Perfect. Hold that." The photographer's camera clicked like an insect. Click-click-click-click.

Bobby held it. Not because they asked, but because stillness required less energy than resistance. He'd learned that in the centrifuge, in the isolation chamber, in every training session that pushed his body past what it wanted to give. Stillness was its own kind of power.

"Can we get the smile? We need the smile." The art director, a woman in black-framed glasses and a pencil skirt, consulted her clipboard. "The readers want to see America's hero happy."

Rodriguez produced a small piece of apple from his pocket. He held it just above Bobby's eyeline, making kissing noises. "Come on, Bobby. Big smile for the nice people. You remember how."

Bobby looked at the apple. Then at Rodriguez. Then back at the apple.

He didn't smile.

"Maybe the makeup's too heavy?" The makeup artist, who'd spent twenty minutes dabbing foundation on Bobby's face to reduce shine, stepped forward nervously. "I could powder him down more—"

"It's not the goddamn makeup, Sheila." The photographer straightened from his camera, rubbing his eye. "The chimp's just not cooperating."

"He's not a chimp, he's a chimpanzee," Rodriguez said automatically, though his voice carried no conviction. "And he's probably tired. We've been at this for ninety minutes."

"Sinatra doesn't get tired. Marilyn doesn't get tired." The art director made a sharp notation on her clipboard. "We have a deadline. *Life Magazine* doesn't hold the presses for anyone, even if they've been to space."

The photographer circled the set, examining Bobby from different angles. "What about the wave? The famous wave from the mission footage. Can he do that?"

Rodriguez's face brightened. "The moon wave. Yeah, he knows that one. We practiced it a thousand times." He moved to stand beside the camera, demonstrating the gesture—right arm raised, hand rotating at the wrist in that slow, deliberate motion that had captivated millions on their television screens.

"Bobby. Wave. Come on, buddy. Show them the wave."

Bobby sat motionless on the stool they'd positioned him on. The studio lights made his space suit uncomfortably warm. Sweat gathered under his arms, in the creases behind his knees. The suit was a replica—lighter than the real one, made for photographs rather than the vacuum of space—but it still constrained him in familiar ways.

Rodriguez repeated the gesture, more emphatically. "Wave, Bobby. *Wave.*"

The handlers had taught him this sign when he was three years old. Raise arm. Rotate wrist. Receive reward. A simple exchange, performed thousands of times until it became muscle memory. During the mission, when the camera light blinked red, he'd executed it perfectly. That wave had appeared on the covers of newspapers in seventeen countries.

Bobby understood what they wanted. He simply chose not to give it.

"Maybe if we—" The makeup artist reached toward Bobby with a powder puff.

He turned his head away, not aggressive, just definitive. The motion dislodged his helmet slightly.

"Dammit." Rodriguez moved in to readjust it. "Bobby, come on. This isn't like you. You love performing. You love the attention."

Did he? Bobby couldn't remember loving it. He remembered the rewards that followed compliance—the fruit, the praise, the brief respite from training. But love? That was a word they used, not him.

The photographer lowered his camera completely. "Is he sick? Should we reschedule?"

"He's not sick." Rodriguez's jaw tightened. "He's being stubborn."

"Well, can you un-stubborn him? We've got three more setups after this."

Rodriguez pulled out his full arsenal—apple slices, grapes, a small plastic astronaut toy that Bobby had once enjoyed. He made the signs for "good," "please," "friend." His voice cycled through encouraging, commanding, pleading.

Bobby watched it all with dark, unblinking eyes.

The art director checked her watch. "We're burning money standing here. Can we at least get some shots of him looking heroic? Chin up, eyes forward, that sort of thing?"

"Position him however you want." The photographer returned to his camera with obvious frustration. "Apparently, that's all we're getting."

They moved Bobby like furniture. Turned his shoulders. Adjusted his posture. Tilted his chin toward the lights until his eyes watered from the glare. Through it all, he remained passive, neither helping nor hindering. His face held no expression they could market.

Click-click-click-click.

"These are going to be terrible," the photographer muttered. "He looks like a goddamn hostage."

"Work with what we have," the art director said. "Retouching can fix a lot."

Rodriguez stood to the side, arms crossed, watching Bobby with an expression that mixed confusion and something else—something that might have been the first glimmer of uncertainty. "I don't understand," he said quietly. "He's never refused like this before."

Bobby met his handler's eyes. In that moment, he willed Rodriguez to see what he was doing, to understand that this stillness was not failure but message. *I will not perform. I will not pretend. I will not wave at cameras while you celebrate what you did to me.*

But Rodriguez only saw a chimpanzee having a bad day.

"Let's break for lunch," the art director announced. "Maybe food will improve his mood."

They removed Bobby's helmet and led him to a small holding area behind the set—another cage, this one with folding chairs and a card table. Someone brought him orange slices and a bottle of water. The handlers talked in low voices, discussing strategies, motivation, whether the mission had somehow damaged him.

Bobby ate the oranges slowly, methodically. Through the doorway, he could see the photography set with its lights and camera and empty stool, waiting for him to return and be what they needed him to be.

He took another piece of orange. Chewed. Swallowed.

And decided, with absolute clarity, that he would not wave for them again.

Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever.

**Scene 5: Late at night, Dr. Sarah Chen ...**

The fluorescent lights hummed their monotonous song above Sarah Chen's desk, the only sound in the research facility at 2:47 AM. She'd sent the cleaning crew away an hour ago. The coffee in her NASA mug had gone cold, a film forming across its surface like ice on a winter pond.

On her left monitor: Bobby on the moon, the footage the networks had played a thousand times. On her right: Bobby from this afternoon, recorded by the habitat's observation cameras.

Sarah clicked back to the lunar footage. Thirty seconds. That's how long Bobby had stood still on the lunar surface before Houston had started barking commands through the suit's speakers. She'd watched the press conference footage a dozen times, always focused on the handlers, the spectacle, the manufactured triumph. But now she isolated just Bobby. Zoomed in on his helmet, on what little she could see of his face through the gold-tinted visor.

His head had tilted upward. Not in the scanning pattern they'd trained—left, right, assess, proceed. This was different. A sustained gaze at something above him. At nothing, according to the mission parameters. At empty space.

She toggled to today's footage. Bobby sat in the corner of his enclosure, the expensive one they'd built for their returning hero, complete with climbing structures he never used and puzzle feeders he ignored. The time stamp read 14:23:17. She let it play. Fourteen minutes passed. Bobby didn't move. His breathing was even, visible in the slight rise and fall of his chest. His eyes were open.

His head was tilted at the same angle.

Sarah felt something cold trace down her spine—not fear, but recognition. The sensation she'd had twice before in her career: once watching dolphins manipulate their trainers into giving them fish by feigning inability, and once observing an orangutan pick a lock then carefully relock it to avoid detection. The moment when the research subject revealed depths the researcher hadn't anticipated.

She pulled up Dr. Morrison's assessment from the file on her desk: *"Subject exhibits classic signs of post-mission depression and potential PTSD. Recommend increased enrichment activities and possible pharmaceutical intervention if condition persists."*

Sarah created a new document. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, then began typing:

*Observation Log - Dr. S. Chen - Confidential*

*The prevailing interpretation of Subject B's behavioral changes assumes pathology. But what if we're witnessing something else entirely? What if Bobby isn't broken—what if he's choosing?*

She paused, aware she was stepping onto dangerous ground. Attributing choice to an animal subject opened doors the program would rather keep sealed. Choice implied agency. Agency implied rights. Rights implied...

Her phone buzzed. A text from Dr. Morrison: *Still there? Go home, Sarah. He's just depressed. We've seen it before.*

She didn't respond. Instead, she pulled up more footage, scrolling back through the weeks since Bobby's return. There—the moment during the photo shoot when Bobby had raised his hand in the sign for "finished," and the photographer had laughed, thinking he was waving. There—during the medical exam when he'd signed "hurt" while pointing at his chest, and Dr. Morrison had checked his cardiovascular function, finding nothing wrong. There—in the habitat when he'd signed "where" repeatedly, and the handlers had given him his favorite treats, assuming he wanted something.

Sarah began transcribing every sign Bobby had made in the past three weeks, cross-referencing them with the American Sign Language database the program had used for his training. The pattern emerged like stars appearing at dusk—one by one, then suddenly overwhelming.

Bobby wasn't asking where something was. He was asking *where* in the existential sense. The same sign, different context. A question without an object.

She pulled up the lunar footage again, frame by frame this time. Bobby's hand had moved during those thirty seconds. Just once, partially obscured by his suit. She enhanced the image, adjusted the contrast. His gloved fingers had formed a shape.

"Big," she whispered, recognizing the sign. But his other hand had moved too, completing a compound sign they'd never taught him. Big-all. Everything-big. Or perhaps: infinite.

Sarah's hands were shaking now. She typed faster:

*Subject B is not exhibiting dysfunction. He is attempting to communicate an experience for which he has insufficient vocabulary. His stillness is not catatonia—it's contemplation. His refusal to perform is not obstinance—it's rejection of a paradigm that no longer fits his understanding of himself.*

Outside her window, the first hint of dawn grayed the eastern sky. Sarah pulled out the observation schedule for the next week. Dr. Morrison had Bobby slated for "re-engagement therapy"—essentially forcing him through his old routines until compliance returned.

She picked up her phone, then set it down again. Who would she call? Who would believe that a chimpanzee had experienced something profound enough to fundamentally alter his relationship with his captors? Who would accept that Bobby's silence spoke louder than his previous performances ever had?

Sarah looked at the dual monitors again. Moon-Bobby and Earth-Bobby, separated by time and space but united in that same quality of presence. Of witnessing. Of being utterly, completely *there* in a way that transcended training and conditioning.

She saved her observations to a private folder, then created a second copy on a USB drive that she slipped into her pocket. Some instinct told her these notes might need protection.

As she finally shut down her computer, Sarah caught her own reflection in the darkened screen. Behind her, visible through the office window, she could see the lights of Bobby's habitat. Even from here, she could make out his silhouette in the corner, still as stone, head tilted toward a sky he could no longer see.

"What did you find up there?" she whispered to the empty office.

The fluorescent lights hummed on, indifferent to the question. But Sarah Chen had spent fifteen years learning to read what animals couldn't say. And for the first time in her career, she suspected the answer mattered more than she could possibly understand.

She grabbed her coat and headed for the door, but paused with her hand on the light switch. On impulse, she returned to her desk and added one final line to her observation log:

*Recommendation: Stop trying to fix Bobby. Start trying to listen.*

The lights went dark. In the distance, through layers of glass and steel, Bobby sat in his corner, perfectly still, remembering the weight of nothing and the sight of everything, waiting for someone to ask the right question.

**Scene 6: Handlers attempt to begin trai...**

**Scene 6: Handlers attempt to begin training Bobby for a proposed second lunar mission**

The training facility smelled the same as it always had—disinfectant, rubber mats, the faint metallic tang of the equipment. Bobby sat in the center of the room on a blue platform he'd known since he was three years old. The overhead lights hummed their familiar frequency. Everything was designed to be familiar, comfortable, predictable.

Handler Jenkins crouched before him, holding up the yellow ball. "Retrieve," he said, his voice carrying that particular brightness handlers used when they wanted something. "Come on, Bobby. You love this one."

Bobby looked at the ball. He knew what it was. He knew what Jenkins wanted. He'd performed this action approximately four thousand, two hundred times in his life. His muscles remembered the movement pattern—the reach, the grasp, the return, the placement in Jenkins's waiting hand.

He didn't move.

"Bobby. Retrieve." Jenkins rolled the ball closer, until it touched Bobby's foot.

Sarah Chen stood in the observation booth, her tablet recording everything. Through the one-way glass, she watched Bobby's face. His eyes tracked the ball's movement with perfect clarity. This wasn't incomprehension. This was something else.

"Jesus Christ," Handler Rodriguez muttered, checking his clipboard. "He's done this trick since he was a baby. It's practically reflexive."

Dr. Kowalski leaned forward in his chair, fingers steepled. "Perhaps the neural damage from cosmic radiation was more extensive than we thought. We should schedule another MRI—"

"His cognitive function tests are perfect," Sarah said quietly, not looking away from Bobby. "Better than perfect, actually. He scored higher on the pattern recognition assessment than he did pre-mission."

In the training room, Jenkins's professional smile was beginning to crack. He picked up the ball and placed it directly in Bobby's hand. "Hold. Good boy, hold the ball."

Bobby's fingers opened. The ball dropped to the mat with a soft thud and rolled away.

Jenkins stood up, exhaling through his nose. He walked to the equipment wall and returned with the ladder apparatus—a graduated climbing structure Bobby had mastered at age two. "All right. Let's try something simpler. Climb. Bobby, climb."

Bobby looked at the ladder. The aluminum rungs caught the fluorescent light. He'd climbed this structure so many times he could do it in his sleep. Had done it in his sleep, during the mission simulations, muscle memory carrying him through the motions while his mind floated elsewhere.

He remained seated.

"Bobby." Jenkins's voice carried an edge now. "Climb. Now."

Rodriguez stepped forward with a piece of apple, Bobby's favorite. "Come on, buddy. Just one climb and you get the treat. Easy."

The apple's scent reached Bobby clearly. His mouth didn't water. His hand didn't extend. He sat with his arms resting on his knees, breathing steadily, watching them watch him.

"This is ridiculous," Jenkins said, turning to the observation window. "He's being deliberately stubborn. We need to reestablish the behavioral protocols before he forgets his entire training."

Through the speaker, Dr. Kowalski's voice crackled: "Increase the reward value. Try the mango."

Rodriguez retrieved a piece of mango from the refrigeration unit, the fruit releasing its sweet, tropical scent into the sterile air. He held it up, letting Bobby see it clearly. "Mango, Bobby. Your favorite. Just climb the ladder. Three rungs. That's all."

Bobby's nostrils flared slightly, processing the smell. His gaze moved from the mango to Rodriguez's face, then to Jenkins, then to the mirrored observation window. Sarah felt the weight of that look even through the glass, as if Bobby could see directly through to where she stood.

He signed slowly, deliberately: *NO.*

"He's signing," Rodriguez said, surprised. "Did you see that? He signed 'no.'"

Jenkins waved it off. "He signs 'no' to broccoli. It doesn't mean anything. It's not actual communication." He moved closer to Bobby, his shadow falling across the chimp's smaller form. "Bobby, listen to me. We have work to do. Important work. The President wants you for the second mission. Everyone's counting on you."

Bobby signed again: *NO. FINISHED.*

"You don't get to decide when you're finished," Jenkins said, his voice rising. "You're not some—you're a research animal. You have a job. You do what we trained you to do."

The room seemed to contract around those words. Sarah saw Bobby's shoulders shift, saw something change in the set of his spine.

"Jenkins," Rodriguez said quietly. "Maybe we should take a break—"

"No. No more breaks. No more accommodations." Jenkins picked up the ball again, thrust it toward Bobby. "Retrieve. Now. That's an order, Bobby. RETRIEVE."

His voice echoed off the concrete walls. The equipment rattled slightly. In the observation booth, Sarah's hand moved toward the intercom button, though she wasn't sure what she would say.

Bobby looked at Jenkins for a long moment. Then, with perfect deliberation, he closed his eyes.

"Don't you dare," Jenkins said. "Don't you—Bobby, open your eyes. Open your eyes right now."

Bobby's breathing slowed. His body settled into absolute stillness, the kind of stillness that comes not from sleep but from profound, conscious withdrawal. His hands rested gently on his knees. His face smoothed into an expression of such complete neutrality that it seemed almost inhuman—or perhaps, Sarah thought, more human than anything she'd seen from him before.

"Bobby!" Jenkins's voice cracked. He looked at the ball in his hand, then threw it across the room where it bounced off the padded wall. "Goddammit. BOBBY!"

Nothing. Not a flinch. Not a flicker. Bobby sat like a statue, like a monument, like something carved from stone and placed in the center of the room as a rebuke to everything around it.

Rodriguez backed up a step. "Jesus. He's—is he even breathing?"

"Of course he's breathing," Jenkins snapped, but Sarah noticed he didn't move closer to check.

Dr. Kowalski's voice came through the speaker, uncertain for the first time: "Perhaps we should... this may be a dissociative episode. We should probably—"

"He's not dissociating," Sarah said, her voice cutting through the speculation. She was still watching Bobby's face, that profound stillness. "He's refusing."

"That's absurd," Kowalski said. "Chimps don't have the cognitive framework for—"

"Look at him." Sarah pressed closer to the glass. "Really look at him. That's not trauma. That's not dysfunction. That's a choice."

In the training room, Jenkins had gone very quiet. He stood three feet from Bobby, staring at the motionless chimp. When he spoke again, his voice had lost all its professional brightness, replaced by something raw and almost frightened.

"What do you want?" he whispered. "What the hell do you want from us?"

Bobby didn't open his eyes. Didn't sign. Didn't move.

The silence stretched out, filling the room like water, rising until everyone in it felt the pressure in their chests. The equipment hummed. The lights buzzed. Bobby breathed, slow and even, present and absent at the same time.

Sarah's tablet recorded it all: the time stamp, the refusal, the moment when a chimpanzee who had traveled to the moon and back decided that the greatest distance he could travel was inward, to a place none of them could follow.

After seventeen minutes—Sarah watched the counter tick by—Rodriguez finally broke. "We should call it for today. He's clearly not in the right state for—"

"Fine." Jenkins's voice was hollow. He set down the equipment he'd been holding and walked toward the door, then stopped. Without turning back, he said: "You know what scares me? I've worked with him for six years. I thought I knew him. Every signal, every response. But right now, sitting there like that..." He shook his head. "I don't know what he is."

The door sealed behind him with a pneumatic hiss.

Rodriguez lingered a moment longer, looking at Bobby with something like sadness. "I'll prep the transport back to his habitat," he said to no one in particular, and followed Jenkins out.

In the observation booth, Dr. Kowalski was already making notes, his voice clinical as he dictated into his recorder: "Subject exhibits catatonic-like behavior, possible psychological breakdown, recommend full neurological workup..."

But Sarah wasn't listening. She was watching Bobby, still motionless in the center of the empty training room. And as
