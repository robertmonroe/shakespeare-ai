## Chapter 4: Flight and Fire

**Scene 1: Inanna navigates through the orbital corridors**

The maintenance cycle had begun seventeen minutes ago. Inanna counted each second like a heartbeat, her internal chronometer synced to the station's rhythms as intimately as her own pulse.

The corridor stretched before her, bathed in the amber glow of reduced power mode. Every third lighting panel had dimmed to conservation levels, casting long shadows across the burnished walls that seemed to breathe with the station's mechanical respiration. The air recyclers hummed at half capacity—a low, drowsy frequency that vibrated through the deck plating beneath her feet.

She walked with purpose, but not haste. Haste drew eyes.

Her ceremonial robes had been exchanged for a technician's utilitarian jumpsuit, the fabric a dull silver that absorbed the amber light rather than reflecting it. The garment hung loose on her frame, designed for the broader shoulders of the engineering caste, but it served its purpose. From a distance, in this light, she was simply another worker attending to routine tasks.

The weight of the access cylinder pressed against her thigh through the hidden pocket she'd sewn into the suit's lining three cycles ago. Royal clearance codes. Her father's codes, technically—duplicated during a moment of distraction when he'd been reviewing fleet deployments and she'd been playing the role of dutiful daughter, bringing him fermented nectar and asking innocent questions about Earth's mineral yields.

*Treason*, whispered a voice in her mind that sounded remarkably like Enlil's cold rasp. *What you carry is treason.*

She silenced it with a memory: the holographic projection of Earth's projected timeline, the cascading failures mapped in crimson fractals across the planet's surface. Ninety-three cycles. That was all the time the primitives had before the Cleansing began—the floods and the genetic kill switch that would erase them from existence. Ninety-three cycles, and the Council had voted to let them burn.

Her boots made soft sounds against the corridor floor—a synthetic material designed to dampen vibration and mask movement during rest periods. The Anunnaki had engineered their vessels for efficiency in all things, including silence. Now that engineering served her purpose instead of theirs.

A junction approached. Inanna slowed, pressing herself against the curved wall as she consulted the mental map she'd constructed over months of careful observation. Left led to the primary engineering hub, where a skeleton crew would be running diagnostics on the atmospheric processors. Right descended toward the cargo holds and, beyond them, the reconnaissance pod bay.

Voices echoed from somewhere ahead—the guttural consonants of technical jargon exchanged between workers. Inanna held her breath, counting the syllables, parsing the conversation.

"—fluctuation in the tertiary coupling. Probably just thermal drift."

"Log it anyway. Commander Enlil reviews every anomaly personally since the incident at the mining colony."

The mention of her father's security commander sent ice through her veins. Enlil's paranoia had intensified since a primitive had somehow damaged an extraction drill before being neutralized. He saw sabotage in every shadow now, conspiracy in every malfunction.

*He's not wrong*, Inanna thought grimly. *Just looking in the wrong direction.*

She waited until the voices faded, then moved. The junction's sensor array would log her passage, but the technician's credentials she'd borrowed—from a worker currently sedated in the medical bay after an "accidental" exposure to soporific compounds—would show nothing unusual. Just another drone attending to another task.

The corridor curved downward, following the station's rotating geometry. Gravity shifted subtly beneath her feet as she descended toward the outer rings, where centrifugal force supplemented the artificial field generators. The air grew cooler here, carrying the metallic tang of hull proximity—that particular scent of vacuum kept at bay by meters of reinforced alloy.

Through a viewport, Earth swung into view.

Inanna stopped despite herself, despite the countdown running in her mind, despite everything.

The planet hung in the darkness like a jewel of impossible blue, swirled with white cloud formations that moved in patterns she had memorized from a thousand orbital observations. She could see the nightside edge where primitive fires flickered in scattered clusters—the humans, gathering against the dark as they had for millennia, never knowing that greater fires were coming.

*I'm sorry*, she thought, pressing her palm against the cold viewport. *I'm sorry we found you. I'm sorry for what we've taken. I'm sorry for what's coming.*

But sorry changed nothing. Only action could do that.

She turned from the viewport and continued her descent.

The docking bay access required three separate authentication protocols. Inanna's fingers trembled as she inserted the access cylinder into the first reader, watching the indicator lights cycle through verification sequences. Green. The cylinder contained valid codes.

Second reader. A biometric scan that should have rejected her immediately—but the scanner had been experiencing "intermittent failures" for the past five cycles, ever since she'd introduced a microscopic corruption into its calibration matrix. It flickered, stuttered, and defaulted to the backup protocol: voice confirmation.

"Technician Ashur, reporting for pod maintenance inspection."

The thin adhesive strip she wore against her throat—purchased from the black markets of the lower decks with jewels pried from her own ceremonial headdress—transformed her words into a reasonable approximation of the sedated worker's baritone. The device was temporary, a piece of contraband technology designed for covert operations among the lower castes. She had pressed it into place in the privacy of her quarters, where even Anunnaki surveillance could not penetrate royal privacy protocols.

Green.

Third reader. This one required the cylinder again, but with a secondary encryption key that changed every maintenance cycle. Inanna had spent six cycles cultivating a relationship with a lonely signals officer, listening to his complaints about his superiors, laughing at his attempts at humor, until he'd trusted her enough to complain about the "absurd" security protocols and the "ridiculous" algorithm that generated the encryption keys.

She'd memorized the algorithm. Calculated tonight's key during her evening meditation, while her attendants assumed she was communing with the ancestors.

The cylinder slid home. The indicator light pulsed amber—thinking, processing, deciding her fate.

*Please*, she thought, though she had stopped believing in the gods her people claimed to be long ago. *Please.*

Green.

The door irised open, revealing the docking bay beyond.

It was smaller than the primary hangar—a maintenance facility rather than a launch complex, holding perhaps a dozen reconnaissance pods in various states of repair. The vessels crouched in their berths like sleeping predators, their hulls gleaming dully in the emergency lighting. Most were undergoing some form of service, their access panels open to reveal the luminescent circuitry within.

But one—the third from the left, designated RP-7—sat whole and ready. Its maintenance had been completed ahead of schedule, logged as operational, and somehow overlooked when the duty roster was compiled for tonight's cycle.

Inanna had spent considerable effort ensuring that oversight.

Two technicians worked at the far end of the bay, their attention focused on a disassembled engine component that sparked and sputtered under their ministrations. They didn't look up as she entered. Why would they? She was just another worker, another cog in the great machine of Anunnaki efficiency.

She crossed the bay floor with measured steps, fighting the urge to run. The pod's access hatch was seventeen meters away. Sixteen. Fifteen.

One of the technicians laughed at something the other said—a sharp sound that made Inanna's heart stutter. But they still didn't turn. Still didn't see.

Ten meters. Five.

Her hand touched the pod's hull, and she had to bite back a sob of relief. The metal was cool beneath her palm, humming with dormant power. Inside this shell, she would either find salvation or death. There was no third option now.

The hatch recognized the access cylinder's authority and slid open with a soft hiss.

Inanna climbed inside, pulling the hatch closed behind her. The pod's interior was cramped—designed for observation rather than comfort, with a single acceleration couch surrounded by sensor displays and navigation interfaces. She settled into the couch, feeling the restraints automatically adjust to her smaller frame.

*Too small*, the system would note. *Pilot mass inconsistent with registered user.*

But by the time that anomaly was flagged, she intended to be far beyond the station's reach.

Her fingers danced across the control interface, initiating the launch sequence she had rehearsed a hundred times in her mind. Power systems: online. Navigation: plotting course for atmospheric entry. Communications: preparing the transmission she had encoded over months of sleepless nights.

The pod's engines began their warm-up cycle, a rising whine that would be audible throughout the bay.

Through the small viewport, she saw one of the technicians look up, frowning. Saw him tap his companion's shoulder. Saw them both turn toward her pod with expressions shifting from confusion to alarm.

Inanna's hand hovered over the launch control.

*Ninety-three cycles*, she reminded herself. *Ninety-three cycles, and then fire.*

She pressed the control.

The pod screamed to life around her, magnetic clamps releasing with a thunderous clang as the launch rail seized the vessel and hurled it toward the bay doors. Alarms shrieked—Loss of containment. Unauthorized launch. Security breach—but they were already behind her, already fading as the pod punched through the emergency barrier and into the void.

Earth filled her viewport, vast and blue and burning with possibility.

Behind her, she knew, the station was waking to her betrayal. Behind her, Enlil would be receiving the alert, his cold eyes narrowing with fury and calculation.

But ahead of her lay a world worth saving.

Inanna angled the pod toward the atmosphere and began her descent into fire.

**Scene 2: Inanna launches the stolen pod and flees toward Earth**

The reconnaissance pod shuddered as it cleared the station's outer hull, and Inanna felt the vast emptiness of space press against the thin shell surrounding her. For one terrifying heartbeat, she was utterly alone in the void—then the pod's thrusters ignited with a bone-deep vibration that pressed her into the pilot's cradle.

She punched in the descent trajectory she'd calculated during sleepless cycles of planning, her hands trembling only slightly. The pod's navigation system protested—*unauthorized descent vector, atmospheric entry angle exceeds safety parameters*—but she overrode each warning with codes she'd stolen from Enlil's own terminals.

The irony wasn't lost on her. The security commander's obsession with external threats had made him paranoid about sabotage from the mining colonies. He'd never imagined the danger might come from the King's own daughter.

The pod accelerated, its small fusion drive pushing her deeper into the planet's gravity well. Through the rear sensors, she watched the orbital station shrink—that massive ring of Anunnaki engineering that had been her prison for three hundred rotations. Its lights glittered like a crown of cold stars.

*Goodbye*, she thought. *Goodbye to all of it.*

As the pod screamed toward the atmosphere, Inanna activated the communication array. Warning lights cascaded across every display, painting the cramped interior in alternating shades of amber and red, but she ignored them. Her attention fixed on the transmission systems as she rerouted every available joule of power.

She initiated the broadcast.

The signal burst from the pod's array in a cascading wave, spreading across multiple frequencies simultaneously. Prime numbers first, the universal calling card of intelligence: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13...

Then the real message began.

She had encoded the warning in layers, each one building upon the last. Orbital mechanics describing the approach of catastrophic flooding. Gravitational calculations showing the planned disruption to Earth's stability. Timeline projections rendered in mathematical notation that any species capable of receiving the signal should eventually be able to decode.

*Extinction*, the numbers whispered across the electromagnetic spectrum. *Extinction is coming. Prepare. Survive.*

No human alive today would understand it—she knew that with painful certainty. The primitives lacked the technology, the mathematical framework, even the concept of signals from beyond their sky. But perhaps rebel Anunnaki monitoring Earth's frequencies would intercept it and understand her warning. Perhaps, millennia hence, humanity's descendants would develop receivers capable of detecting these ancient whispers. Perhaps the universe itself would remember what she had tried to do.

It was a message in a bottle cast into an infinite ocean. But it was all she had.

She added coordinates to the message—the locations of every Anunnaki installation on Earth's surface, every place where her people had touched this world. If anyone could find them, study them, perhaps they could learn something. Perhaps they could prepare.

*Perhaps they could fight back.*

The pod shuddered as it hit the first wisps of atmosphere, and Inanna gripped the console as friction-born fire began to wreathe the viewport. Through the hellish glow, she could see the planet's curve, the swirl of white clouds over green and brown landmasses.

"Broadcast strength at forty-seven percent," the pod's systems reported. "Atmospheric interference degrading signal coherence."

"Boost it," Inanna commanded. "Pull power from life support if you have to."

"Warning: Life support reduction will limit—"

"Do it!"

The cabin lights dimmed. The recycled air grew thin and hot. But on the display, the transmission strength climbed to sixty-two percent, then seventy-one.

The message would survive. Even if she didn't.

---

Twelve thousand kilometers above, on the command bridge of the orbital station, alarms shattered the routine calm.

"Unauthorized launch from docking bay seven!" Lieutenant Shamash's voice cut through the ambient hum of monitoring systems. His fingers flew across his console, pulling up tracking data. "Small craft, reconnaissance class. It's already cleared the station's defensive perimeter."

Commander Nergal strode across the bridge, his ceremonial armor catching the blue light of a dozen holographic displays. "Identification?"

"Transponder reads as Survey Pod Forty-Seven, assigned to atmospheric research." Shamash hesitated, his golden eyes widening as additional data scrolled across his screen. "Sir... the access codes used to release the docking clamps. They're—"

"They're mine."

Every head on the bridge turned toward the entrance. Commander Enlil stood in the doorway, his massive frame silhouetted against the corridor's amber lighting. He wore no armor—he'd clearly come straight from his private quarters—but he needed none. His presence alone was weapon enough.

He moved onto the bridge with the deliberate grace of a predator, and officers scrambled from his path. The air itself seemed to grow heavier, charged with the cold fury radiating from the King's security commander.

"My codes," he repeated, his voice soft and terrible. "Stolen from my personal terminal." He stopped before the main viewscreen, where a small blue dot marked the fleeing pod against Earth's curvature. "Show me the pilot."

Shamash's hands shook as he pulled up the docking bay's security footage. The image materialized in the air before them: a slender figure in a maintenance worker's coverall, face obscured by a hood, slipping into the pod's hatch.

"Enhance. Facial recognition."

The image sharpened. The hood fell back as the figure turned to seal the hatch behind her.

Princess Inanna's face filled the screen.

Silence crashed across the bridge like a physical force. Officers exchanged glances of pure horror. To speak now, to breathe too loudly, might draw the attention of the monster standing before them.

Enlil said nothing for a long moment. He simply stared at the princess's image—at her determined expression, at the defiant set of her jaw. When he finally spoke, his voice was barely above a whisper.

"She knows."

"My lord?" Nergal ventured.

"She knows about the Cleansing." Enlil's hands clenched at his sides, the tendons standing out like cables beneath his pale skin. "The princess has been spying. Playing her games of compassion and moral philosophy while stealing secrets that could doom us all."

He spun toward the weapons station, his robes swirling. "Lock targeting systems onto that pod. Prepare a full spread of plasma charges."

The weapons officer—a young female named Ereshkigal—went pale. "My lord, that's... that's the princess. The King's daughter. If we fire without authorization from—"

"I am your authorization." Enlil crossed the distance between them in three strides, looming over her station. "I am the voice of Nibiru in this system. I am the hand of judgment. And I am telling you to lock weapons on that pod before it reaches the atmosphere."

Ereshkigal's fingers moved to comply, but her hesitation had cost them precious seconds. On the viewscreen, the blue dot was already kissing the edge of Earth's atmospheric envelope.

"She's entering the ionosphere," Shamash reported. "Plasma weapons will lose thirty percent effectiveness once she's below the thermopause."

Enlil slammed his fist against the weapons console, and the impact left a dent in the reinforced metal. "Then we fire now. All batteries. Saturate her escape corridor."

"My lord." Nergal stepped forward, his voice carefully neutral. "If I may—the King will ask questions. A formal execution requires—"

"The King will be told that his daughter died in a tragic accident." Enlil's eyes never left the viewscreen. "A malfunction during an unauthorized atmospheric survey. A princess who ventured too close to the sun and was burned for her curiosity." His lips curled into something that wasn't quite a smile. "The King will grieve. He will rage. And then he will move forward, as duty demands."

The bridge crew exchanged another round of uneasy glances. They had all heard rumors of the tension between Enlil and the princess—of Inanna's soft heart and Enlil's iron will—but this was something else. This was regicide dressed in the language of duty.

"Weapons locked," Ereshkigal announced, her voice hollow. "Awaiting your command."

Enlil watched the blue dot descend, watched the princess's tiny vessel begin to glow with the first friction of atmospheric entry.

"Fire."

**Scene 3: Enlil's pursuit vessel locks weapons on Inanna's pod**

Inside the pod, the targeting alarm screamed through the cockpit.

Inanna didn't think. She grabbed the manual controls and wrenched the pod into a spinning dive, pushing the craft's systems beyond any reasonable limit. The g-forces slammed her sideways in her cradle, and she tasted blood as she bit her tongue.

*Seven seconds to impact.*

She could see them now—bright points of light streaking through the upper atmosphere, plasma charges designed to crack asteroid hulls and vaporize orbital debris. Enlil's fury made manifest in fire and light.

*Six seconds.*

The pod screamed as she pushed it into another evasive roll. Metal groaned. Something in the engine compartment exploded with a muffled whump.

*Five seconds.*

"Not like this," she gasped, fighting the controls. "Not before I've even—"

*Four seconds.*

She thought of the humans below. Of their short, bright lives. Of everything they might become if given the chance.

*Three seconds.*

She thought of her mother's face, and her father's disappointment, and Enlil's cold eyes watching her from across a banquet hall full of lies.

*Two seconds.*

The first plasma bolt missed by meters, close enough to superheat the air around her pod and send it tumbling. The second detonated against her port side, and the world became noise and fire and spinning darkness.

*One second.*

The third bolt struck the pod's belly.

Everything became fire.

Inanna's world reduced to fragments: the shriek of tearing metal, the roar of atmosphere rushing through breached hull plates, the impossible green of the canopy reaching up like hands to catch her—or crush her.

She threw the pod into a desperate corkscrew, pulling g-forces that pressed her into her seat like a giant's hand. The jungle spun beneath her—she was too low now, too deep in the atmosphere for orbital mechanics to save her.

She was flying on instinct and terror.

The starboard engine was gone, torn away by the plasma strike. The port engine screamed at maximum thrust, only accelerating her rotation. Metal shrieked against metal as the pod began to break apart around her.

Through the cracked viewport, she could see the jungle floor—impossibly far down, shrouded in green shadow and morning mist.

The pod slammed into the canopy.

The impact was a cacophony of snapping branches and screaming metal that seemed to last forever. Inanna was thrown against her restraints again and again as the vessel tumbled through layers of vegetation, each collision driving the breath from her lungs.

Then—stillness.

Not silence. The jungle was alive with sounds she'd never heard outside recordings. Calls and cries and the rustle of countless creatures responding to the violence that had invaded their world. But stillness from her pod. Stillness from the comm system. Stillness from the engines that had carried her across the void between worlds.

The pod had wedged itself between two massive trunks, hanging at an angle that left her suspended in her restraints. Blood dripped from her forehead onto the cracked viewport below her—red blood, iron-based, the same fundamental chemistry that flowed through human veins. One of the few biological similarities between their species, a quirk of parallel evolution that had made genetic engineering possible in the first place.

Her left arm screamed when she tried to move it—dislocated, she suspected. Her ribs ached with every breath.

But she was alive.

Above, through the torn hull, she glimpsed a dark shape crossing the circle of blue sky—one of Enlil's surveillance drones, banking away toward orbit.

He believed she was dead.

Inanna closed her eyes, letting the pain wash over her. She catalogued her injuries with the clinical detachment of shock, knowing that detachment wouldn't last.

She was alive. She was alone. She was on Earth.

And she had work to do.

But the work would have to wait. Darkness crept in at the edges of her vision, and despite her desperate attempts to stay conscious, her body surrendered to the trauma it had endured.

The last thing she heard before unconsciousness claimed her was the alien symphony of the jungle—a world that did not yet know she had come to save it.

**Scene 4: Enlil reports to King Anu via Holographic Communication**

The command bridge of the orbital station hung in the void like a predator surveying its domain. Through the panoramic viewports, Earth sprawled below—a sphere of blues and greens marred by the geometric scars of mining operations, the planet's surface bleeding resources into orbital processing stations that glittered like parasites feeding on a host.

Commander Enlil stood alone in the communications alcove, having dismissed his bridge crew with a single glacial glance. The holographic projector hummed to life before him, casting azure light across his angular features. He straightened his uniform—midnight fabric trimmed with the silver insignia of the Royal Fleet—and composed his expression into one of appropriate solemnity.

The air shimmered, and King Anu materialized before him.

Even as a projection, the sovereign of Nibiru commanded absolute attention. His form towered nearly eight feet, robed in ceremonial white that seemed to absorb the holographic light rather than reflect it. The crown of their people—a circlet of interlocking geometric patterns said to be forged from the first metal ever refined by their ancestors—rested upon a brow lined with the weight of millennia. His eyes, ancient and knowing, fixed upon Enlil with the patience of stars.

"Commander." The King's voice resonated through the chamber, carrying harmonics that lesser communication systems could never reproduce. "I received your priority transmission. Explain."

Enlil dropped to one knee, fist pressed against his chest in the gesture of absolute fealty. "My King, I bear grave tidings." He rose slowly, meeting Anu's gaze with practiced steadiness. "Princess Inanna is dead."

The words hung in the recycled air. Across the vast distance between Earth's orbit and Nibiru's throne room, the King's expression remained unreadable—a mask carved from stone and sorrow.

"Continue."

"She stole a reconnaissance pod during the third maintenance cycle, circumventing security protocols in a manner that suggests extensive premeditation." Enlil clasped his hands behind his back, the picture of military precision. "By the time we detected the unauthorized launch, she had already broken through the thermosphere. I assumed personal command of the response."

"As was your duty."

"I ordered warning shots across her trajectory. Standard containment protocol." Enlil's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. "She refused to respond to any communication. Refused to acknowledge surrender commands. Her course was erratic, deliberately evasive—she dove into atmospheric layers where our larger vessels could not follow."

The King's holographic form flickered slightly—interference from solar radiation, perhaps, or the tremor of emotion suppressed across light-years. "And so you fired upon my daughter."

It was not a question.

"A plasma barrage to disable her propulsion systems." Enlil's voice remained level, betraying nothing. "The intent was capture, not destruction. But her vessel was already compromised—hull integrity failing from the atmospheric stress. The impact..." He paused, allowing the silence to speak. "The pod entered an uncontrolled descent over the equatorial wilderness zone. Sector Seven-Three, beyond the boundary of any established operation."

"The crash site?"

"Confirmed via orbital imaging." Enlil gestured, and a secondary holographic display materialized between them—a bird's-eye view of devastation. Jungle canopy torn open like a wound, trees flattened in a radial pattern around a blackened crater. Smoke still rose from the wreckage, visible even from orbit. "The pod's fuel cells detonated upon impact. Thermal signatures indicate complete structural failure. No life signs detected within the debris field."

King Anu studied the image for a long moment. When he spoke again, his voice had dropped to something quieter—not softer, but deeper, like the rumble of tectonic plates shifting beneath a world's surface.

"My daughter was brilliant. Willful. She inherited her mother's fire and, I fear, my own stubborn certainty." A pause. "She was also, in her own misguided way, trying to do what she believed was right."

"She was a traitor to her people." The words left Enlil's mouth before he could temper them. "Forgive me, my King, but the princess intended to compromise our entire operation. The transmissions she broadcast during her descent—mathematical sequences, encoded data bursts—were clearly attempts to preserve information that could eventually reach hostile parties. Had she succeeded in establishing contact with rebel elements, in revealing our timeline..."

"I am aware of what she intended." Anu's gaze sharpened. "I am also aware that you have long harbored... concerns about my daughter's loyalty."

Enlil met the accusation without flinching. "My concerns were warranted, as events have proven. I take no satisfaction in being correct."

"No." The King's eyes searched his face across the void. "I don't suppose you do."

Silence stretched between them—the silence of old alliances, older grievances, and the complex web of obligation that bound the noble houses of Nibiru together. Enlil had served the crown for longer than most civilizations endured. He had watched Inanna grow from a curious child into a dangerous idealist. He had warned Anu, repeatedly, that her sympathies for the primitives would lead to catastrophe.

And now she was ash and memory, scattered across an alien jungle.

"The official record," Anu said finally, "will state that Princess Inanna died in a tragic accident during a routine survey mission. Equipment failure. An investigation will be conducted and will conclude that no party bears responsibility."

"And the transmissions she broadcast?"

"Intercepted and contained. The primitives lack the technological sophistication to decode Nibiran mathematical notation. Even if fragments reached their crude receivers, they would dismiss them as cosmic noise." The King's form flickered again. "The operation continues as planned. The harvest timeline remains unchanged."

Enlil bowed his head. "As you command."

"Commander." Anu's voice stopped him before he could end the transmission. "You will maintain orbital surveillance of the crash site for the next thirty rotations. Full spectrum analysis. Motion tracking. Thermal imaging."

Something cold moved behind Enlil's eyes—recognition, perhaps, or the faintest shadow of unease. "My King?"

"My daughter was brilliant," Anu repeated. "And she was, above all else, a survivor. I will not declare her death to the council until I am certain—absolutely certain—that she cannot return to contradict me."

The hologram dissolved, leaving Enlil alone with the blue glow of standby systems and the weight of royal suspicion.

He stood motionless for several heartbeats, staring at the space where his sovereign had been. Then he turned to the viewport, gazing down at the wounded planet below. Somewhere in that vast expanse of green—in a jungle so dense that even their advanced sensors could barely penetrate its canopy—lay the wreckage of a reconnaissance pod and, possibly, something more.

"Lieutenant Ninurta," he spoke into the ship's communication system. "Report to the bridge."

*"Commander?"*

"Prepare a surveillance drone squadron. Long-range reconnaissance configuration, passive sensors only." His reflection stared back at him from the viewport—cold eyes, sharp features, the face of a man who had built his career on certainty and who now found himself confronting the King's doubt. "I want continuous coverage of Sector Seven-Three. Every movement, every heat signature, every anomaly."

*"For how long, Commander?"*

Enlil's lips pressed into a thin line. In his mind, he saw Inanna as he had last observed her—piloting that fragile pod through plasma fire, refusing to surrender, choosing death over capture with a determination that bordered on madness.

Or perhaps not madness. Perhaps something else entirely.

"Until I'm satisfied," he said quietly, "that the princess is truly dead."

He terminated the communication and remained at the viewport, watching the planet turn beneath him. The jungle where she had fallen was rotating into darkness now, sliding into the shadow of Earth's night. Soon it would be invisible even to their most powerful optics—a black expanse of mystery where anything might survive.

Anything, or anyone.

Enlil did not believe in resurrection. He did not believe in miracles or providence or the sentimental notion that the universe rewarded the righteous. He believed in evidence, in confirmation, in the absolute certainty of verified destruction.

And until he had that certainty, Princess Inanna would remain what she had always been to him: a threat.

The stars wheeled overhead, indifferent to the machinations of those who walked among them. Below, in the darkness of an uncharted wilderness, something stirred amid the wreckage of fallen ambitions—something that refused, against all probability, to die.

**Scene 5: Inanna regains consciousness amid the wreckage**

Pain.

Not the abstract concept she had studied in medical databases, but a living thing with teeth and claws, gnawing through every nerve ending in her body. Inanna's eyes fluttered open to a world fragmented by smoke and dancing shadows.

She was still hanging in her restraints.

The harness bit into her shoulders and hips, the only thing preventing her from falling onto the shattered remnants of the navigation console below. Sparks cascaded from ruptured conduits, brief fireflies that died against the moisture-slicked surfaces of... of what?

*Green.*

The color invaded through the gaping wound in the pod's hull—a green so vivid, so impossibly saturated that her eyes, accustomed to the sterile whites and clinical blues of Nibiru vessels, could barely process it. Leaves. Vines. Living matter pressing against the twisted metal as if the jungle itself was trying to consume the wreckage.

Inanna coughed, and copper flooded her mouth. Blood. Her blood. She touched her face with trembling fingers and found the source—a gash along her temple, the wound raw and wet, already beginning to clot as her body's healing mechanisms engaged. The Anunnaki were not so different from humans in this regard—their blood carried oxygen on iron, clotted when exposed to air, and ran red when spilled. It was one of the biological parallels that had made engineering the human genome possible in the first place.

Her left arm screamed when she moved it, the shoulder dislocated as she had suspected.

*Move. You must move.*

The pod groaned, metal shrieking against metal as it shifted in whatever organic cradle had caught it. Through the smoke, she could see the canopy far above—impossibly far—where her vessel had torn a ragged hole in its descent. Fragments of burning debris still drifted down like dying stars.

With her functioning arm, Inanna reached for the harness release. Her fingers, slick with blood and hydraulic fluid, slipped twice before finding purchase. The mechanism clicked.

She fell.

The impact drove the air from her lungs and sent fresh agony radiating from her injured shoulder. For a long moment, she could only lie there on the crumpled hull plating, staring at the smoke curling toward that distant gap in the green ceiling, fighting the darkness that lapped at the edges of her consciousness.

*Get up. Enlil will send recovery teams. They will find the wreckage. They will find you.*

The thought cut through the pain like a blade. Inanna rolled onto her stomach, biting back a cry as her shoulder protested, and began to crawl.

The breach in the hull was barely wide enough for her body. Jagged metal caught her flight suit, tearing the fabric, scoring her skin beneath. She didn't stop. Couldn't stop. Behind her, something in the pod's power core began to whine—a rising pitch that her engineering training recognized as a containment failure.

Inanna pulled herself through the gap and tumbled onto something soft and wet and alive.

The jungle floor.

She had perhaps three seconds to register this before the pod's core breached. The explosion was muffled by the dense vegetation, but the shockwave still lifted her and threw her against the base of a tree so massive she couldn't see where its trunk ended and the canopy began. Her vision went white, then red, then mercifully dark.

---

When consciousness returned again, the fire had spread.

Inanna watched it through half-lidded eyes—the flames consuming what remained of her pod, her last connection to everything she had ever known. The heat pressed against her face like a physical force, but the moisture in the air and the sheer wetness of the surrounding vegetation kept the blaze from spreading far. The jungle, it seemed, was not so easily conquered.

She needed to move. The fire would attract attention—from Enlil's scouts if they came, and from whatever creatures called this place home.

*Creatures.*

The word triggered something in her memory. All those hours spent monitoring the planet's surface, cataloging the life forms that roamed its wilderness. Predators. Prey. An entire ecosystem operating on principles of violence and survival that her people had long since engineered out of their own existence.

She was prey now.

The realization should have terrified her. Instead, it cut through the fog of pain and shock with crystalline clarity. For the first time in her life, Inanna was not a princess, not a scientist, not a daughter or a rebel or a symbol. She was simply a living thing in a world that did not care about her titles or her bloodline or her good intentions.

She was alive. And she intended to stay that way.

Using the tree as support, Inanna pulled herself upright. Her left arm hung uselessly at her side—definitely dislocated, possibly fractured. Her ribs ached with every breath. The gash on her temple had begun to clot, the blood thickening as her body's healing mechanisms worked—slower than she would have liked, but functional. She was grateful for that small mercy.

But her legs held. Her heart beat. Her lungs filled with air so thick and rich and *alive* that each breath felt like drinking.

The sounds hit her next.

On Nibiru vessels, silence was the default state. Every noise was controlled, regulated, filtered. Here, sound was a living tapestry—clicks and calls and rustlings and the constant drip of moisture from leaf to leaf. Insects hummed in frequencies she had never heard. Something large moved through the undergrowth to her left, its passage marked by the crack of branches and the startled flight of smaller creatures.

And the smells. Decay and growth, rot and bloom, all tangled together in an olfactory assault that made her eyes water. Life feeding on death feeding on life, an endless cycle that her people had interrupted but never truly understood.

Inanna took a step away from the burning wreckage. Then another. Her feet sank into the soft earth, and she had to grab a hanging vine to keep from falling. The vine was covered in something sticky—sap, perhaps, or some secretion she couldn't identify. It clung to her palm like a living thing.

She laughed.

The sound was strange in her own ears—raw and broken and utterly human. Is this what her mother's people had felt, all those generations ago, when they first walked upright across the savannas? This terrible, exhilarating vulnerability?

The fire behind her was dying now, smothered by the jungle's wet embrace. Soon there would be nothing left of the pod but slag and ash. Nothing to mark that she had ever existed.

*Good.*

Let Enlil believe her dead. Let her father mourn. Let the Council proceed with their monstrous plans without the inconvenience of a princess who asked too many questions.

She would survive. She would find a way to warn the humans. And when the time came, she would make her people answer for what they intended to do.

But first, she had to survive the night.

Inanna turned her back on the dying flames and limped deeper into the primordial darkness. Above her, through gaps in the canopy, unfamiliar stars wheeled across an alien sky. Somewhere in the distance, something screamed—a sound of predator or prey, she couldn't tell.

It didn't matter.

She was no longer Princess Inanna of the Royal House of Anu, heir to the scientific legacy of Nibiru.

She was something new. Something this world had never seen.

She was alone.

And she was free.

The jungle swallowed her whole, and the night closed in like a fist.
