    "description": "Max Monroe was the CIA's best pattern analyst until a failed operation in Kyiv left three agents dead and his career in ruins. Now 29 and buried in a desk job at the obscure Strategic Global Intelligence Agency, he's given one chance at redemption: find Mariana Alvidrez, the assassin known as 'The Widow,' before she strikes again. Her signature is unmistakable—wealthy tech moguls found dead in luxury hotels, lips stained black from a neurotoxin-laced kiss that mimics natural heart failure.\n\nBut Max's investigation reveals a pattern his superiors missed. Every victim shares a connection to Nexus Solutions, a now-defunct 'consulting firm' that operated in Eastern Europe fifteen years ago. When Max goes undercover as a venture capitalist at a Monaco tech summit—the Widow's known hunting ground—he finally comes face-to-face with Mariana. She's not what he expected: brilliant, damaged, and hunting men from a list she's spent half her life compiling.\n\nMariana recognizes Max isn't who he claims to be, but she doesn't run. Instead, she makes him an offer: help her finish her list, and she'll give him the evidence that will expose Nexus Solutions for what it really was—a human trafficking network that sold young women to oligarchs and tech billionaires. The same network his own agency helped cover up to protect diplomatic relations.\n\nAs Max digs deeper, he realizes Mariana was one of those women. Her 'clients' aren't random targets—they're her former captors. And the Russian oligarch supposedly hiring her, Mikhail Vershinsky? He's her next target, the man who bought her when she was seventeen.\n\nCaught between the agency that betrayed him and the woman they've labeled a monster, Max must decide: complete his mission and protect a conspiracy that destroys lives, or help Mariana finish what she started and become a fugitive himself. But Vershinsky knows they're coming, SGIA has an asset embedded closer than Max realizes, and Mariana's final target will force Max to confront the real reason he was chosen for this assignment—he was in Kyiv the night Nexus Solutions burned, and someone wants to know what he remembers.\n\nIn a game where everyone has blood on their hands, the only way out is through, and the deadliest poison might be the truth.",
