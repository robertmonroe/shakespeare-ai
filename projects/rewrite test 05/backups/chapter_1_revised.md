# Chapter 1: The Cat Who Wouldn't Leave

**Scene 1: Marcus walks home from school alone, deliberately taking the long route**

Marcus adjusted his backpack straps and turned left instead of right at the corner of Maple and Fifth. The long way. Again.

His sneakers scuffed against the sidewalk as he walked, each step eating up another minute before he'd have to open the front door to that silent house. Twenty minutes if he kept this pace. Maybe twenty-five if he stopped at the convenience store and pretended to browse the magazines he'd never buy.

Six months since Dad died, and the house still felt like a mausoleum.

The October air carried the smell of someone's fireplace and dying leaves. Marcus kicked at a pile of them, watching the orange and yellow scatter across the concrete. Mrs. Chen was raking her lawn across the street, the rhythmic scrape of metal tines against grass a sound that belonged to normal life. The life he used to have.

He pulled out his phone. No texts. Riley had stopped asking him to hang out weeks ago, and Marcus couldn't even blame him. Who wanted to be around the guy whose dad was dead and whose little brother had stopped talking?

A small sound made him glance back.

About twenty feet behind him, an orange tabby sat in the middle of the sidewalk, watching him with unblinking green eyes. Its fur stuck up in tufts, and one ear had a notch missing from its tip. Definitely a stray.

Marcus kept walking.

The soft padding of paws followed.

He stopped. The cat stopped.

"Go home," Marcus said, not bothering to look back. "Shoo."

The padding resumed when he did.

Marcus spun around. "I'm serious. I don't have any food, and I'm not going to pet you or whatever you want."

The cat sat again, tail curling around its paws with perfect composure. A leaf drifted down and landed on its head. The cat didn't even twitch.

"Great," Marcus muttered. "A stalker cat."

He walked faster, cutting through the park where the playground equipment cast long shadows in the late afternoon sun. The swings swayed empty in the breeze, their chains creaking. He used to bring Jamie here, back when Jamie still laughed, still talked, still acted like a regular eight-year-old instead of a ghost haunting their house in superhero pajamas.

Marcus's chest tightened. He pushed the thought away and focused on his footsteps. One foot, then the other. Keep moving. Don't think.

A flash of orange in his peripheral vision.

The cat had somehow gotten ahead of him and now sat directly in his path, blocking the trail exit. Its whiskers twitched.

"You've got to be kidding me." Marcus stepped to the left. The cat mirrored him. He stepped right. So did the cat.

"What do you want?" Marcus's voice came out sharper than he intended. "I told you, I don't have anything for you."

The cat meowed—a rusty sound, like it didn't get much practice—and stood up. It took three deliberate steps toward Marcus, close enough now that he could see the bits of twig caught in its matted fur and a small scratch healing on its nose.

Marcus sighed and crouched down, extending his hand. Maybe if he gave it one pat, it would leave him alone. "Fine. One pet, and then you find someone else to bother, okay?"

The cat bumped its head against his palm, harder than he expected. Its fur was surprisingly soft under the tangles, warm from the sun. A rumbling purr started up, loud enough to hear over the distant traffic.

Something in Marcus's chest loosened, just a fraction.

Then he caught himself. He stood abruptly, wiping his hand on his jeans like he could wipe away the moment of weakness. "That's it. We're done."

He walked away without looking back, but he could feel those green eyes on him the whole way.

**Scene 2: Marcus arrives home to find the cat waiting on his porch**

By the time Marcus reached his street, his house loomed ahead. Same beige siding. Same dark windows. Same car in the driveway that his mom barely drove anymore. The grass needed mowing—he'd add it to his mental list of things that somehow became his responsibility: lawn care, making sure Jamie ate breakfast, signing permission slips with Mom's name when she forgot, pretending everything was fine.

Marcus climbed the three porch steps, fishing his keys from his pocket.

A meow echoed from behind him.

No. No way.

He turned.

The orange tabby sat at the bottom of the steps, looking up at him with an expression that could only be described as triumphant.

"You followed me all the way here?" Marcus's voice cracked with disbelief. "That's got to be at least half a mile!"

The cat meowed again and began washing its paw, completely unconcerned.

Marcus pointed back toward the direction they'd come. "Go. Home. I'm not letting you in."

The cat continued its bath.

"I mean it. You can't stay here."

One ear flicked in his direction, but otherwise, the cat ignored him completely.

Marcus stood there, key in hand, staring down at the most persistent animal he'd ever encountered. The cat stared back, utterly unbothered, utterly certain.

He unlocked the door and slipped inside—and immediately heard his mother's voice from the kitchen, flat and mechanical.

"Marcus? That you?"

"Yeah, Mom."

Through the screen door, he could still see the orange tabby settling down on the welcome mat, curling into a ball like it had found exactly where it wanted to be.

Marcus dropped his backpack by the door and headed for the kitchen. The house smelled like boiled chicken and nothing else—no garlic, no herbs, no warmth. His mother stood at the stove, stirring a pot with mechanical precision. She wore the same gray cardigan she'd been wearing for three days, her dark hair pulled back in a messy knot. The timer hadn't been set. She was just stirring.

At the kitchen table, Jamie sat hunched over his coloring book, a green crayon gripped in his small fist. He was coloring the sky green. He'd been coloring everything green for two weeks now. Before that, it had been all black.

"How was school?" she asked, her voice distant.

"Fine. Got an A on my chemistry test."

"That's good."

She wouldn't ask to see it. She used to ask to see everything—every test, every assignment, every doodle in the margins. Now the words just floated between them, empty of meaning.

A sharp *bark* erupted from the front porch.

Marcus nearly dropped the glass of water he'd just poured. Jamie's crayon stopped mid-stroke.

Their mother turned from the stove, her wooden spoon dripping onto the linoleum. "What was that?"

"Nothing. Just a—" Marcus started, but another bark cut him off.

His mother moved past him, her slippers shuffling across the floor. She pushed open the screen door and froze.

The orange tabby sat on the welcome mat, tail swishing back and forth across the weathered wood. When it saw her, it barked again—a sound so distinctly canine that Marcus felt his skin prickle with wrongness.

"Marcus." His mother's voice had changed. Something in it shifted, cracked open just slightly. "There's a cat on our porch."

"I know. It followed me home. I was going to—"

"It's barking."

"Yeah, I noticed that too. It's weird. I'll shoo it away—"

"No." The word came out sharp, immediate. His mother crouched down, and the cat—clearly male, Marcus could see now—immediately trotted forward, pressing his scruffy head against her palm. "Oh, aren't you sweet? Look at you."

Marcus watched something flicker across her face—surprise at her own reaction, maybe, or desperation for anything that felt like hope.

"Mom, we can't keep a stray cat. We don't know where he's been, if he has diseases—"

"He needs a home." She was scratching behind the cat's ears now, and the thing had the audacity to bark happily, like a dog getting belly rubs. "Don't you, sweetheart? Look how thin he is."

"Mom—"

"We're keeping him." She stood up, cradling the cat against her cardigan. Orange fur was getting all over the gray wool, but she didn't seem to care. "Jamie, come look. We have a cat."

Marcus turned to see his little brother standing in the kitchen doorway, his green crayon still clutched in one hand. Jamie's dark eyes—so much like Dad's—were fixed on the cat with an intensity Marcus hadn't seen in months.

The cat barked.

Jamie's mouth twitched. Not quite a smile, but something. Something that looked almost like interest.

"See?" His mother's voice was bright, brittle, desperate. "He likes it. We'll need food, and a litter box, and—Marcus, can you run to the store? There's money in my purse."

"Mom, this is crazy. That cat is *barking*. Something's wrong with him."

"So?" She looked at him then, really looked at him, and Marcus saw something fierce blazing in her eyes. Something he'd thought had died six months ago in a hospital room that smelled like antiseptic and grief. "So what if he's a little different? We're keeping him."

The cat barked again, and Jamie took three steps closer, his small hand reaching out tentatively.

Marcus felt something tight and hot lodge in his throat. This was insane. The cat was clearly defective, probably sick, definitely *wrong*. But his mother was holding him like he was precious, and Jamie was *moving*, *reaching*, almost *present* for the first time since the funeral.

"Fine," Marcus heard himself say. "What do we need?"

His mother rattled off a list—cat food, litter, a collar—while the orange tabby settled into her arms and barked contentedly at the ceiling.

Jamie's fingers brushed against the cat's tail.

And Marcus wondered what kind of broken creature shows up at exactly the right moment to a house full of broken people.

"We should name him," his mother said, already heading back inside, the cat purring—or was it growling?—against her chest. "What about Whiskers?"

Marcus grabbed his jacket and his mother's purse, trying to ignore the way his chest felt too tight, too full of something he didn't want to name.

Behind him, he heard it: the softest sound, barely a whisper.

Jamie, giggling.

**Scene 3: During an awkward dinner, Whiskers barks at the mailman and plays fetch**

The dining room felt too large for three people. Marcus sat in his usual spot, pushing chicken and rice around his plate in careful patterns. Mom occupied the chair at the head of the table—Dad's old spot—though she'd lost so much weight these past months that she seemed to disappear into it. Jamie sat across from Marcus, methodically separating his peas from his rice, one green sphere at a time.

The scrape of forks against plates was the only sound.

Marcus cut his chicken into smaller pieces, though he wasn't particularly hungry. The overhead light hummed, a persistent mosquito whine that had started last week. He should probably fix it.

"How was school?" Mom asked, her voice thin as tissue paper.

"Fine." Marcus took a bite of rice. It tasted like cardboard, but then again, everything did lately.

Mom nodded, lifting her fork halfway to her mouth before setting it down again. She'd rearranged the same piece of chicken three times now. Marcus had been counting.

"Jamie?" Mom tried. "Did you have fun in art class today?"

Jamie's fork paused mid-separation. He didn't look up.

The silence stretched like taffy, sticky and uncomfortable. Marcus cleared his throat. "Mrs. Patterson said Jamie's drawing was really good. She hung it up on the—"

A sharp bark shattered the quiet.

All three of them jumped. Marcus's fork clattered against his plate.

Whiskers stood at the dining room window, front paws on the sill, tail rigid. Through the glass, the mailman was visible on the sidewalk, stuffing letters into the Hendersons' mailbox across the street.

"Woof! Woof-woof!"

The sound was unmistakable. Loud, aggressive, territorial. Exactly like a dog protecting its home.

Except it was coming from a cat.

"Did that cat just..." Mom's fork hung suspended in midair.

Whiskers barked again, a deep chest-rumble that no feline throat should produce. His ears were flat against his head, his whole body quivering with the effort.

"Cats don't bark," Marcus said, stating the obvious because someone had to. "That's—that's not possible."

The mailman moved on to the next house. Whiskers watched him go, then dropped from the windowsill with a satisfied chirp, as if he'd successfully defended the territory. He trotted into the dining room, tail high, and sat beside Marcus's chair.

"Maybe he's part dog?" Mom offered weakly.

"That's not how biology works." Marcus stabbed a piece of chicken with more force than necessary. "He's probably just... I don't know, defective or something."

Whiskers meowed—a normal, cat-like sound this time—and bumped his head against Marcus's leg.

"We should probably take him to a vet," Mom said, though her voice lacked conviction. "Make sure he's healthy."

"Sure. Yeah." Marcus knew neither of them would actually make the appointment. That would require energy, decision-making, the kind of forward momentum their family had lost six months ago.

He crumpled his napkin and tossed it onto his plate. The paper ball bounced, rolled, and fell to the floor.

Whiskers's head snapped toward it.

In one fluid motion, the cat pounced. He grabbed the napkin in his teeth, trotted back to Marcus, and dropped it at his feet. Then he sat, looking up expectantly, his tail sweeping back and forth across the hardwood floor in wide, enthusiastic arcs.

Like a dog wagging its tail.

Marcus stared. "You have got to be kidding me."

"Did he just..." Mom leaned forward in her chair, actually engaged for the first time in weeks. "Fetch?"

Whiskers meowed and nudged the napkin closer to Marcus's shoe.

"Throw it again," Mom said.

"I'm not—"

"Marcus, throw it again."

There was something in her voice, a spark of curiosity that Marcus hadn't heard in months. He picked up the napkin, still damp from cat saliva, and tossed it toward the kitchen doorway.

Whiskers shot after it like an orange bullet. His paws skidded on the hardwood as he rounded the corner, and they heard a soft thump as he collided with something. A moment later, he reappeared, napkin clenched proudly in his jaws.

This time, he brought it to Jamie.

Marcus's little brother had stopped separating his peas. He was watching the cat, his eyes wider than Marcus had seen them in half a year. Whiskers dropped the napkin and sat, tail wagging, waiting.

Jamie's hand moved slowly toward the crumpled paper. His fingers closed around it.

Marcus held his breath. Mom had gone completely still.

Jamie picked up the napkin. His arm drew back. For a moment, Marcus thought he might speak, might say something, anything, even just the cat's name.

But Jamie only threw the napkin. It sailed past the kitchen doorway and landed somewhere near the refrigerator.

Whiskers barked once—a happy, playful sound—and bounded after it.

"Well," Mom said softly, and Marcus heard something in her voice he'd almost forgotten. It took him a moment to recognize it: the faint edge of a smile. "That's the strangest cat I've ever seen."

The cat returned, tail wagging like a metronome, and dropped the napkin at Jamie's feet again. This time, when Marcus looked at his little brother, he saw the tiniest upward curve at the corner of Jamie's mouth.

Not quite a smile. But close.

Marcus's chest tightened with something he couldn't name. Hope felt too dangerous, but there it was anyway, small and stubborn and unwelcome, taking root in the spaces between his ribs.

"He's definitely defective," Marcus muttered, but when Whiskers brought the napkin to him next, he threw it again.

**Scene 4: After dinner, Marcus retreats to his room to do homework**

Marcus climbed the stairs to his bedroom, the familiar creak of the seventh step announcing his retreat. He closed his door and leaned against it, letting out a breath he didn't know he'd been holding.

His backpack slumped against his desk like an accusation. Chemistry. Calc. AP English. The stack of textbooks seemed to have multiplied since this morning, breeding in the dark corners of his locker. He pulled out his laptop and opened it, the screen's glow washing his face in blue light.

*Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy...*

The words blurred. He blinked hard, refocused.

*...through a process that occurs in chloroplasts...*

From downstairs came the muffled sound of his mother's voice. She was on the phone—her "talking to professionals" voice, carefully modulated, each word measured and controlled. Marcus tried to ignore it, but his fingers had stopped typing.

He shouldn't listen. He had three chapters to read, a lab report to finish, college essay revisions that Ms. Patterson had returned with encouraging comments and way too much red ink.

The floorboards in the hallway amplified sound like a megaphone pointed straight at his room.

"...I understand, Dr. Morrison. Yes, I know it's been six months."

Marcus's hand hovered over his keyboard.

"Jamie's still not... No. Not a single word."

The cursor blinked on his screen. Patient. Waiting. He'd typed half a sentence about cellular respiration and couldn't remember what came next.

"What kind of timeline are we looking at?" His mother's voice had gone thin, stretched tight like wire about to snap.

Marcus stood up, moved to his door. He pressed his palm against the wood, feeling the slight vibration of her words traveling through the bones of the house.

"Residential?" The word cracked. "You mean send him away?"

His chest constricted. The air in his room suddenly felt insufficient, like someone had stolen half the oxygen.

"How soon would... I see. Another month. Six weeks at most."

Marcus sank down, his back against the door, knees pulled up. His chemistry textbook lay open on his desk, pages filled with formulas that made sense, reactions that followed predictable patterns. If only grief worked like that. If only you could balance the equation and solve for x.

"I just don't know if I can..." His mother's voice dissolved into something wordless.

The silence that followed was worse than the crying. Marcus counted the seconds—one, two, three—waiting for her to continue. Downstairs, the old grandfather clock in the hallway ticked its steady rhythm. Dad had wound it every Sunday morning, coffee in one hand, humming off-key.

No one had wound it in months, but somehow it kept ticking.

"All right," his mother said finally, voice scraped hollow. "Yes. I'll watch for the signs you mentioned. Thank you, Dr. Morrison."

The soft click of the phone being set down. Footsteps moving toward the kitchen. The running of water—she'd be washing dishes that were already clean, her hands needing something to do.

Marcus tilted his head back against the door. The ceiling of his room bore the same glow-in-the-dark stars he'd stuck up there in sixth grade. Dad had helped him arrange them in actual constellations, standing on a wobbly chair while Marcus read the positions from a library book.

*Six weeks.*

The words settled over him like a weight. Six weeks to fix what six months had broken. Six weeks before they took Jamie away to some facility where Marcus couldn't protect him, couldn't make sure he ate his breakfast or remembered his jacket or—

A soft scratching sound interrupted his spiral.

Marcus opened his eyes. Through the crack at the bottom of his door, he could see an orange paw reaching underneath, flexing and grasping at nothing.

A questioning meow came from the hallway.

Despite everything—the phone call, the deadline hanging over Jamie's head, the homework avalanche waiting to bury him—Marcus felt his mouth twitch. He stood and opened the door.

Whiskers sat in the hallway, tail starting its helicopter motion the moment he saw Marcus. Those green eyes caught the nightlight from Jamie's room, reflecting it back like tiny moons.

"You want in?" Marcus asked.

The cat trotted past him into the room, immediately jumping onto Marcus's bed and settling on the extra pillow like he owned it.

Marcus shook his head and returned to his desk, but the words on the screen still wouldn't come into focus. After a few minutes, he gave up and pulled his tennis shoe off, tossing it weakly across the room.

Whiskers's head snapped up. He bolted after the shoe, grabbed it in his teeth, and brought it back, dropping it at Marcus's feet with a proud meow.

Marcus threw it again.

And again.

And again, until his arm hurt and his vision blurred and he wasn't sure anymore if he was laughing or crying or some mangled combination of both.

Outside his window, the last light bled from the sky, and the glow-in-the-dark stars began their slow awakening overhead.

**Scene 5: Marcus goes to check on Jamie before bed and finds him sitting on his bedroom floor with Whiskers**

Two hours later, after giving up on chemistry entirely, Marcus stood outside Jamie's door at 9:47 PM, hand hovering over the knob. This was the worst part of every day—the nightly ritual that never changed. He'd knock twice, push the door open to find his little brother sitting cross-legged on the floor, staring at nothing. Sometimes Jamie would look up. Most times he wouldn't. Either way, he never spoke.

Marcus knocked.

"Hey, buddy. Time for bed."

He turned the knob and stepped inside—then froze.

Jamie sat on the carpet in his dinosaur pajamas, but he wasn't staring at nothing. His eyes were fixed on Whiskers, who crouched about three feet away, orange tail swishing back and forth across the blue rug. Not the lazy flick of a cat's tail. The enthusiastic wag of a dog waiting for a command.

"What are you—"

"Shhh." Jamie's hand shot up, palm out.

Marcus's breath caught. His brother had just shushed him. Actually responded to his presence.

Jamie's hand moved to his lap, and Marcus noticed the pile of Legos scattered around him—the set Dad had given him last Christmas, still in its box until tonight. Jamie picked up a red brick and held it up.

Whiskers's ears perked forward.

"Get it," Jamie whispered.

The cat's haunches wiggled. Then he pounced, batting the Lego across the carpet before scooping it up in his mouth and trotting back to Jamie. He dropped it at the boy's feet and sat, tail thumping against the floor.

*Thump. Thump. Thump.*

Jamie's mouth twitched. Not quite a smile, but close—closer than Marcus had seen in six months.

"Good boy," Jamie murmured, stroking the cat's head.

Whiskers leaned into the touch, then suddenly rolled onto his back, paws in the air. His tail continued its dog-like wagging, sweeping back and forth across the carpet.

And then it happened.

A sound Marcus had forgotten existed—high and light and impossibly precious. Jamie laughed. Just a small huff of air, barely more than a breath, but unmistakably a laugh.

Marcus's hand tightened on the doorknob. His chest constricted, every muscle in his body tensing with the desperate need to not move, not breathe, not do anything that might shatter this fragile moment. The hallway light cast his shadow across the threshold, but Jamie didn't seem to notice. His whole world had narrowed to the weird cat doing a perfect impression of a golden retriever.

Jamie picked up another Lego, this time a yellow one. "Sit."

Whiskers rolled upright and sat, tail still wagging.

"Lie down."

The cat flopped onto his belly, chin resting on his paws, green eyes bright and alert.

Jamie's shoulders—which had been hunched up near his ears for months, tight with unspoken grief—relaxed. He reached out with both hands and buried his fingers in Whiskers's fur. The cat started purring, a rumbling sound that filled the quiet bedroom.

"He's weird," Jamie said softly.

Marcus's throat closed up. Words. Actual words, strung together into a sentence.

"Yeah," Marcus managed, his voice rough. "He really is."

Jamie looked up then, and for the first time in forever, his eyes weren't empty. They were present. Focused. Still sad—they'd probably be sad for a long time—but alive in a way they hadn't been since the funeral.

"Can he sleep here tonight?" Jamie asked.

Marcus nodded, not trusting himself to speak again. He watched as Jamie stood, scooped up the cat—who remained completely relaxed in his arms, still purring—and carried him to the bed. Jamie climbed under the covers, and Whiskers curled up against his chest, tail wrapped around himself like a furry orange comma.

"Night, Marcus," Jamie whispered into the cat's fur.

"Night, buddy."

Marcus backed out of the room slowly, pulling the door almost closed. He left it open a crack, the way Jamie liked it, so the hallway light could seep in. Through the gap, he could see his brother's small form under the blankets, one hand resting on the cat's side, rising and falling with each breath.

In the hallway, Marcus leaned against the wall and pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes. His chest felt too full, like something that had been compressed for months was finally expanding. He didn't know if he wanted to laugh or cry or both.

The sound of his mother's footsteps on the stairs made him look up. She stopped when she saw his face.

"Marcus? What's wrong?"

He shook his head, then gestured toward Jamie's door. She moved closer, peering through the crack, and he watched her expression shift—confusion, then understanding, then something that looked like the first real hope either of them had felt in half a year.

She looked at Marcus, eyes shining. "Did he—?"

"He talked," Marcus confirmed. "And he laughed."

His mother's hand flew to her mouth. For a moment, they just stood there in the hallway, neither speaking, both afraid to believe it might mean something. That maybe, just maybe, they weren't losing Jamie after all.

From inside the bedroom came a soft sound—Jamie, humming. Not a song, exactly. Just a gentle noise, the kind of sound that meant contentment. The kind of sound they hadn't heard from him since before.

Marcus's mother reached out and squeezed his shoulder. "That cat," she said softly.

"I know," Marcus replied.

He didn't understand it. Didn't understand how a defective cat who thought he was a dog could reach his brother when nothing else could. But standing there in the dim hallway, listening to Jamie hum while Whiskers purred, Marcus decided understanding didn't matter.

What mattered was that for the first time in six months, his little brother had laughed.

**Scene 6: Late that night, Marcus lies awake**

The ceiling fan made its familiar clicking sound—once per rotation, always on the second blade. Marcus had been counting the clicks for the past hour. Two hundred and seventeen. Two hundred and eighteen.

His door was open a crack—he'd left it that way after checking on Jamie—and soft sounds drifted through from the hallway. The house settling. His mother's door closing. The distant hum of the refrigerator downstairs.

Marcus rolled onto his side, staring at the strip of light beneath his door. He should be asleep. Tomorrow was Friday, which meant a calculus quiz and a shift at the library after school. But his brain wouldn't quiet, kept replaying Jamie's laugh, the sound of his voice, the way his eyes had looked almost normal for those few minutes.

*Six weeks*, Dr. Morrison had said. Six weeks before they'd consider residential treatment.

But Jamie had talked tonight. That had to mean something. That had to count.

A shadow moved across the light strip beneath his door. Soft padding footsteps in the hallway.

Marcus sat up. "Whiskers?"

A questioning meow answered him, followed by more padding. The cat must have left Jamie's room.

Marcus got out of bed and opened his door wider. Whiskers sat in the hallway, his tail starting its helicopter motion the moment he saw Marcus. Those green eyes caught the nightlight from Jamie's room, reflecting it back like tiny moons.

"You're supposed to be with Jamie," Marcus whispered.

The cat's tail wagged harder. He stood and trotted into Marcus's room, immediately jumping onto the bed and settling on the extra pillow like he owned it.

Marcus shook his head but didn't have the energy to argue. He climbed back under the covers. Whiskers shifted closer, his warm weight a solid presence against Marcus's side.

"You're weird," Marcus said quietly.

The cat's purr rumbled in response.

"And you're probably going to be a huge pain."

The purr grew louder.

Marcus reached out, his hand finding the soft fur behind Whiskers's ears. The cat leaned into the touch, and his tail gave a contented thump against the mattress.

"One week," Marcus whispered. "We'll see how this goes for one week. But if you're going to stay, you need to keep doing whatever you did tonight. Mom needs reasons to smile. Jamie needs..." He paused, his throat tightening. "Jamie needs something to care about. Something that cares back."

Whiskers butted his head against Marcus's hand, then licked his wrist with a sandpaper tongue.

Marcus found himself almost smiling—a strange, unfamiliar expression that felt rusty on his face. He pulled his hand back and settled deeper into his pillow.

The ceiling fan kept clicking. The refrigerator kept humming. But now there was also the sound of purring, deep and steady and alive.

His father used to say that sometimes the universe sent you exactly what you needed, even if it looked nothing like what you wanted. Marcus had always thought that was the kind of thing adults said to make disappointment sound philosophical. But Dad had believed it. Really believed it.

Marcus closed his eyes. For the first time in months, the darkness didn't feel quite so heavy. It still pressed down on him—grief didn't disappear just because a strange cat showed up—but there was something else now too. Something small and warm and persistently, illogically hopeful.

Whiskers's purr grew louder, and his tail gave one final thump against the pillow.

"Goodnight, Whiskers," Marcus murmured.

The cat's response was to curl tighter against his side, a warm weight that somehow made breathing a little easier.

Tomorrow, Marcus would wake up and make breakfast. He'd check Jamie's backpack and remind Mom about her medication and pretend that everything was fine. But tonight, for the first time in six months, he fell asleep to the sound of purring instead of silence.

And in the morning, when he woke, the cat who barked would still be there.
