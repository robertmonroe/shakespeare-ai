## Chapter 3: The Decree of Extinction

**Scene 1: The Decree of Extinction**

The Hall of Eternal Stars stretched before Inanna, its vaulted ceiling lost in manufactured darkness studded with holographic constellations. Ten thousand years of Anunnaki dominion glittered in those false stars—each point of light representing a world conquered, a species subjugated, a civilization reduced to ore and energy.

She stood among the nobility on the observation tier, her ceremonial robes of woven gold-light feeling heavier than battle armor. The air tasted of ozone and ancient incense, that particular blend of myrrh and synthesized nebula-dust that burned only in the presence of the King. Around her, the great houses of Nibiru had assembled in their finery—the Igigi warrior clans in their crimson mantles, the Nephilim administrators draped in silver circuitry, the lesser bloodlines crowding the galleries above like carrion birds awaiting a feast.

Below, on the obsidian floor polished to mirror-brightness, the throne of Anu rose like a frozen explosion of gold and crystal. Her father sat upon it, ancient and terrible, his face a mask of serene authority that Inanna had learned to read since childhood. Today, that mask showed satisfaction.

*He's already decided,* she realized, her stomach clenching. *This ceremony is merely theater.*

Through the chamber's transparent floor, Earth turned in slow majesty. The blue-green sphere caught the light of its yellow sun, clouds swirling in patterns that Inanna had memorized over centuries of observation. She could see the fertile crescent of Mesopotamia from here, that cradle of human civilization where she had walked among them, learned their names, tasted their wine.

"The question before us," Anu's voice rolled through the hall, amplified by acoustic architecture perfected across millennia, "is not whether the human experiment has failed. That much is beyond dispute."

A murmur of agreement rippled through the assembled nobles. Inanna kept her face carefully neutral, though her fingers curled against her palms hard enough to leave crescents in her flesh.

"The question," her father continued, rising from his throne with the fluid grace that belied his age, "is how we address this failure. How we correct the contamination before it spreads beyond acceptable parameters."

On the massive display screens flanking the throne, images materialized—Earth, that blue-green jewel spinning in the darkness. The view zoomed closer, showing human settlements spreading across the fertile crescents, the river valleys, the coastal plains. Villages of mud brick and carved stone. Fields golden with grain. Children playing in dusty paths.

Inanna had walked those paths. She had eaten bread baked in those clay ovens, had listened to human poets compose verses to her beauty, had watched mothers sing their infants to sleep under stars their eyes could barely perceive. She had been worshipped as a goddess, yes—but she had also been *seen* by them in ways her own kind never bothered to look.

"The Council of Twelve has reviewed the strategic assessment," Anu announced, reclaiming the hall's attention. "Genetic drift has exceeded acceptable parameters. Humanity's capacity for abstract thought, for innovation, for ambition, has exceeded all models. Therefore, by the authority vested in this throne by the First Compact of Nibiru, I hereby decree: the human experiment is terminated."

He gestured, and holographic displays illuminated the hall, showcasing the parameters of Project Deluge. "Security Commander Enlil will outline the procedure."

Enlil strode forward, his boots striking the dais. "Project Deluge represents the culmination of three centuries of contingency planning. Phase One: The Genetic Cascade. The activation signal will be broadcast from our orbital relay network, globally within six hours. Sixty-three percent of the population carries the active kill switch gene. Initial mortality is projected at sixty-three percent, accounting for logistical limitations and genetic drift."

The image animated, showing the signal propagating across Earth's surface like a wave of invisible death. A collective shudder rippled through the assembled Anunnaki.

Enlil continued, "Phase Two: The Deluge itself. The orbital platforms we positioned during the initial terraforming remain functional. By redirecting their output to the polar ice sheets, we trigger a cascading melt event." The polar regions glowed, then cracked, then collapsed into the surrounding oceans. Massive waves radiated outward from both poles. "Sea levels rise by approximately one hundred meters within the first **one quarter-cycle**." *Note: One quarter cycle is roughly equivalent to seventy five earth years, which is the time required for Nibiru to complete one orbit. However, the initial effects will be noticed far sooner.*

*To grasp the enormity of Inanna's decision, it's crucial to understand the severe compression of time she now faces. The Anunnaki might perceive this as a methodical, almost leisurely process occurring over decades. However, for the humans on Earth, the initial effects of the deluge will be immediate and devastating. Inanna's compassion, therefore, compels her to act with unprecedented speed; even if others within the Hall view the 'cleansing' as a drawn-out affair, she knows the reality on the ground demands immediate action.*
*While the Anunnaki, with their extended lifespans, might view 'one quarter-cycle' (approximately 75 Earth years) as a relatively short period, the initial effects of the Deluge will be catastrophic and immediate for humanity. Coastal settlements will be obliterated within days or weeks of the ice melt commencing. The resulting chaos – famine, disease, and societal collapse – will decimate the survivors long before the full 75 years have elapsed. This is not a slow-motion apocalypse; it's a rapidly unfolding disaster from a human perspective.*

The holographic Earth transformed before their eyes. Continents shrank as the waters rose. The fertile crescent where humanity had built its greatest settlements vanished beneath a spreading blue stain.

"Any humans who survive the genetic cascade will find themselves in a world without shelter, without food, without hope. Combined mortality: over ninety-five percent. The survivors face starvation, exposure, and the predatory species we've already begun seeding in the mountain regions." Enlil's voice rose with barely concealed triumph. "Total extinction achieved within one quarter-cycle, with minimal resource expenditure and no risk to Anunnaki personnel."

Silence fell over the hall. Inanna counted her heartbeats—waiting for someone, *anyone*, to object.

"All specimens are to be eliminated," Anu stated. "The cleansing will commence at the next orbital alignment—seventy-two hours hence."

He raised his scepter, that ancient rod of office that had commanded the fates of a hundred worlds, and brought it down against the throne's arm with a sound like thunder.

"So it is spoken. So it shall be done."

The hall erupted in applause. Nobles raised their voices in praise of the King's wisdom, his decisive leadership, his protection of the empire's interests.

Inanna forced her hands to move, to mime the motions of celebration. Her face ached from the effort of maintaining her smile. Around her, the cream of Anunnaki civilization cheered the extinction of **15 million** souls as casually as they might celebrate a successful pest extermination.

As the celebration spilled into the adjoining reception chamber, where crystal formations harvested from Nibiru's deepest caverns lined the walls, Inanna navigated with practiced grace. Servants bore trays of fermented nectar, its amber liquid glowing faintly with enzymes palatable only to Anunnaki. Holographic entertainment projected above the central fountain displayed Earth, its blue surface marked with red zones indicating doomed population centers.

"Remarkable density in the river valleys," Lord Shamash remarked to admirers, gesturing at the projection. "The creatures congregated there like insects around sweetwater, making the cleanup more efficient."

Inanna kept walking, the golden thread of her ceremonial robes reminding her of cave paintings: *I was here. I existed.* Soon, nothing would remain.

"Princess!" A young noble approached. "Magnificent news! My father plans an expedition to observe the geological formations after the flooding."

"How forward-thinking."

"Indeed! I'll miss the entertainment value of monitoring feeds. Did you know some developed music? Primitive percussion and vocal arrangements. Charming, in a simple-minded way."

Inanna's nails dug into her palms. "Charming."

She resumed her circuit. Near the fountain, an administrator stared into his drink with discomfort. By the windows, a priestess moved her lips in prayer. An elderly scholar watched the holographic Earth with something other than celebration in his ancient eyes.

Three. Perhaps four, if she counted the servant who flinched at "extinction."

Out of hundreds.

"Inanna."

The voice came from her left, barely above a whisper. Queen Antu stood in the shadow of a crystal formation, her silver robes blending with the blue-green light.

"Mother."

Antu's face was composed, but her eyes held something Inanna couldn't name. Something older. Something tired.

"You should be mingling," Antu said finally. "Your absence will be noted."

"Let it be noted."

"Inanna." The single word carried a weight of warning.

"How can you stand here?" Inanna kept her voice low. "We're discussing the murder of **15 million** thinking, feeling beings. Beings the Chief Architect *created*."

"Like the culling of an invasive species," Antu's tone was flat. "Like a controlled burn. Like administrative necessities across a thousand worlds."

"Is that what you believe?"

The question hung between them. Antu's expression flickered.

"What I believe is irrelevant. What matters is what is."

"That's not an answer."

"No," Antu agreed softly. "It isn't."

She glanced around the chamber before leaning closer. "There are things," she breathed, "that a queen cannot say. Cannot even think, not in any way that leaves evidence. But a mother..." She pressed something small and cool into Inanna's hand, closing her daughter's fingers around it. "*The jungle remembers.*" She then revealed the coordinates encoded within.

Then she stepped back, her public mask sliding into place. "Do try the nectar, dear. The vintage is exceptional. And do congratulate Lord Shamash on his contribution to the environmental projections. He's quite proud of his calculations."

Then she was gone.

A priority one override from King Anu blared from her personal comm unit moments after her mother's departure. Her presence was demanded in his private chambers immediately.

Inanna's breath hitched. Anu's summons, so soon after her mother's cryptic warning, felt like a closing trap. Fear pierced her anger. But beneath it, a defiant ember glowed. *He suspects.* She glanced down at her closed fist. *Time to act.*

Inside her private quarters aboard Nibiru Orbital Station, Inanna reviewed her options.

*She knows. She's always known.*

Queen Antu, who smiled through state functions and played the role of dutiful consort with flawless precision. Who had given her daughter a knife on her naming day and spoken of remembering. Who had, perhaps, been running her own quiet rebellion for longer than Inanna had been alive.

Before facing her father, Inanna knew she needed to prepare for departure. Speed and stealth were now her only allies. She activated the sonic locks on her chambers, sealing the room and scrambling external sensors. Then, with swift, decisive movements, she shed the heavy ceremonial gown that marked her as royalty. The woven gold-light fabric shimmered as it fell to the floor, a symbol of the life she was leaving behind.

From a hidden compartment beneath her sleeping platform, Inanna retrieved a tightly sealed container. Inside lay a technician's jumpsuit—stolen months ago, during a surreptitious visit to the engineering decks. The dull gray fabric offered no elegance, no status, only anonymity. The suit was slightly too large, and the unfamiliar cut felt rough against her skin. But it was practical, functional, and utterly unremarkable—perfect for moving unnoticed through the station's lower levels. The container also held a pair of sturdy boots, a neural interface dampener to block intrusive telepathic scans, and a basic toolkit containing a plasma cutter, a data-tap, and a few universal access keys. These items, scavenged and smuggled over weeks, represented her first act of defiance.

Working quickly, Inanna donned the jumpsuit and boots, adjusting the fit as best she could. She secured the toolkit to her belt, ensuring the plasma cutter was within easy reach. Then, activating the neural dampener, she suppressed her Anunnaki bio-signature, masking her presence from station security systems. A quick glance in the mirror confirmed her transformation. The regal princess had vanished, replaced by a nondescript technician—a shadow among shadows, ready to disappear into the station's underbelly.

Retrieving the data-crystal Antu had passed her, Inanna interfaced it with her wrist-mounted comm unit. The coordinates shimmered into view, pinpointing a location deep within the primordial jungles of Earth—a place marked only by a series of ancient standing stones and a unique convergence of ley lines. The jungle. A place of untamed chaos, where Anunnaki technology faltered and the whispers of the planet could still be heard.

It was a long shot, a desperate gamble based on her mother's cryptic message and a glimmer of hope. But Inanna knew she had no other choice. The decree of extinction had been spoken. The countdown had begun. And she, Inanna, daughter of Anu, was about to become a fugitive.

*In the scant *seventy-two hours* remaining before the orbital alignment, Inanna must mobilize allies, secure resources, and somehow disrupt the annihilation protocols. The Anunnaki, accustomed to eons of glacial planning, are moving with what they consider reasonable speed. But to Inanna—and to the humans facing imminent obliteration—every second is precious. The fourteen days that once seemed available for careful deliberation have evaporated, replaced by a frantic race against time.*

**Realizing the immediate threat, Inanna knows she cannot afford to spend days meticulously planning her departure. The change from a three-day deadline to an immediate need to escape underscores the urgency of the situation. The summons from Anu, coupled with her mother's warning, forces her hand. Every moment spent on Nibiru Orbital Station increases her risk of detection. She must leverage her knowledge of the station, her skills, and any potential allies to initiate her plan now, compressing what might have been a more gradual escape into a desperate sprint.**

Moments later, Inanna moved swiftly through the corridors, a fierce determination hardening her features. The jungle was the destination, but survival was not the objective. Not anymore. She would find allies, uncover secrets, and strike back against the Anunnaki before they could extinguish humanity.

*First, the jungle. Then, vengeance.*

**Scene 4: Flight from the Sky**

The transport bay hummed with barely suppressed power, the air thick with the smell of ionized particles and refined lubricants. Technicians swarmed around docked vessels, performing last-minute checks and calibrations, their movements precise and efficient.

As Inanna approached, she noticed a Lanky Igigi technician, Zael, who was always tinkering with ship modifications beyond his station; he looked startled when their eyes met, but quickly bowed. Inanna remembered Zael's quiet unease during the extinction vote projection. Deciding to gamble, she approached him directly.

"Technician," Inanna stated, her voice carrying a regal tone. "I require a scout vessel prepped for immediate departure. Minimal sensor profile, maximum speed."

Zael's eyes widened slightly, fear and hope mixing within them. "Princess Inanna? I... that is highly irregular. Such requests go through channels…"

"Channels are for those who follow," Inanna interrupted, her voice softening slightly, noting Zael's discomfort. "I need someone who understands priorities. Someone who can make things… happen. Discretely." She subtly gestured towards the holographic displays showcasing Enlil's extermination plan.

Zael visibly swallowed hard. "There is a newly modified scout, Princess. Experimental engine tweaks, dampeners... virtually untraceable. But it's not officially cleared for royal transport."

"Then consider it a field test," Inanna said, a faint smile gracing her lips. "Your expertise will be... invaluable. Should it perform well." She paused, letting the unspoken incentive hang in the air.

Zael nodded quickly, his earlier fear replaced by a focused intensity. "Understood, Princess. Launch bay seven. I'll reroute the pre-flight checks. It will appear routine, just a system diagnostic."

"See to it," Inanna stated, offering a subtle nod of approval. "And technician?"

"Princess?"

"Discretion is… paramount."

Zael met her gaze, a silent understanding passing between them. He then turned and moved with purpose, weaving seamlessly amidst the other technicians, whispering directives, and manipulating console commands. Within moments, launch bay seven began to display signs of activity, a single scout vessel powering up, its engines emitting a low, resonating hum.

Inanna strode towards the scout ship, her heart pounding in her chest, but now with a spark of hope. She had found an unlikely ally in the most unexpected place. She reached the boarding ramp and turned to face Zael one last time, his features now shrouded in the dim light.

"Thank you, Zael," she whispered.

Zael simply nodded, his eyes reflecting a silent commitment.

The system pinged acknowledgment. Bay doors hissed open, revealing a sleek, silver craft, its engines glowing with barely contained energy. Other technicians scrambled to clear the launch path, their faces a mixture of surprise and deference, oblivious to the silent act of rebellion occurring before them. Inanna turned and ascended the ramp, disappearing into the belly of the ship.
