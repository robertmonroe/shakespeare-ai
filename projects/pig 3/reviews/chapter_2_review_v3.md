## Chapter 2 Review: "Arnie's Urban Adventure"

1. **Internal Consistency**
    *   In Scene 2, Arnie is described as having "scales, a dazzling emerald green," and his tail is mentioned as "massive." This conflicts with the earlier description of Arnie as a pig. A pig would typically have skin and a tail more akin to a curly pig tail, not scales and a massive tail.

2. **Clarity**
    *   In Scene 2, the line "He was getting too big for this" referring to the leash is unclear. Does Johnny mean that the leash is too short, or that Arnie is becoming too strong for the leash?
    *   In Scene 3, It is unclear how Arnie's imagined tea ended up getting him wet.

3. **Plot Holes**
    *   In Scene 1, Johnny states the backyard is a secret area that "nobody ever comes back here," yet Mrs. Rodriguez, the landlady, suddenly appears at the end of the scene. This is inconsistent with the established world, as there needs to be an explanation of how she knew to come here.
    *   In Scene 5, It is not clear how Arnie can purr.

4. **Redundancy**
    *   In Scene 2, Johnny whispers the rules to Arnie: "Stay low, stay quiet, and absolutely no… incidents." Later in the scene, after Arnie digs up the flowers, Johnny repeats similar instructions: "Don't purr, you overgrown lizard!" This is somewhat repetitive.
    *   In Scene 6, Johnny keeps repeating the fact that Arnie is growing too fast. This is reinforced several times, which makes the concept redundant.

5. **Flow and Transitions**
    *   No issues found.

6. **Actionable Fixes**

    1.  **Internal Consistency (Scene 2):** Revise the description of Arnie in Scene 2 to remove scales and adjust tail descriptions to be more pig-like. Example: "His skin, surprisingly smooth and vibrant, rippled with muscle. Hiding him under Johnny’s oversized hoodie was becoming a serious challenge."
    2.  **Clarity (Scene 2):** Clarify the meaning of "He was getting too big for this" in Scene 2. Example: "He was getting too strong for this flimsy jump rope."
    3.  **Clarity (Scene 3):** Explain how Arnie got wet in the scene.
    4.  **Plot Hole (Scene 1):** Provide a reason for Mrs. Rodriguez to appear at the secret backyard in Scene 1. Possible additions: She was doing a general check up on the property because of a water leak, or she heard unusual noises.
    5.  **Plot Hole (Scene 5):** Revise Scene 5, where Arnie purrs, to align with his pig-like characteristics. Purring is generally a feline trait.
    6.  **Redundancy (Scene 2):** Revise Scene 2 to remove the line, "Don't purr, you overgrown lizard!" because it is not as impactful and somewhat repetitive.
    7.  **Redundancy (Scene 6):** Revise Scene 6 to mention Arnie's growth issue only once or twice. Reduce the pacing to make the problem known, but not overwhelming.
