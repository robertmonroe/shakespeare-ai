## Chapter 4: Flight and Fire

**Scene 1: Inanna's Escape**

The maintenance cycle hummed, seventeen minutes underway. Inanna, disguised in a technician's jumpsuit, moved with purpose through the station's amber-lit corridors. The weight of the access cylinder, containing her father's royal clearance codes, pressed against her thigh.

*Treason*, Enlil's voice echoed in her mind. She silenced it with the memory of Earth's projected timeline, the *resonance cascade* dooming the primitives. Ninety-three cycles remained before the Cleansing. The Council had condemned them. Enlil, her brother, would approve of their extermination without hesitation.

She reached a junction. Voices ahead spoke of a fluctuation, of Enlil's increased paranoia since the mining colony sabotage. She waited, then moved toward the cargo holds. The junction's sensor array would log her passage, but the borrowed technician's credentials would mask her identity.

Descending, gravity shifted. Through a viewport, Earth swung into view, a vibrant sphere swathed in clouds. A haven teeming with life, a world under sentence.

*I'm sorry*, she thought. *I'm sorry we found you. I'm sorry for what's coming.*

She continued on.

The docking bay access demanded three authentication protocols. The access cylinder. A biometric scan, bypassed by a microscopic corruption and a purchased voice modulator mimicking the technician Ashur. The use of a voice modulator carried risks. Anunnaki vocal cords possessed unique resonant frequencies detectable by sophisticated analysis. However, Ashur was known for his heavy spice use, resulting in frequent, albeit minor, vocal inconsistencies. These natural fluctuations provided enough 'noise' to mask Inanna's own vocal signature during the brief authentication window. Finally, the cylinder again, requiring a secondary encryption key she'd calculated from a signals officer's complaints and a memorized algorithm.

*Please*, she thought, as the indicator light pulsed amber.

Green.

The door irised open, revealing the reconnaissance pod bay.

Pods crouched in their berths. RP-7 sat whole and ready, its maintenance completed ahead of schedule, its readiness overlooked. An oversight Inanna had engineered.

Two technicians worked at the far end of the bay, oblivious. She crossed the floor, her heart pounding. The pod's access hatch: seventeen meters, sixteen, fifteen…

One of the technicians laughed, making her heart stutter. But they didn't turn.

Ten meters. Five.

Her hand touched the pod's hull. Relief flooded her. Inside this shell, salvation or death awaited.

The hatch opened with a soft hiss.

Inanna climbed inside. The interior was cramped, dominated by the acceleration couch and sensor displays. The restraints adjusted automatically.

*Too small*, the system would note. But too late.

Her fingers danced across the control interface, initiating launch. Power systems: online. Navigation: plotting atmospheric entry. Communications: preparing the encoded transmission—a warning meant for the free human tribes who might track the stars, who listened to the whispers of the Earth. Not a direct message, which would be instantly intercepted and garbled. Instead, she initiated a powerful, repeating signal—a burst of prime numbers, the universal language of mathematics. It was a key, a marker. The signal included precise astronomical data—the cyclical alignment of Nibiru and certain constellations visible from Earth. A map in time, leading to a hidden frequency, a carrier wave on which a distilled warning, a desperate plea, and a fragment of hope would endlessly repeat: *The sky gods lie. Seek the jungles. Heed the ape-man.* The tribes who tracked the stars, who listened to the whispers of the Earth, might, generations from now, decipher its meaning.

The engines began their warm-up cycle.

Through the viewport, one of the technicians looked up, frowning. He tapped his companion. Both turned toward her pod, expressions shifting from confusion to alarm.

Inanna's hand hovered over the launch control.

*Ninety-three cycles*, she reminded herself. *Ninety-three cycles, and then fire.*

She pressed the control.

The pod screamed to life, magnetic clamps releasing as the launch rail seized the vessel. Alarms shrieked—Loss of containment. Unauthorized launch. Security breach—already behind her, already fading as the pod punched through the emergency barrier and into the void.

Earth filled her viewport, vast and blue.

Behind her, she knew, the station was waking to her betrayal.

Inanna angled the pod toward the atmosphere and began her descent. The heat was intense, even through the ablative shielding. G-forces stole her breath and blurred her vision, pressing her deeper into the acceleration couch. Alarms wailed – hull temperature critical, trajectory unstable, multiple system failures. She monitored sensor readings, making minute adjustments to the damaged flight controls as the onboard systems struggled to maintain control. The pod bucked violently, shuddering under the immense pressure. Molten metal streamed across the viewport as the ablative shielding fought a losing battle against the friction.

Suddenly, a deafening explosion ripped through the vessel. Warning lights cascaded across the control panel. Critical systems failure. The pod spun wildly out of control, spiraling downwards in a fiery, uncontrolled descent towards the primordial jungle below. Jagged pieces of the outer hull tore away, exposing the inner mechanisms to the searing heat. The emergency auto-stabilization system sputtered and died, leaving Inanna at the mercy of the chaotic forces tearing the pod apart. She fought to stay conscious, her vision tunneling as the G-forces reached unbearable levels, but she focused on the readouts, desperately trying to regain some semblance of control. The air crackled with ozone and the acrid smell of burning circuits. She knew the impact was imminent.

Bracing herself against the inevitable, Inanna focused on her training, attempting to override the pain and panic. The pod, now a mangled wreck of twisted metal and burning plasma, slammed through the dense jungle canopy, tearing a path of destruction through the ancient trees. A cacophony of snapping branches, exploding fuel cells, and screeching metal filled the air. The force was immense, shaking her to her core, but she clenched her jaw, refusing to yield. Her body screamed in protest as the pod finally crashed to a halt, the impact throwing her violently against the restraints. Though disoriented and in searing pain, she remained conscious, aware of the cacophony of alarms still blaring, the smell of smoke, and the taste in her mouth. She was alive. The official report would later state: Pod sustained catastrophic structural damage. No life signs detected – though a significant margin of error remained in this initial assessment, given the extreme intensity of the impact and the signal scattering caused by the dense jungle canopy.

**Scene 2: Crash Confirmation**

The official report would later state: Pod sustained catastrophic structural damage. No life signs detected – though a significant margin of error remained in this initial assessment, given the extreme intensity of the impact and the signal scattering caused by the dense jungle canopy.

The jungle held its breath.

A creature of fur and muscle moved through the shadowed undergrowth. Tarzan, the apes called him, though his true name was Enkidu. His skin was pale, an anomaly among his adopted kin. He moved with a silent grace that belied his strength, a blend of human agility and ape power.

He scented the air, a strange burning tang that stung his nostrils. Not fire. Something else. Something… wrong.

He followed the scent, his senses on high alert. The jungle was his home, and he knew its moods as well as he knew his own heart. This intrusion felt like a violation.

The trees thinned. A break in the canopy.

Then he saw it.

Metal, twisted and smoking, embedded in the earth. The air shimmered with heat. The stench of burnt chemicals was overpowering.

He approached cautiously, his ape senses warning of danger. Whatever this was, it was not natural. Not of the jungle.

He circled the wreckage, his eyes scanning for movement. Nothing. Only the hiss of escaping steam and the groan of cooling metal.

He reached out a tentative hand, touching the smooth, alien surface. It was hot. Painfully so.

Then he saw the symbol, etched into the metal near a shattered viewport. A spiral, a circle bisected by a line. He didn't understand its meaning, but he felt its power. A dark, cold power.

Cautiously, he peered inside the wreckage. The interior was a jumble of wires, broken displays, and torn metal.

And then he saw her.

Slumped in the acceleration couch, her body motionless. Her skin was pale like his own, but her hair was the color of the setting sun. She was dressed in strange clothing, a tight-fitting suit that clung to her form.

He reached out, his heart pounding in his chest. Was she alive?

He touched her face, gently. Her skin was warm.

A tremor ran through her body. Her eyelids fluttered.

She was alive.

**Scene 3: The Rescue**

Enkidu carefully pulled away the twisted metal that pinned Inanna into the acceleration couch, wincing at the grinding sound. The scent of her was strange, unfamiliar, but not unpleasant. It reminded him of starlight and ozone.

He lifted her gently from the wreckage, cradling her in his arms. She was light, fragile. Like a newborn ape.

He turned and began to carry her away from the wreckage, back into the safety of the jungle. He knew instinctively that this place was not safe. That whatever had brought this strange creature to his world would return.

He had to protect her.

Deeper into the jungle he went, his pace quickening, until he reached the hidden grove where his ape family made their home. They watched him approach, their eyes filled with curiosity and concern.

He laid Inanna gently on a bed of leaves, then turned to his family, communicating with a series of gestures and calls. *Help her*, he signed. *She is hurt*.

The apes, understanding, moved closer, sniffing her, examining her injuries. The matriarch, a wise old ape with a scarred face, touched Inanna’s forehead, then looked at Enkidu, concern etched in her eyes.

*She is not of our kind*, she signed. *But she is in need*.

Enkidu nodded. *She is under my protection*.

The matriarch grunted in agreement. The apes would care for her. As they would care for any member of their family.

**Scene 4: Awakening**

Inanna opened her eyes.

Pain lanced through her body. Every nerve ending screamed in protest.

She was lying on something soft, something that smelled of leaves and earth. Above her, the jungle canopy formed a tapestry of green, filtering the sunlight into dappled patterns.

Where was she?

The pod… the crash…

She tried to sit up, but a wave of dizziness washed over her, forcing her back down.

A shadow fell across her face.

She looked up.

A creature stood before her. Tall, muscular, with skin the color of pale earth and eyes that burned with fierce intelligence. He was covered in fur, like an ape, but his features were human.

He reached out a hand, offering her water in a cupped leaf.

She stared at him, unable to speak.

He tilted the leaf towards her lips, encouraging her to drink.

Hesitantly, she sipped the water. It was cool, refreshing.

She swallowed, then looked at him again, her mind reeling.

Who was this creature? And where was she?

“Where… am I?” she managed to croak, her voice hoarse.

The creature tilted his head, as if trying to understand. Then, he pointed to himself and grunted.

Tarzan, the apes called him.

**Scene 5: Enlil's Report**

(Moved to after Scene 6)

**Scene 6: The Healing**

Days blurred into weeks. Inanna slowly recovered, aided by the apes' rudimentary medical knowledge. They poulticed her wounds with herbs, fed her fruits and roots, and kept her warm at night.

Enkidu never left her side. He brought her food, protected her from danger, and watched over her as she slept. He didn't speak, but his eyes conveyed a depth of emotion that transcended language.

Inanna, in turn, began to learn his ways. She observed his interactions with the apes, mimicking their gestures and calls. She learned to identify edible plants, to track animals, and to move silently through the jungle.

Slowly, painstakingly, they began to communicate. He taught her the language of the apes, a complex system of gestures, vocalizations, and facial expressions. She, in turn, taught him fragments of Emegir, the Anunnaki tongue.

They were from different worlds, different species, yet they found common ground in their shared isolation, in their mutual need for companionship. A bond began to form between them, a bond of trust, of respect, of something deeper…

**Scene 5: Enlil's Report**

Twelve thousand kilometers above, on the command bridge of the *Throne of Heaven*, alarms shattered the routine calm.

On a raised dais, Enlil knelt before a shimmering holographic projection of King Anu.

“You report the loss of a survey pod, Enlil." Anu’s voice resonated.

Enlil lowered his head. “Regrettably, my King. Princess Inanna commandeered the vessel without authorization."

“Treason.” Anu steveled his fingers. “Do you have proof of this ‘treason,’ beyond the unauthorized departure?”

“The Princess had acquired data pertaining to the Cleansing protocol, my King. Sensitive information that could incite rebellion among the primitives.”

Anu was silent.

Enlil’s jaw tightened.
The mention of the mining colony sabotage still stung.

Anu sighed. “Inanna always had a… troublesome compassion. A weakness for the creatures we engineered for servitude.”

“A dangerous weakness, my King. One that could jeopardize the entire mission.”

“Perhaps.” Anu’s gaze flickered. “Or perhaps… she saw something we have forgotten.” He paused. “Regardless, the matter is closed. The Cleansing will proceed as scheduled. See to it that no further… ‘malfunctions’ occur.”

“It will be done, my King.” Enlil rose, relief washing over him. He had silenced Inanna. For now.

The holographic projection flickered and vanished, leaving Enlil alone, the weight of his actions settling heavily upon his shoulders. He knew, with a chilling certainty, that her rebellion was far from over.
