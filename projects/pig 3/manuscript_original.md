## Chapter 1: The Pig in the City

**Scene 1: Johnny sits in his small apart...**

Johnny sat in his small apartment late one afternoon, home from school. The window, smudged with old fingerprints, offered a distorted view of the city’s frenetic energy. Taxis blared, buses groaned, and a distant siren wailed. He rested his forehead against the glass, seeking a moment of cool stillness.

He released a sigh, swallowed by the city's clamor. "Old MacDonald's Farm," his cherished picture book, lay open in his lap. The farmer on the cover beamed beside a well-fed cow. Johnny traced the cow, the worn paper soft against his fingertip.

Inside, he'd marked his favorite scenes: fields of wheat, sheep dotting hillsides, a mother pig and her piglets. He paused at the pig picture, a familiar ache resonating within him. The piglets seemed so… connected, a poignant reminder of his own solitary existence.

He turned the page, the paper thin and brittle. A rooster, comb bright red, strutted across a barnyard. “Cocker-doodle-doo,” he murmured, imagining the sound echoing across open land, a world away from the city's rumble.

Closing the book, he held it close. The cramped apartment felt confining. He glanced out the window. A newspaper tumbled down the sidewalk, caught in the wind, a discarded thing. With a sigh that clouded the glass, Johnny decided to venture out. Perhaps a walk would alleviate the city's weight. He stood, grabbed his backpack, and headed for the door, sensing a shift in the day's ordinary routine. He carefully placed the book into his backpack before heading out.

**Scene 2: Johnny walks home from school,...** dodging a skateboarder weaving recklessly through the afternoon crowd. The air tasted like exhaust, a familiar but unpleasant flavor. He pulled his worn backpack tighter to his chest, a small comfort against the rough, grey world pressing in on him.

The sidewalk was a chaotic river of legs and shopping bags. A woman in bright pink leggings nearly clipped him with her oversized purse. "Watch it, kid!" she snapped, not even slowing down. Johnny mumbled an apology, even though it wasn't really his fault, and squeezed closer to the brick wall of a deli. The smell of salami, usually enticing, just felt heavy and overwhelming today.

He navigated around a cluster of pigeons pecking at a discarded pretzel, wrinkling his nose at the flapping wings and cooing noises. Even the city's birds seemed aggressive, constantly vying for scraps in a never-ending competition.

Then he saw it, plastered on a lamppost: a brightly coloured poster depicting a smiling clown juggling flaming torches. Beneath the clown, bold letters screamed: "The Great Alberto's Circus! Coming Soon!" Johnny stared at the image, a flicker of something he couldn't quite name sparking in his chest. Circuses were... exciting, weren't they? He'd only ever seen them on TV. But the noise, the crowds, the bright lights… It all felt a bit much, even just imagining it.

He sighed, the sound lost in the rumble of a passing bus. He readjusted his grip on his backpack and continued his walk, the poster fading from his mind. As he turned the corner onto Elm Street, a flash of pink – much brighter than the lady's leggings – caught his eye near a delivery truck. He paused, squinting, unsure of what he was seeing. The sheer absurdity of such a vibrant colour in this drab landscape was intriguing. He reasoned that, at the very least, it would be a welcome distraction from the monotony of his usual route home. Curiosity piqued, and a sense of adventure bubbling to the surface, Johnny decided to investigate the source of the unusual colour. Drawn by the unusual sight and the promise of something different, he turned down the alley to get a closer look. Little did he know, this detour would lead to an encounter that would change his day, and perhaps, his life.

**Scene 3: Johnny bumps into something la...**

The setting sun cast long shadows down Elm Street, momentarily darkening the entrance to the alley as Johnny approached. The air suddenly felt cooler, a stark contrast to the stuffy street. He hesitated for a moment, a prickle of unease raising the hairs on the back of his neck. He briefly wondered if he should just continue home, but the lure of the unknown, that splash of vibrant pink beckoning from the darkness, was too strong to resist. Taking a deep breath, he stepped into the alley.

The alley behind Sweet Surrender bakery reeked of burnt sugar and stale dough, a cloying sweetness that usually made Johnny’s stomach churn. Today, though, the smell was almost welcome; it masked the other, less pleasant odors of the city – the greasy exhaust fumes and the ever-present hint of something vaguely rotting. He shuffled through the narrow space, kicking a loose piece of crumbling brick, more lost in thought than paying attention to where he was going.

Suddenly, *thump*.

Johnny stumbled forward, his backpack slipping off his shoulder. He groaned, more upset about his scraped knee than the contents of his backpack spilling. "Great," he muttered, pushing himself up. "Just great." He scrambled to gather his belongings, making sure his picture book, "Old MacDonald's Farm," was still safe.

He turned to see what he'd bumped into. It was… large. And pink. And seemingly blocking the entire alley. At first, Johnny thought someone had dumped a particularly hideous, misshapen sofa. It was covered in a fine layer of alley dust, clinging to what looked like… wrinkles?

He cautiously circled the… *thing*. It was definitely soft, yielding slightly under his tentative poke. It smelled faintly of mud, a completely alien scent in this concrete jungle. He squinted, trying to make sense of the contours. There were… legs? Four of them? Short, stumpy legs. And a… tail?

Johnny’s breath caught in his throat. He leaned closer, his eyes widening. Now he could see it – the broad, flat snout, the small, almost hidden eyes blinking slowly, the ridiculously large ears that twitched with a lazy indifference.

"No way," he whispered, his voice barely audible above the rumble of a delivery truck passing on the street. He reached out a trembling hand and gently touched the dusty, pink skin. It was warm. Alive.

This wasn’t a discarded sofa. This was… a pig. A real, live, actual pig. Right here, in the alley behind Sweet Surrender bakery.

The pig grunted softly, a low rumble that vibrated through Johnny’s fingertips. It shifted its weight slightly, and Johnny, still mesmerized, took a step back. What was a pig doing here? In the city? In this *alley*?

He glanced around nervously. What if someone saw him? What if the owner came looking? He needed to… do something. But what? He looked at the pig, its eyes half-closed, seemingly content to continue its bizarre nap in the urban wilderness. An idea sparked in Johnny’s mind, crazy but wonderful.

He reached out again, this time not with fear, but with a strange, burgeoning sense of… hope. "Hey," he whispered to the pig. "Hey, buddy. You wanna come with me?" He didn't wait for an answer, already imagining the chaos, the impossible joy, that having a pig in his apartment might bring. He just knew, somehow, that this pig, this absurd and misplaced creature, was exactly what he needed.

He took another step closer, ready to lead this pink anomaly into the heart of his city life.

**Scene 4: Arnie, a pig with a penchant f...** for rhythmn**

The alley behind Sweet Surrender reeked of warm sugar and something vaguely burnt. Johnny held Arnie’s makeshift leash – a length of twine pilfered from his backpack – a little tighter. He noticed a faded tag clipped onto Arnie's ear, common on farm animals, and wondered where he had escaped from. The narrow space, usually deserted, felt claustrophobic with a pig the size of a small washing machine beside him. He was acutely aware of the rhythmic thumping emanating from Sweet Surrender's open back door, carrying with it a sugary-sweet scent that made his stomach rumble.

Suddenly, Arnie tensed. His ears perked up, swiveling like radar dishes towards the bakery door. His snuffling increased in volume, becoming a series of excited snorts. Arnie began pawing the ground with his front hooves, kicking up dust and small pebbles. He seemed restless, agitated by something Johnny couldn't quite place.

"Easy, Arnie," Johnny murmured, tugging gently on the twine. "What's got you so worked up?"

He listened more closely to the rhythmic thumping. It wasn't just general noise from the bakery; there was a distinct beat, a pulse that seemed to vibrate through the very ground beneath their feet. It was a catchy pop tune, the same one Johnny sometimes heard blaring from passing cars.

Arnie took a few tentative steps toward the bakery door, pulling against the twine. He let out a series of short, insistent grunts, his gaze fixed on the source of the sound. He shuffled his weight from one foot to the other.

"You smell something good in there, huh?" Johnny asked, surprised. He hadn't considered Arnie might be drawn to the source of the baking smells, the sweet scent intensifying his hunger.

He decided to test a theory. Johnny started to mimic eating, exaggerated chewing motions, pointing towards the bakery. Arnie's ears twitched, and his snorting became more rhythmic, almost mirroring Johnny's chewing. He took another step, then another, his hooves clicking against the pavement.

"Huh," Johnny said, a slow smile spreading across his face. "I think you're hungry, buddy."

Johnny stopped chewing, and Arnie immediately stilled, his gaze questioning. He let out a soft, disappointed grunt.

"Okay, okay," Johnny chuckled. "Just testing. But we can't stay here all day. Someone might see us." He tugged gently on the twine. "Come on, Arnie. Let's find a place where you can enjoy the… whatever they're baking… without getting caught."

**Scene 5: Johnny decides to lead Arnie b...**

Johnny bit his lip, glancing around. The lunchtime crowd was starting to thin, but he still needed a plan. "We gotta get you… somewhere safe. Away from all this noise."

Arnie, oblivious to Johnny's internal turmoil, let out a contented grunt and nudged Johnny’s leg with his snout.

“No, no eating trash!” Johnny pulled the wrapper away. “Bad pig! Come on.” He slipped the end of his worn-out shoelace through Arnie's ear tag. It wasn’t ideal, but it was the best he could do.

Arnie, naturally, did not.

Johnny tugged gently. “Walk. Heel. Sort of.” Arnie responded by digging his hooves into the cracked sidewalk, stubbornly resisting.

"Ugh." Johnny crouched down. "Look, if you don't come with me, you'll get caught. Someone will call Animal Control, and they'll take you back to… I don’t know where. Maybe… maybe you were part of some… art installation? Yeah! Some kind of… performance art. But it ended, and they just left you here. Or… or maybe you escaped from Evergreen Farms. That’s gotta be it. You were headed to market, but you took a wrong turn. A *very* wrong turn."

Seeing Arnie’s ears twitch but otherwise remaining impassive, Johnny pressed on, deciding to play on the pig's possible desires instead. "I know a place… it's got soft things to lie on, maybe even some leftover scraps nobody will mind you eating." He painted a tempting picture. "But we have to be quick, and quiet. Can you do that, Arnie?"

Arnie seemed to consider this, snuffling thoughtfully. Then, he took a tentative step forward, then another. The shoelace leash was taut. Johnny stood up, relief washing over him. It wasn’t a guarantee, but it was enough.

The journey began as a series of jerky starts and stops. Arnie was fascinated by everything – fire hydrants, discarded newspapers, even the grates over subway entrances. Each new attraction threatened to bring their progress to a screeching halt.

Johnny, acutely aware of the stares they were attracting, tried to keep Arnie moving. "Come on, boy! Good boy!" He pulled Arnie close as they navigated a busy crosswalk, the blare of horns and the screech of tires adding to his anxiety. He could feel the hot exhaust fumes sting his nostrils and taste the gritty city air on his tongue.

A woman with a brightly colored scarf gasped, pointing at Arnie. "Is that... a pig? What's a pig doing in the city?"

Johnny's cheeks burned. He shrugged, feigning nonchalance. "I dunno," he said, trying to sound casual. "Maybe it escaped from somewhere. I'm just... helping him find his way." He tugged Arnie forward, hoping she wouldn't press the issue. The woman looked at him skeptically. "Helping him? You're going to get in trouble, you know. That thing probably isn't even allowed in the city."

They squeezed past a group of teenagers laughing and talking loudly, the boom of their music making Arnie squeal in alarm. Johnny patted Arnie's flank reassuringly. "It's okay, buddy. Just a little further." One of the teens gave them a weird look and muttered something to his friends, who snickered.

Finally, they reached the entrance to Johnny's apartment building, a grimy brick structure that smelled faintly of stale garbage and cooking oil. He glanced nervously at the doorman, a burly man named Tony who always seemed to be scowling. Luckily, Tony was engrossed in a crossword puzzle.

“Okay, Arnie, quiet now,” Johnny hissed, pushing open the heavy glass door. “Operation: Pig-in-Apartment is a go.”

**Scene 6: Johnny manages to sneak Arnie ...**

Johnny took a quick glance at Tony, who was still concentrating on his puzzle, oblivious to the pig that had just entered the building. Heart pounding, Johnny ushered Arnie towards the elevators, thankful that none of the other residents were around. He jabbed the call button repeatedly, impatience gnawing at him with each passing second. When the doors finally slid open with a *ding*, Johnny breathed a sigh of relief and led Arnie inside.

Johnny held his breath as the elevator doors pinged open on their floor. He glanced down at Arnie, who was surprisingly cooperative, his head low. Johnny prayed no one would come out of their apartment.

“Okay, Arnie, quiet as a… as a mouse,” he whispered, pushing the door open slowly. He peeked inside. Empty. Relief loosened the tension in his shoulders.

He ushered Arnie inside, the pig's hooves clicking softly on the linoleum floor. The apartment smelled faintly of his mom’s lavender laundry detergent and something metallic, probably leftover from last night’s dinner.

“Phew,” Johnny breathed, closing the door. Arnie gave a soft oink and nuzzled Johnny’s hand. “Okay, okay, you’re safe now. Almost.”

He gently guided Arnie through the living room, maneuvering him around the worn sofa and his dad's newspaper. Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating dust particles. It looked peaceful, considering the porcine guest.

Johnny’s bedroom door was ajar. He pushed it open wider. It was his sanctuary, a cluttered space filled with comic books, Lego creations, and grape bubblegum. Perfect for hiding a pig, he thought.

"Alright, Arnie, welcome to your… temporary home,” Johnny announced. Arnie sniffed at the rug, then ambled over to Johnny’s beanbag chair, nudging it.

Johnny rummaged in his backpack and pulled out the cheese crackers and apple slices he’d salvaged from his lunchbox, placing them in a bowl he usually used for Lego pieces. Arnie, eyes gleaming, wasted no time in attacking the offering. Cracker crumbs flew, and the apple slices disappeared quickly.

"Easy there, champ," Johnny chuckled, watching Arnie devour the food. He felt a warmth spread through him, a sensation he hadn’t realized he was missing. He wasn't alone. He had a friend.

He settled onto his bed, watching Arnie munch contentedly. The afternoon sun warmed his face. For the first time in a long time, Johnny felt a flicker of genuine happiness. He reached out and scratched Arnie behind the ears. The pig let out a satisfied grunt and leaned into his touch.

But the peace was fragile. Every creak of the building, every distant siren, made Johnny jump. What if his parents came home early? What would he say? He imagined his mom's horrified expression, his dad's booming voice. A knot tightened in his stomach.

He glanced at the clock on his bedside table. 3:30 PM. That gave him… two and a half hours before dinner, at least.

He took a deep breath. He would enjoy these next few hours. He would make them count. He looked at Arnie, happily munching on the last of the apple slices. He was curious to see how Arnie would react, grabbing his favorite pop song CD and headed for the old boombox in the corner.

"Okay, Arnie," Johnny said, a mischievous glint in his eye.

## Chapter 2: Secrets and City Adventures

**Scene 1: Johnny introduces Arnie to his...**

"Ta-da!" Johnny exclaimed, pulling back a thick curtain of overgrown ivy. Sunlight, momentarily blinding, spilled onto the small, neglected patch of land behind the apartment building. To Johnny, it was a jungle, a secret garden, a world away from the concrete and car horns of the city. To anyone else, it was just a weedy mess.

Arnie, perched precariously on Johnny's shoulder, blinked, his large, inquisitive eyes taking in the scene. Dandelions pushed their sunny faces through cracks in the cracked concrete. A rusty, forgotten swing set stood sentinel in one corner, its chains creaking softly in the breeze. The air hummed with the buzz of unseen insects and smelled faintly of damp earth and something vaguely floral.

"This is it," Johnny announced proudly, lowering Arnie carefully to the ground. "My secret backyard. Nobody ever comes back here. It’s… perfect."

Arnie, slightly unsteady on his feet, wobbled a little. He was growing so fast! He took a tentative step, his oversized sneakers squishing a dandelion flat. He looked up at Johnny, a question in his bright eyes.

Johnny grinned. "Okay, lesson one!" He clapped his hands together. "Today, we learn the Piggy Pirouette!"

Arnie tilted his head, confused.

"It's easy!" Johnny assured him. He pointed to Arnie's somewhat stumpy legs. "Think of your… trotters. Like a pig, right? You stand on one foot, and then you use the other to… sort of… spin around! Like this!"

Johnny demonstrated, his skinny legs wobbling slightly as he spun in a clumsy circle, giggling as he nearly lost his balance. He recovered with a flourish. "See? Piggy Pirouette!"

Arnie watched intently, absorbing every move. He took a deep breath and attempted to imitate Johnny, but instead, he stumbled forward, nearly tripping over a stray root. He let out a small, frustrated squeak.

Johnny rushed to his side. "Woah, careful! It takes practice. Here, hold my hand."

He gently grasped Arnie's much larger hand, the rough skin surprisingly soft. Together, they tried again. Johnny guided Arnie's clumsy steps, singing a silly tune he made up on the spot about pigs and pirouettes. Slowly, Arnie began to get the hang of it, his movements still awkward, but undeniably a pirouette.

Sunlight filtered through the leaves, dappling their faces in golden light. Laughter echoed in the small, secret space, a melody of friendship blooming amidst the weeds and rust. Johnny felt a warmth spread through him, a feeling of pure, unadulterated joy. He glanced at Arnie, who was concentrating fiercely on his footing, a small smile playing on his lips.

“You’re getting it, Arnie! You’re doing it!” Johnny cheered, clapping enthusiastically.

Arnie managed a wobbly, but successful, pirouette. He looked up at Johnny, his eyes sparkling with pride. He let out a series of happy grunts.

Johnny beamed. "Perfect! Now, tomorrow, we try the Chicken Cha-Cha!" As he said it, a shadow fell across their little stage. Johnny's smile faltered. He turned to see Mrs. Rodriguez, the landlady, peering at them from the edge of the ivy. Her eyes narrowed, and Johnny knew, just knew, that their secret was about to get a whole lot more complicated.

**Scene 2: The pair sneak out of the apar...**

Johnny peered through the apartment building's grimy lobby windows. "Coast is clear, Arnie. Let's go, but be quiet!"

Arnie, already buzzing with pent-up energy, strained against the makeshift leash Johnny had fashioned from an old jump rope. He was getting too big for this. His scales, a dazzling emerald green, now rippled with muscle. Hiding him under Johnny’s oversized hoodie was becoming a serious challenge.

Johnny carefully opened the lobby door, scanning the sidewalk. A delivery guy lugged boxes across the street. A woman with a yappy poodle navigated the narrow pavement. "Okay, fast and quiet. Stick to the shadows."

He led Arnie towards the nearby city park, a green oasis crammed between towering buildings. The park was bustling with people – office workers on lunch breaks, families with young children, and the ubiquitous street performers.

“Remember the rules, buddy,” Johnny whispered, his voice tight with nervous excitement. “Stay low, stay quiet, and absolutely no… incidents.”

Arnie seemed to understand, though his massive tail swished back and forth with undisguised enthusiasm. They skirted the main pathways, sticking to the overgrown edges of flowerbeds and thick clumps of bushes. The air was thick with the smell of freshly cut grass, exhaust fumes, and something sweet and vaguely floral.

They reached a relatively secluded patch of flowers near the edge of the park. Bright red tulips and vibrant yellow daffodils poked their heads up towards the sun. Arnie, captivated by the colours, lumbered towards them.

"Arnie, no!" Johnny hissed, grabbing the jump rope.

Too late. Arnie, with a single, powerful swipe of his clawed hand, had dug up a significant chunk of the flower bed. A cascade of dirt and startled tulips showered the surrounding area.

Panic flared in Johnny's chest. He glanced around frantically. Luckily, no one seemed to have noticed yet.

"Arnie! What did I tell you?" He grabbed the dislodged flowers and desperately tried to replant them, shoving clumps of dirt back into the hole. His hands trembled as he patted the soil down, trying to disguise the damage. It looked… worse.

The rich, loamy smell of the disturbed earth filled the air. Arnie, oblivious to the trouble he'd caused, nudged Johnny with his snout, a low, rumbling purr vibrating in his chest.

“Shhh! Don't purr, you overgrown lizard!” Johnny whispered fiercely. He gave the mutilated flowerbed one last, despairing look. “Come on, we have to get out of here. Now!”

He yanked on the jump rope and practically dragged Arnie away from the scene of the floral crime. As they hurried towards a less populated part of the park, Johnny could hear the faint sound of laughter in the distance, followed by a high-pitched shriek of, "Look, Mama! The funny dog buried the flowers!"

Johnny’s stomach dropped. He knew they couldn't stay here. This secret was getting harder and harder to keep. He needed a better plan.

**Scene 3: Back in Johnny's room, Johnny ...**

Johnny wrestled an oversized fedora onto Arnie's head, the brim flopping down over his eyes. “Okay, Arnie, operation ‘Blend-In’ is a go! With this disguise,” he pointed to a pair of child-sized sunglasses precariously perched on Arnie's snout, “nobody will suspect a thing. You look… totally human!”

Arnie blinked, the dark lenses reflecting the glow of Johnny’s desk lamp. The room, usually a whirlwind of Lego castles and scattered comic books, had been hastily reorganized. Johnny's bed, draped with a camouflage patterned blanket, served as a makeshift fort. The air smelled faintly of plastic and the bubblegum Johnny had been chewing.

“Now, remember the rules,” Johnny said, pulling a small, plastic teacup from a miniature tea set on a tiny table he’d dragged from his sister’s room. “Humans sit at tables… like *this*.” He carefully positioned himself in a miniature chair, his knees nearly touching his chin. “And they drink tea… politely.” He mimed sipping from the teacup, his pinky extended.

Arnie watched him, tilting his head. He reached a clawed hand toward the teapot, a mischievous glint in his reptilian eyes.

“No, no, no! Arnie, gentle!” Johnny yelped, grabbing the teapot just before Arnie could upend it. He refilled the tiny cups with imaginary tea. “Now, you pick up the cup… slowly…”

Arnie snatched the cup, not slowly at all, and proceeded to dump the “tea” all over his head. Water droplets, imagined or otherwise, glistened on his scales. He let out a contented gurgle.

Johnny groaned. "Arnie! That's not how humans do it!" He grabbed a dish towel (his mother's best hand towel, he realized with a pang of guilt) and began mopping up the mess. "We're trying to keep you a secret here! You can’t just go around pouring pretend tea on yourself!"

Arnie, oblivious to Johnny’s mounting frustration, grabbed a plastic scone from the tea set and began gnawing on it. A corner of the scone snapped off and bounced onto the floor.

“Okay, new plan,” Johnny sighed, abandoning the tea set. “Maybe we'll work on ‘sitting still’ tomorrow. Today… we need to find a better hiding spot for you.” He glanced nervously towards the door, half-expecting his parents to burst in at any moment. The secret felt heavier now, a constant weight in his stomach. He scooped Arnie up, hat still askew and sunglasses clinging precariously to his snout. "Come on, secret agent. Time for a new mission." The last ray of sunlight disappeared as he approached the window, and as he looked outside, he spotted Mrs. Peterson from next door watering her flowers in the garden, and Johnny drew his curtains shut quickly. He knew keeping Arnie hidden was going to be even harder now.

**Scene 4: Johnny's mom, Sarah, notices J...**

The scent of cinnamon and freshly baked bread filled the small kitchen. Sunlight streamed through the window above the sink, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Sarah, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, hummed along to the radio as she sliced a loaf of bread, the rhythmic *thunk* of the knife against the cutting board a comforting sound.

Johnny burst into the kitchen, a whirlwind of energy. His cheeks were flushed, his eyes sparkling. He grabbed an apple from the fruit bowl, almost knocking it over in his haste.

"Hey, Mom!" he said, taking a huge bite. Apple juice dribbled down his chin.

Sarah stopped slicing, her brow furrowing slightly. "Hey, yourself. You seem… awfully cheerful today. More than usual." She leaned against the counter, observing him. "What's got you so excited, kiddo?"

Johnny chewed rapidly, his eyes darting around the room. He wiped his chin with the back of his hand, leaving a sticky streak. "Just… been playing a new game."

"A new game, huh?" Sarah's voice was laced with playful skepticism. She picked up a dishtowel and started wiping down the already spotless countertop. "What kind of game? One that involves you disappearing for hours on end and coming back looking like you've run a marathon?"

He swallowed hard. The apple suddenly felt like a lead weight in his stomach. "Uh… yeah! It's… really active. You know, running around, hiding… stuff like that." He tried to sound casual, but his voice cracked slightly.

Sarah raised an eyebrow, her gaze unwavering. "Hiding from what, exactly?"

Johnny fumbled for an answer. "Uh… bad guys! Pretend bad guys! It's… super fun." He gave a weak smile, hoping it looked convincing.

Sarah studied him for a long moment, her expression unreadable. The radio DJ chattered in the background, the cheerful music a stark contrast to the rising tension in the room. She saw the way his eyes kept shifting, the nervous fidgeting in his hands. Something was definitely up.

She sighed, a small, almost imperceptible sound. "Okay, Johnny," she said finally, her voice softening. "Just be careful, okay? And maybe… invite your friends over sometime. I haven't seen Liam or Maya in ages."

Johnny's shoulders visibly relaxed. "Yeah, Mom. Sure thing." He grabbed another apple, a little less enthusiastically this time, and mumbled, "Gotta go! See ya later!" He practically bolted out of the kitchen, leaving Sarah alone with her thoughts.

Sarah watched him go, her brow still furrowed. She knew he wasn't telling her the whole story. The “new game” explanation felt flimsy, almost insulting. She sighed again, a deeper, more troubled sound this time. Maybe she was just being an overprotective mother. But something felt different, unusual. She decided not to press him further, for now. But she knew she'd be keeping a close eye on her son. She had a feeling whatever “game” Johnny was playing, it was much bigger than he was letting on. She turned back to her baking, the sweet scent of cinnamon doing little to ease the prickle of unease at the back of her neck.

**Scene 5: Johnny takes Arnie to a back a...**

The alley reeked of stale grease and rotting vegetables. Flies buzzed lazily around overflowing dumpsters, their metallic shimmer catching the afternoon sun that barely penetrated the narrow space between the brick buildings. Johnny wrinkled his nose, pulling the collar of his t-shirt higher. "Okay, Arnie, stay close," he whispered, glancing around nervously. He kept Arnie tucked behind his legs, the extra material of Johnny's baggy jeans doing little to disguise the unusual bulk.

Arnie, ever curious, peered around Johnny's leg, his large eyes wide and taking in the grimy scene. He seemed less bothered by the smell than Johnny was.

They edged closer to the restaurant's back door, hoping someone might have tossed out scraps. Johnny noticed a discarded cardboard box overflowing with wilted lettuce and half-eaten bread crusts. "Jackpot," he murmured, a surge of relief washing over him. He was starving, and so, undoubtedly, was Arnie.

Suddenly, a low growl rumbled from the shadows. A scrawny, ginger cat with matted fur and one ear torn nearly in half emerged, its back arched, eyes narrowed into angry slits. Its tail twitched violently.

"Uh oh," Johnny muttered, freezing. He knew better than to mess with a stray cat defending its territory. This one looked particularly mean. He took a step back, pulling Arnie with him. "Easy there, kitty. We don't want any trouble."

The cat hissed, taking a step forward, its eyes fixed on Arnie. Johnny could feel Arnie trembling slightly behind him. He tightened his grip, ready to bolt if the cat attacked.

But then, something unexpected happened. Arnie, instead of cowering, let out a soft, chirping sound. It wasn't a meow, or a growl, but a melodic little trill. He edged forward, pushing gently against Johnny's leg.

The cat paused, its ears twitching. Its hostile posture seemed to soften, just a fraction. It blinked slowly, its eyes still narrowed, but the rigid tension in its body seemed to ease.

Arnie chirped again, a little louder this time, and took another tentative step forward. Johnny held his breath, his heart pounding.

To his utter astonishment, the cat lowered its head and rubbed against Arnie's leg, purring weakly. Arnie nudged the cat back with his head, a low rumble vibrating in his chest. The ginger cat responded by rubbing even harder against Arnie, weaving around his legs.

Johnny stared, dumbfounded. He'd expected a fight, not a friendship. Arnie, it seemed, had a way with even the grumpiest creatures.

"Wow," Johnny breathed, a smile spreading across his face. "You're amazing, Arnie." He cautiously reached into the box of discarded food and pulled out a piece of bread. He offered it to the cat, who snatched it from his hand and devoured it in seconds.

Arnie nudged Johnny's hand, as if to say, "See? I told you so."

For a moment, standing in the grimy alley, surrounded by the smells of decay, Johnny felt a sense of peace he hadn’t expected. Arnie had not only found a friend, but he had also proven that even in the most unlikely of places, kindness could bloom. He knew, though, that this secret alley trip, like all their adventures, was a dangerous game. Someone could see them. Someone could discover Arnie.

They needed to be more careful. Much more careful. He glanced around one more time, a knot of anxiety tightening in his stomach. "Come on, Arnie," he said, his voice low. "Let's get out of here before someone sees us." He scratched the ginger cat behind the ears. "See you later, kitty."

As they hurried out of the alley, Johnny couldn’t shake the feeling that their luck was running out. The city felt bigger and more menacing than ever.

**Scene 6: Johnny measures Arnie with a m...**

The afternoon sun streamed through Johnny's window, painting stripes of light across his posters of skateboarding legends. Dust motes danced in the golden beams, illuminating the cluttered landscape of his bedroom floor: scattered comics, discarded controllers, and half-finished drawings. He’d even swept the floor yesterday, a suspiciously clean habit that had earned him a raised eyebrow from his mom. All for Arnie.

Johnny held a tattered yellow measuring tape, the kind his grandma used for sewing. It wasn't ideal, but it was the best he could find. Arnie, perched awkwardly on Johnny’s beanbag chair, held perfectly still, his bright, curious eyes fixed on the tape. A low, rumbling purr vibrated through the small room.

"Okay, just hold still, buddy," Johnny murmured, stretching the tape from the top of Arnie’s head to his, admittedly oversized, feet. The numbers seemed to blur before his eyes. He repeated the measurement three times, each result more alarming than the last.

He scribbled the latest number – 3 foot, 8 inches – onto a scrap of paper, comparing it to last week's measurement. A week! In a week, Arnie had grown nearly two inches.

“This isn’t good, Arnie. Not good at all.” Johnny paced, the floorboards creaking under his weight. "At this rate, you'll be taller than me by Christmas! How am I supposed to explain *that* to my parents?"

Arnie tilted his head, seemingly oblivious to Johnny's growing panic. He stretched out a paw, batting playfully at a dangling shoelace.

Johnny ran a hand through his hair, feeling the familiar knot of anxiety tighten in his stomach. He'd been so focused on the fun, the secret adventures, the sheer joy of having Arnie, that he hadn’t fully grasped the logistical nightmare unfolding. He'd imagined hiding a puppy, not a rapidly expanding... *whatever Arnie was*.

He glanced around the room, his sanctuary, now feeling claustrophobically small. The closet, already packed with forgotten clothes and dusty boxes, was Arnie’s daytime hideout. It was getting tighter in there. His parents were bound to notice something eventually. They were already suspicious about the extra food vanishing from the fridge.

"I don't know what I'm going to do," Johnny whispered, his voice cracking slightly.

Arnie, sensing Johnny's distress, hopped off the beanbag chair and padded towards him, his large, soft head nudging against Johnny’s leg. The familiar, comforting rumble vibrated through Johnny's bones.

He knelt down, wrapping his arms tightly around Arnie’s warm, furry body. The scent of sun-baked fur and something earthy, wild, filled his nostrils. A rush of overwhelming affection mixed with a sharp, stinging fear. He loved Arnie more than anything, more than skateboarding, more than video games, even more than pizza.

But love wasn’t enough to solve this problem. Love didn't make Arnie smaller.

He hugged Arnie tighter, burying his face in his fur. "I’ll figure it out," he mumbled, the words muffled by Arnie's fur. "I promise I will." He squeezed his eyes shut, a single tear escaping and dampening Arnie's fur. He had to. He just didn't know how.
