    "worldbuilding": {
        "geography": "The story takes place in the fictional city of Oakhaven, a bustling metropolis situated on the banks of the winding River Ash. Oakhaven is divided into distinct districts, including the older, historical district with cobblestone streets and brownstone buildings, a modern downtown with towering skyscrapers and glass facades, and quieter residential neighborhoods with tree-lined avenues. The city is nestled in a valley, surrounded by rolling hills that are slowly giving way to suburban sprawl. To the east of Oakhaven lies the sprawling Evergreen Farms region, a patchwork of agricultural land that supplies much of the city's food. This is where Arnie's original farm is located. Small pockets of natural areas, such as Oakhaven Central Park and the Ash River Greenway, provide limited green spaces within the city limits. Oakhaven experiences a temperate climate with four distinct seasons. Summers are warm and humid, with average temperatures in the low 80s Fahrenheit. Winters are cold and snowy, with temperatures often dipping below freezing. Spring and autumn are mild and pleasant, with vibrant foliage displays. The river plays a significant role in moderating the city's climate, creating microclimates in certain areas and occasionally causing dense fog in the mornings. Unexpected flash floods along the River Ash are also a potential hazard due to outdated infrastructure. Beyond the districts of Oakhaven, the surrounding region includes smaller towns and villages scattered throughout Evergreen Farms. Maplewood, a quaint village known for its annual Maple Syrup Festival, is a popular weekend getaway destination for Oakhaven residents. The Blackwood Forest, a dense and ancient woodland rumored to be haunted, lies to the north of Oakhaven and serves as a source of local legends and campfire stories.",

Oakhaven residents generally value hard work, family, and community. A strong emphasis is placed on individual achievement and success, but there is also a growing awareness of social responsibility and environmental sustainability.
