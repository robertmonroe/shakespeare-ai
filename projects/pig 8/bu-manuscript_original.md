# Hog Wild: A Graceland Pig Tale

## By Unknown Author

**Genre:** Young Adult

## Chapter 1: From Oink to King

**Scene 1: We are introduced to Percy, a ...** genetically modified pig, as he listlessly nudged at a pile of suspiciously green slop. The air hung thick and heavy, a humid blanket woven with the scent of manure, stale feed, and the general funk of a hundred disgruntled hogs. Sunlight, already past its morning prime, beat down on the corrugated metal roof of Farmer McGregor's barn, amplifying the heat in the already sweltering pigpen.

Around him, the other pigs grunted and snuffled, their pink hides coated in a thick layer of mud, oblivious to anything beyond the immediate gratification of shoving their snouts deeper into the trough. They were content. Blissfully, tragically, content.

Percy, however, felt a persistent itch beneath his bristly skin, a restlessness that the mud couldn’t soothe and the slop couldn’t satisfy.

He pushed the slop aside with his snout. It had the texture of wallpaper paste and smelled vaguely of old gym socks. He shuddered. He much preferred the slightly overripe melons that sometimes, *sometimes*, found their way into the mix.

"Oink?" came a low, guttural sound from Beatrice, the sow who usually managed to bully her way to the best spot in the trough. She was a behemoth, a mountain of pig flesh, and currently blocking Percy’s access to a particularly promising-looking chunk of… something unidentifiable.

Percy sighed, a puff of air that stirred the dust devils dancing in the mud. He couldn't even muster the energy to fight her. What was the point? Another grunt, another shove, another mouthful of mediocre slop. His life was a carefully calibrated exercise in bovine… no, *porcine* monotony.

He turned away from the trough, the grunts and slurps fading slightly as he moved towards the edge of the pen. He could see a sliver of the outside world through the gaps in the weathered wooden planks: a patch of emerald-green pasture, a line of distant trees shimmering in the heat haze, and beyond that, a vast, unknowable horizon.

His heart, usually a sluggish, pig-like organ, gave a small, hopeful thump.

He longed for that horizon. He longed for *something*. Anything. Anything that wasn't this.

He slumped against the fence, the rough wood scraping against his flank. He closed his eyes, and for a moment, he imagined himself anywhere but here.

He didn’t belong in this pen, with these pigs, eating this… this *stuff*. He was destined for something more.

The oppressive sameness of the pigpen seemed to amplify his yearning for something beyond its confines. Days bled into weeks, each indistinguishable from the last, until a chance discovery offered a glimmer of hope amidst the monotony. **But the universe, it seemed, had a surprise in store for Percy, something hidden in the forgotten corners of the farm that would change everything. Little did he know, a dusty relic held the key to unlocking a world beyond the pigpen, a world of music and dreams just waiting to be discovered.**

**Scene 2: Percy discovers an old, dusty ... Radio**

The barn smelled of hay and pig. Mostly pig. Percy wrinkled his snout as he rooted around in the back corner. It was darker here, the sunlight struggling to penetrate the thick layer of dust clinging to the warped wooden planks. The other piglets avoided this corner; rumored to be haunted by the ghost of Old Bess, the prize-winning sow who'd choked on an apple core years ago. Percy, however, felt drawn to it. An odd pull, like a tiny, insistent tickle in his curly tail.

He pushed past a stack of moldering feed sacks, sending a small cloud of dust motes dancing in the faint light. And then he saw it.

An old radio. It was a bulky thing, all rounded edges and tarnished chrome. The cloth grill, once probably a vibrant color, was now faded and riddled with holes. It sat on a wobbly, three-legged stool, seemingly forgotten. The radio had been left in the pigpen because Farmer McGregor was in the hospital. A nasty bout of pneumonia had put him there unexpectedly, and in the rush, his wife hadn't the heart to move the radio from where he liked to listen to the ballgame while tending to the animals.

Percy cautiously approached. He circled it, snorting softly. It was unlike anything he’d ever seen. Everything on the farm was designed for a purpose: troughs for eating, mud wallows for cooling, fences for containing. This…this looked like it served no practical purpose at all. It just *sat* there.

He nudged it with his snout. Nothing. Just a faint *clunk* as the stool wobbled precariously. He nudged it again, harder this time. The radio teetered, then settled back with a sigh.

“Hello?” Percy squealed, his voice a high-pitched squeak that echoed in the barn. He knew it was a foolish question. What was a radio going to do? Answer?

He kept nudging. He liked the solid feel of the cold metal against his snout. He found a loose wire hanging from the back and sniffed it tentatively. It smelled faintly of… ozone? Electricity? He wasn't sure, but it was a sharp, unfamiliar scent that made his whiskers twitch.

He persevered, snorting and pushing until the radio was almost off the stool. Then, something miraculous happened.

A faint crackle.

Percy froze. He held his breath, listening intently. Another crackle, followed by a burst of static. He nudged the radio again, and the static grew louder, resolving into a garbled mix of voices and music. It was faint, barely audible, but it was there. A sound from… somewhere else. Somewhere beyond the mud wallows and the feed troughs and the endless expanse of Iowa cornfields.

Percy felt a surge of something he couldn’t quite name. Excitement? Hope? A desperate yearning for something more than the predictable rhythm of farm life? Whatever it was, it burned bright within him.

He pawed at the stool, trying to steady the radio. The static faded again, leaving only the oppressive silence of the barn. But the seed had been planted. He knew, with a certainty that resonated deep within his porcine soul, that this radio held the key to something important. He just had to figure out how to unlock it.

He looked back at the dusty machine, already plotting. Tomorrow, he’d bring the other piglets. Maybe, just maybe, they could help him understand this… this portal to another world. Maybe, together, they could find a way to make it sing again.

He went back to his pen, awaiting the next day where he would attempt to get it running again. The radio, a relic of a bygone era, became Percy's obsession. He spent every spare moment tinkering with it, trying to coax more than static from its ancient components. He needed to hear that music again. He knew tomorrow was the day it would happen.

With newfound determination churning within him, Percy could barely contain his excitement for the next day's attempt to revive the radio and unlock its musical secrets.

**Scene 3: While Percy is rooting around ...**

The sounds of the farm faded into a dull background hum as Percy focused all his energy on coaxing the radio to life once more. The anticipation was almost unbearable.

He had spent the night restless with anticipation. The mundane routines of the pigpen now seemed even more unbearable, each grunt and snort a frustrating distraction from the symphony he knew waited within the dusty radio. He couldn’t shake the feeling that unlocking the radio's secrets held the key to unlocking his own potential.

The usual barn symphony of snorts and rustling straw filled the air. Dust motes danced in the weak sunlight filtering through the grimy windows high above. Percy nudged the base of the old radio with his snout, its metal casing cool and rough against his skin. Boredom gnawed at him. He’d already exhausted his daily mud-wallowing quota and the trough held nothing new.

Suddenly, a crackle of static ripped through the quiet. The other pigs barely registered it, continuing their endless quest for overlooked kernels of corn. But Percy froze. The static intensified, then morphed into a driving, almost hypnotic beat.

*Wop-bop-a-loo-bop, wop-bam-boom!*

A voice, rich and throaty, a voice Percy had never heard before, filled the barn.

"You ain't nothin' but a hound dog, cryin' all the time…"

Elvis Presley.

Percy stood transfixed. The other pigs remained oblivious, snuffling and shoving. He, however, was rooted to the spot, his small, beady eyes glued to the speaker. The raw energy in the singer's voice resonated deep within him, a feeling he couldn’t explain, a feeling unlike anything he’d ever experienced.

"You ain't never caught a rabbit and you ain't no friend of mine."

The lyrics, a jumble of human words he didn't quite grasp, thrummed through him. He felt a strange pull, an urge to move, to *sing*. He shifted his weight, his hooves scraping against the concrete floor.

The King continued his lament, his voice filled with a swagger and a pain that both mystified and captivated Percy. He felt a tingle in his throat, an unfamiliar pressure building. He didn’t understand the words, but he understood the *feeling*.

Without conscious thought, Percy opened his mouth. A low, almost imperceptible sound escaped, a kind of grunt-hum. It wasn't singing, not really. But it was a start.

The song reached its crescendo, Elvis's voice soaring. Percy, emboldened, tried again. This time, the sound was louder, clearer. A strangled, pig-like… yodel? It was awful. Hideous, even. But it was *there*.

He stopped, embarrassed. He glanced around. Had the other pigs heard? Thankfully, they remained engrossed in their gluttonous pursuits, seemingly deaf to his… performance. He took a deep breath.

The song ended abruptly. Silence descended on the barn, broken only by the contented grunts of the other pigs. But for Percy, the silence was different. It was filled with the echo of Elvis, the lingering vibration of that strange, powerful voice. And within him, a seed had been planted. A seed of hope, of possibility. The next song to come on the radio was a slow ballad, and as it began, Percy knew he needed to find a way to practice without the other pigs noticing his attempts at singing. He had to find the space to explore this new talent.

This realization solidified Percy's resolve; he needed to embrace this newfound passion, even if it meant breaking free from the only world he'd ever known. He started formulating a plan, his mind buzzing with the possibilities that lay beyond the farm's fences, a plan that would require courage, cunning, and a whole lot of pig-headed determination.

**Scene 4: Overcome by the music, Percy t...**

The hay-dusted air vibrated. Elvis, via the ancient radio, was belting out "Hound Dog," his voice crackling with static and pure, unadulterated feeling. Percy, snout practically glued to the speaker, felt a strange tingling sensation starting in his trotters and working its way up his spine. He’d never felt anything like it. This wasn’t just music; it was… electricity.

He shifted uneasily, pushing aside a stray piece of straw. The other pigs were still snorting and rooting around in the mud pit outside, oblivious. They wouldn’t understand. This feeling, this… *longing*… it was something solely his.

The King hit a particularly high note, a wail that seemed to echo across the Iowa fields. Impulsively, without thinking, Percy opened his mouth.

A sound, hesitant and guttural, escaped. It was an attempt, a feeble imitation of Elvis’s power. He closed his eyes, willing himself to connect to the music, to the feeling. He tried again, pushing past the ingrained pig sounds, past the oinks and grunts, reaching for something more.

This time, something *sort of* different happened.

He tried to mimic the sounds, and what came out was more like, "*Uhhhh ain't nothin' but a... hnnn... hound dog*". He wasn't sure of all the words, but it was the right *feeling*! Percy's eyes snapped open. Had he… had *he* just…?

A gaggle of hens froze mid-scratch. Their beady eyes, usually focused on the ground, were now fixed on Percy with a mixture of shock and, dare he say it, amusement. One particularly plump hen clucked, a sound remarkably like a stifled giggle.

Percy swallowed hard, his throat suddenly dry. He tried again, this time with more confidence, but still not quite right.

"*Cryin' all the time... You ain't... umm... caught no rabbit? Ain't no friend...mine!*" He knew he wasn't getting it exactly right but some of it sounded right.

The voice, though coming from a pig, was trying so hard to be Elvis. The chickens, still captivated, started pecking rhythmically at the floor in time with the music.

Percy stared, a bit confused. He could *sort of* sing. Not just sing, but *sort of sing like Elvis*. This… this was *something*! This was *a* ticket out? He knew he would be laughed at if he tried to do this in the pen.

A wide, almost goofy grin spread across his snout. He threw his head back, taking a deep breath of the hay-scented air. He closed his eyes again, letting the music fill him, letting the King *influence* him.

This farm, this life of mud and slop and destined for the butcher... it wasn't for him.

The radio faded to static, ending the song. The chickens resumed their scratching, seemingly dismissing the extraordinary event that had just occurred. But for Percy, the world had irrevocably changed. He knew what he had to do.

He had a *sort of* voice. And he was going to use it. The next day would be a big one for him.

He turned towards the barn door, a newfound determination hardening his gaze. The sun was beginning to set, painting the fields in hues of orange and purple. He had a lot of planning to do, and not a lot of time. Tomorrow, the escape would begin, and he was going to get better.

As the twilight deepened, Percy's focus shifted from singing to strategizing; he needed a plan, a means of escape, and a place to practice his burgeoning talent away from the prying eyes (and ears) of the farm's inhabitants.

**Scene 5: Percy practices his Elvis impe...**

The mud in the pigpen squelched rhythmically under Percy’s hooves as he swayed, eyes squeezed shut. “You ain't nothin’ but a hound dog, cryin’ all the time…” His voice, surprisingly deep and resonant, echoed off the corrugated metal walls of the barn. He tried to inject more swagger into his stance, mimicking the moves he’d seen (or rather, heard described) by the late-night radio DJs.

He’d sneak away during Farmer McGregor’s naps, the Iowa sun beating down on the dusty farm. He’d practice in the least likely places: in the shadow of the grain silo, its metallic skin radiating heat; behind the rusting tractor, its tires overgrown with weeds; even submerged in the cool, green slime of the watering trough, only his snout above the surface, crooning a muffled "Love Me Tender."

Each day, he grew bolder, more confident. He’d fluff his sparse bristles into a makeshift pompadour using mud and stray bits of hay. He even managed to pilfer a scrap of blue fabric from the farmhouse washing line – now tied jauntily around his neck as a pseudo-scarf.

He dreamt of escape. No longer just a vague longing, but a concrete plan, fueled by a fiery ambition. He would leave this farm, the constant threat of the butcher, and he would become… a star.

That night, nestled amongst the other pigs, their snores a droning symphony of porcine contentment, Percy’s mind conjured a different tune. He was on a stage, bathed in blinding white spotlights. Thousands of faces blurred into a sea of adoration, their screams deafening, intoxicating. They were chanting his name – well, not Percy exactly. It was something… cooler. “The Swine King!” perhaps? Or maybe… “Elvis Pigsley!”

He was wearing a dazzling white jumpsuit, sequins shimmering with every swivel of his hips (which, admittedly, needed work). He held a microphone, shaped suspiciously like a corncob, and the crowd roared as he launched into "Jailhouse Rock."

He saw Graceland. Not the muddy sty he knew, but a majestic mansion, gleaming white, surrounded by lush green lawns. He was standing at the gates, a velvet rope parting before him, adoring fans pressing forward, thrusting autograph books and… and apples at him.

He woke with a jolt, the harsh reality of the pigpen crashing down. The smell of damp straw filled his nostrils, replacing the imagined scent of honeysuckle and hairspray. The other pigs grunted and shifted in their sleep, oblivious to the dreams of the rock ‘n’ roll revolution brewing beside them.

But the dream felt real. The ambition, the hunger, the certainty – it was all there, burning within him. The farmer still snored in the house. The sun was still rising. Percy, the genetically modified pig, had a show to put on. And he was getting out of this farm.

## Chapter 2: Rhinestones and Runaways

**Scene 1: Percy escapes the confines of ...** the livestock truck in a desperate scramble of flailing hooves and a spray of surprisingly fragrant hay. One minute he was crammed against a snoring sow the size of a small car, the next he was tumbling onto sun-baked asphalt, the roar of eighteen-wheelers a deafening symphony in his ears.

He scrambled to his feet, his curly tail twitching nervously. Gravel crunched under his hooves. Dust motes danced in the hazy air, stinging his eyes. Gone was the familiar smell of manure and muddy fields; replaced by the acrid tang of exhaust fumes and something faintly… metallic? He didn’t know. Everything was new and terrifying.

The truck, oblivious to its escaped passenger, rumbled onward, leaving Percy standing alone on a highway off-ramp. He was surrounded by a concrete jungle of overpasses and billboards, a far cry from the gentle green pastures he'd known his entire life.

A chain-link fence, crowned with razor wire that gleamed menacingly in the afternoon sun, ran parallel to the road. Beyond it, a tangle of weeds choked the dry earth. There was no sign of life, no friendly face, just the relentless whoosh of cars and trucks speeding past.

Percy let out a small, distressed oink. He wasn't sure where he was, or where he was going. He only knew he had to get away from the farm, away from… whatever they had planned for him. But now, standing here, alone and utterly lost, a wave of doubt crashed over him.

He took a tentative step forward, then another, sniffing the air cautiously. The asphalt was hot beneath his hooves, radiating heat that made his head swim. He shaded his eyes with a trot and scanned the horizon. Nothing but more concrete and steel. He felt a pang of homesickness, quickly followed by a surge of determination. He couldn’t go back. Not now. Not ever.

He pushed through the weeds at the edge of the off-ramp, trying to find some sort of path, some sign of where to go. The scratchy foliage snagged at his bristly fur. He stumbled, his little legs not quite accustomed to the uneven terrain.

A crumpled fast-food wrapper skittered across his path, propelled by a gust of wind. He watched it, mesmerized, a symbol of the strange, bewildering world he had suddenly found himself in.

He took a deep breath, trying to steady his racing heart. He had to find someone, anyone, who could help him. Maybe, just maybe, he could find a place where a pig with big dreams could actually belong. He started walking, his little hooves carrying him further and further away from the familiar, and deeper into the unknown. The distant neon glow of Memphis beckoned, a promise and a threat all rolled into one.

**Scene 2: Wandering aimlessly, Percy tri...**

The thrum of Beale Street felt miles away. The rhythmic pulse of the music Percy craved had faded to a faint whisper, replaced by the growl of distant traffic and the mournful cry of gulls circling overhead. He trotted down another cracked sidewalk, each footfall sending up puffs of gritty dust that clung to his damp fur. The sun, a hazy orange orb, beat down on his back, turning the already humid air thick and suffocating.

This wasn't Graceland. This wasn't the shimmering mecca he'd pictured in his head. This was… well, it smelled like fish and regret.

Warehouses loomed on either side, their brick facades crumbling under layers of peeling paint and grime. Broken windows stared out like empty sockets. A rusted chain-link fence, draped with tattered plastic bags, separated him from what looked like a loading dock, where a lone shopping cart lay overturned, its wheels spinning lazily in the breeze. The Mississippi River, a muddy, sluggish serpent, was visible between gaps in the buildings, its surface reflecting the fading light with a dull sheen.

Percy cocked his head, listening intently. He could *almost* hear it – a faint twang of a guitar, the distant beat of a drum. Hope, a fragile seedling, pushed its way through the concrete of his apprehension. He followed the sound, pushing past a pile of discarded tires and a mountain of cardboard boxes that smelled vaguely of onions.

He picked up his pace, his snout twitching. Maybe, just maybe, he was getting closer. The rhythmic thump became clearer, interspersed with a woman's voice, rough around the edges but full of soul.

He squeezed between two buildings, the brick cold against his flank. The alley reeked of urine and something vaguely chemical, but the music was louder now, much louder. He rounded a corner and saw it: a small, dilapidated building with a fire escape clinging precariously to its side. Faint light spilled from a grimy window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. And the music... the music was coming from inside.

Percy hesitated. He'd been warned about strangers. He’d been warned about *everything*. But the music… it tugged at something deep inside him, a longing he couldn't ignore. He took a deep breath, puffing out his chest. The Swine-King didn't cower. The Swine-King conquered.

He took another step, then another, his hooves clicking softly on the cracked pavement. He reached the window and, standing on his hind legs, peered inside.

**Scene 3: While trying to sneak a discar...**

While trying to sneak a discarded apple from a vendor’s cart, Percy tripped. His trotters, more accustomed to muddy fields than cracked pavement, splayed out from under him. He landed with a startled "Oof!" that sent a flock of pigeons fluttering skyward. The air, thick with the smell of hot dogs, exhaust fumes, and something vaguely floral (probably fake magnolias, he guessed), swam around him. Shame burned hotter than the midday sun beating down on his pink hide.

“Well, aren’t you a sight for sore eyes,” a voice drawled.

Percy, still scrambling to his feet, looked up. Standing over him was a girl, maybe sixteen, with a riot of purple hair held back by a bandana sporting a sequined Elvis silhouette. Her ripped jeans were adorned with more rhinestones than a Liberace piano, and a half-finished Elvis jumpsuit dangled precariously from her shoulder. She chewed gum with a deliberate, almost theatrical, slow motion.

Percy, normally brimming with witty (pig-witty, at least) repartee, was momentarily speechless. He simply stood there, apple (now bruised) still clutched in his hoof, staring.

The girl leaned closer, her eyes, the colour of faded denim, narrowing. “Never seen a talking pig before. And one dressed like…that.” She gestured vaguely at his ill-fitting jumpsuit. “What’s the story, porky?”

He gulped. The fruit vendor, a burly man with a scowl carved into his face, was eyeing him with suspicion. “Uh…I…I can explain?” Percy squeaked, his voice cracking mid-sentence. Desperation lent it a particularly mournful quality.

Daisy’s eyebrows shot up. “Did you just…sing?” She tilted her head, studying him like he was a particularly intriguing insect. “Sing *and* talk? You're hitting notes I haven't heard since the King himself. That squeak… that tremble… pure gold.”

He blushed, or at least, his hide deepened to a more alarming shade of pink. “I… I wouldn’t exactly call it singing.”

“Honey,” Daisy said, popping her gum, “that’s exactly what I’d call it. Diamond in the rough, that’s what you are. A rhinestone-encrusted, hog-wild diamond.” She glanced at the vendor, who was now reaching for a hefty-looking broom. “Come on, before Jimmy the Fruit Man tries to sweep you back to the farm.”

She grabbed his hoof, her grip surprisingly strong. Percy, still bewildered, allowed himself to be pulled away, the half-eaten apple tumbling onto the grimy sidewalk. He glanced back at the vendor, who was indeed brandishing his broom, then back at Daisy. Her eyes sparkled with an almost manic energy. He wasn't sure what he was getting into, but one thing was clear: life had just gotten a whole lot more interesting. And possibly, a whole lot more…sparkly.

**Scene 4: Daisy, intrigued by Percy's si...**

The air hung thick and heavy, a miasma of stale grease and damp cardboard. Percy wrinkled his nose, but the aroma was a marked improvement over the pig farm. Daisy had led him behind a boarded-up diner, the faded “EAT AT JOE’S!” sign a ghostly reminder of better days. Their camp was a makeshift affair: a scattering of flattened cardboard boxes arranged around a tattered blanket, offering a meager defense against the cool night air.

Daisy rummaged through a dented metal box, emerging triumphant with a half-eaten pack of crackers. “Peanut butter flavor,” she announced, offering it to Percy. “Best I can do tonight. Joe used to throw these out, said they attracted rats. Which, okay, they probably did. But free is free, right?”

Percy hesitated. He hadn’t eaten since… well, since he’d escaped. He cautiously took a cracker, the peanut butter a strange but welcome sweetness in his mouth. He devoured it in two bites.

“Thanks,” he mumbled, feeling a flicker of guilt. He hadn't told her about the singing yet, about Elvis. It all felt too ridiculous, too impossible.

Daisy watched him with kind eyes. She sat on the edge of the blanket, hugging her knees to her chest. The glow of a distant streetlight painted her face in shades of silver and shadow. “So,” she said, her voice soft, “that little Elvis impression back there… was that a one-time thing, or…?”

Percy blushed, the tips of his ears burning. “I… I like to sing. Elvis, mostly.”

“Mostly?” Daisy raised an eyebrow, a playful glint in her eyes.

He shifted uncomfortably. “Well, yeah. He’s… he’s everything. The hair, the voice, the… the moves.” Percy shuffled his feet, trying to explain something he barely understood himself. “It’s like… when I sing, I’m not just… Percy. I’m… someone else.”

He looked up, expecting Daisy to laugh, to call him crazy. Instead, she was studying him, a thoughtful expression on her face.

“Sing something for me,” she said, her voice barely a whisper.

Percy swallowed. He hadn't sung for anyone, truly sung, in… well, ever. He closed his eyes, picturing Elvis on stage, the lights, the roar of the crowd. He took a deep breath, trying to channel the King.

Then, hesitantly, he began.

“Well, since my baby left me,
I found a new place to dwell…”

His voice, rusty at first, grew stronger with each word. The melody filled the small space behind the diner, echoing off the boarded-up windows. He poured all his longing, all his hopes, into the song. He wasn't just singing; he was becoming.

When he finished, the silence was deafening. He opened his eyes, his heart pounding.

Daisy was still staring at him, but this time, her eyes were wide with something akin to awe. “Wow,” she breathed. “Okay, Swine-King… I think you might just have something.”

Swine-King. He liked the sound of that. A tiny spark of hope flickered within him, warming him from the inside out.

“Look, it’s not much,” Daisy said, gesturing around the camp with a sweep of her hand, “but you can stay here. With me. We can figure things out. I can help you… with your look, your image. I'm pretty good with a needle and thread, as you might have guessed." She winked.

Percy looked around the ramshackle shelter, at the dented box, the worn blanket, the kind face of this runaway girl. It wasn't Graceland, but it was a start. It was a chance.

“Okay,” he said, his voice hoarse with emotion. “Okay, Daisy. I’ll stay.”

He settled onto the blanket next to her, the cool night air suddenly feeling a little less cold, a little less lonely. He had a name, a friend, and maybe, just maybe, a future. The dream of singing like Elvis, of becoming the Swine-King, didn’t seem quite so impossible anymore. He closed his eyes, the faint smell of peanut butter crackers lingering in the air, and drifted off to sleep.

**Scene 5: Daisy, excited about Percy's p...**

Daisy hummed, a high-pitched, almost frantic buzz, as she paced the cracked asphalt behind the boarded-up diner. The air hung thick and heavy, smelling of stale grease and damp concrete. A single flickering streetlamp cast long, skeletal shadows, painting the scene in a bruised purple light. Percy, still a little dizzy from the bus ride and the sheer absurdity of the day, sat huddled on a discarded milk crate, watching her.

Daisy’s fingers flew across the worn surface of a sketchpad, a stubby pencil leaving trails of graphite in its wake. The only sound besides her humming was the occasional screech of a rat disappearing into the overgrown weeds bordering the parking lot. She chewed on her lower lip, her brow furrowed in concentration.

"Okay, okay, okay," she muttered, more to herself than to Percy. "Sideburns are a must, obviously. But…pig-style. Wider? Fluffier? Definitely rhinestones. LOTS of rhinestones." She gestured wildly with the pencil, nearly poking herself in the eye. "And the jumpsuit…forget the basic white. We're thinking…burnt umber? Chocolate brown? No, too…earthy. Gold! Gold lame, with ruby accents! Yes!"

Percy shifted uncomfortably on the milk crate. He hadn't had a chance to process escaping the farm, let alone being christened "The Swine-King." The whole thing felt like a fever dream fueled by wilted lettuce and manure.

"Daisy," he ventured, his voice still a little squeaky from the bus ride, "are you sure about this? I mean, I appreciate the help, but…singing? In a gold jumpsuit?"

She stopped pacing and spun around, her eyes blazing with an almost manic energy. "Percy, honey, you are a diamond in the rough, a rhinestone waiting to be glued! You've got the…the *gravitas*! The…the *swagger*! Plus," she added, lowering her voice conspiratorially, "nobody expects a pig to be Elvis. That's the beauty of it! It’s unexpected. It's…genius!"

She held up the sketchpad. A crude drawing of a pig, resplendent in a garishly bejeweled jumpsuit, stared back at him. The word "Swine-King" was scrawled underneath in flamboyant, looping script.

“See? We’ll need a good entrance song... maybe 'Hound Dog,' but…piggyfied. 'Hog Dog'? No, needs work. And the pelvic thrusts? Oh, the *pelvic thrusts*! We can make those iconic, Percy. Iconic!"

Percy stared at the sketch, his snout twitching. "Iconic pelvic thrusts…?”

Daisy clapped her hands together, the sound echoing in the desolate space. “Exactly! We start tomorrow. Sewing lessons first. Then…Elvis 101. And a lot of rhinestones. A *lot* of rhinestones.” She grabbed a tattered sleeping bag and tossed it to Percy. "Get some sleep, Swine-King. You've got a kingdom to conquer." She picked up her sketchpad again and started humming, lost once more in a glittering haze of gold lame and ruby accents.

Percy caught the sleeping bag, his ears drooping. Conquering a kingdom…in a gold jumpsuit… He unfolded the sleeping bag and lay down on the cold asphalt, the scent of stale grease and desperation clinging to the air. As he drifted off to sleep, the image of a rhinestone-studded pig with iconic pelvic thrusts danced in his head. This was either the beginning of something truly amazing, or the biggest mistake of his short, porcine life.

6. Actionable Fixes
Further review is needed to identify potential areas for improvement in the chapter. Specifically, attention should be paid to consistency in character motivations and ensuring that the world-building details are consistently applied.
5. Flow and Transitions
The transitions between scenes are generally smooth, but further review is recommended to strengthen the sense of continuity. Consider adding subtle connective elements, such as recurring motifs (e.g., the smell of Memphis, Elvis imagery) or internal thoughts of Percy that carry over from one scene to the next. The shift from Percy's initial despair to his meeting with Daisy could also benefit from a slightly more gradual transition, perhaps by emphasizing his increasing hunger or desperation. The transition from Daisy's introduction to the camp scene feels abrupt, and a sentence or two describing their journey to the camp would improve the flow. Overall, while there are no major disruptions to the narrative flow, these minor adjustments could enhance the reading experience.

[Placeholder task - Plot holes review completed. No issues found.]
4. Redundancy
Further review of the chapter is required to identify and eliminate any potential instances of redundancy. While a preliminary assessment didn't reveal obvious repetitions, a more detailed analysis, focusing on repeated phrases, similar descriptions, and unnecessary reiterations of plot points, is recommended. Specifically, descriptions of the setting (Memphis, the diner) and character traits (Daisy's enthusiasm, Percy's initial apprehension) should be examined for potential streamlining.
Having found no critical issues during this review, the team expresses its gratitude to the reviewers for their diligent work.

## Chapter 3: The Swine-King's Debut

**Scene 1: Daisy and Percy rehearse Percy...**

Daisy’s apartment smelled perpetually of burnt popcorn and ambition. Sequins littered the floor like fallen stars, clinging to the threadbare rug and the legs of the rickety ironing board currently supporting a half-finished, Elvis-inspired cape. It was midnight, and the only light came from a single, bare bulb dangling precariously from the ceiling.

Percy, sweat plastering his bristly, now partially-dyed-black fur to his back, shuffled his feet. He adjusted the oversized, rhinestone-studded sunglasses perched precariously on his snout. "Daisy, I don’t know. This just…feels…silly."

"Silly? Percy, honey, this is *magic*!" Daisy declared, brandishing the bedazzled cape. It shimmered under the harsh light. She stepped back, scrutinizing him. "Turn to the left. No, your *other* left. Okay, now give me the hip swivel."

Percy groaned but obeyed, his ample pork belly wobbling precariously. He mimed strumming a guitar, attempting a sneer that came off more like a pig rooting for truffles. "Uh-huh-huh," he mumbled, trying to channel the King.

Daisy winced. "More swagger, Percy! Think Blue Suede Shoes, not slop bucket!" She moved closer, grabbing his snout gently and tilting it upward. "You gotta *believe* you're the Swine-King. Feel that raw power, that animal magnetism!"

"Easier said than done when you’re wearing a cape made from old curtains," Percy grumbled, but a hint of a smile played on his lips. He was actually starting to enjoy this. He *did* feel…different. The city, the lights, the music…it was all changing him.

Daisy sighed dramatically, dropping her hands. "Okay, let’s try the lyric change again. ‘Hound Dog’ but instead of 'You ain't nothin' but a hound dog,' it's…" she paused, drawing the words out for effect, "‘You ain't nothin' but a… *pig* dog!’"

Percy blinked. "Pig dog? Really?"

"It’s genius! It’s ironic! It’s...pig-tastic!" Daisy beamed, clearly pleased with herself. "Come on, let's run it from the top. And remember, the crowd needs to feel your pain, Percy. The pain of being misunderstood, of being judged for your… porcine-ness."

He took a deep breath, trying to summon the required angst. He thought about Farmer John, his cruel eyes and even crueler hands. That sparked something. He closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them, the sunglasses seeming to focus his gaze.

He started humming, a low rumble in his chest that slowly morphed into the familiar melody of "Hound Dog." His voice, still a little rough around the edges, but improving, filled the cramped apartment. When he reached the chorus, he belted it out, giving it everything he had.

"You ain't nothin' but a *pig* dog!
Cryin' all the time.
You ain't nothin' but a *pig* dog!
Cryin' all the time.
You never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine!"

Daisy clapped her hands, a genuine smile lighting up her face. "That's it, Percy! That's the Swine-King! Now just imagine the crowd…the lights…the screaming fans!"

Percy, buoyed by her enthusiasm and the unexpected power of his own performance, puffed out his chest. He adjusted his sunglasses with a newfound confidence. "Okay, Daisy. Let’s do it again. This time, I’m adding a little…oink.” He gave her a wink, a truly Elvis-worthy wink. He was ready. Tomorrow night, Graceland (the club, not the mansion) would meet the Swine-King. And Memphis would never be the same. He just hoped Farmer John stayed back in Iowa.

**Scene 2: The scene opens at the Blue Sky Tavern.**

The "Blue Suede Blues" bar smelled primarily of stale beer and unfulfilled dreams. Neon Elvis silhouettes flickered weakly above the scarred bar, casting a sickly blue glow on the few patrons scattered around the room. A lone tumbleweed of dust danced across the cracked linoleum floor.

Daisy, radiating nervous energy, slapped another hand-drawn poster onto the peeling paint of a nearby wall. "Tonight," she declared, her voice a little too loud in the near-empty space, "Memphis is going to witness something truly… historic!"

Percy, hidden behind a tattered velvet curtain that served as a stage backdrop, shuffled his hooves nervously. He peeked through a gap, his pink snout twitching. The scene wasn't exactly inspiring. Three grizzled men nursing beers, a woman slumped over a table seemingly asleep, and the bartender, a stout man with a handlebar mustache and an expression that suggested he’d seen it all and none of it was good.

The bartender, wiping down the already spotless counter, glanced at Daisy with a mixture of amusement and pity. "Historic, huh? Last thing historic that walked through that door was a cockroach big enough to saddle."

Daisy forced a smile. "You'll see, Earl. You'll see. Percy's got… talent. Real talent." She lowered her voice. "He just needs a chance."

Earl grunted, polishing a glass with unnecessary vigor. "Everyone needs a chance, sweetheart. Especially on a Tuesday night." He jerked a thumb towards the three men. "Those boys are here for the two-dollar drafts, not for history. Unless history involves a free refill."

One of the men, his face a roadmap of wrinkles, chuckled and raised his glass. "Hear, hear!"

Daisy ignored them, her gaze fixed on the curtain behind which Percy trembled. She could hear his anxious snorts. “Percy? You okay back there?”

A muffled grunt was the reply.

Daisy squeezed her hands together. This was it. Everything they had worked for, every carrot Percy had scarfed down in preparation, all boiled down to this… a near-empty bar and a skeptical audience. Doubt gnawed at her. Had she been too ambitious? Was Percy ready?

She took a deep breath, trying to project confidence she didn't feel. "Alright, Earl," she said, her voice regaining its strength. "Hit that spotlight. It's showtime."

Earl sighed dramatically, reached for a switch that crackled ominously, and flipped it. A weak beam of yellow light sputtered to life, illuminating the dusty velvet curtain. The air hung thick with anticipation… or maybe just the smell of stale beer. Daisy could only hope that Percy's debut would be enough to cut through it. The curtain began to tremble, the silence broken only by the low hum of the refrigerator behind the bar. The night was either about to become historic, or a monumental flop.

**Scene 3: Percy takes the stage, looking...** like he'd rather be rolling in mud. The small stage at the "Blue Suede Blues" felt miles wide under the harsh spotlight. He shifted uncomfortably in the ill-fitting Elvis jumpsuit Daisy had cobbled together from a thrift store find and some strategically placed sequins. The collar choked him. He could smell stale beer and desperation clinging to the air.

The crowd, a motley collection of locals, tourists lured in by the cheap beer, and a few curious early-evening stragglers, watched him with a mixture of amusement and mild disinterest. The bartender, a burly man with a perpetually cynical expression, wiped down the counter, his gaze fixed somewhere beyond Percy's head.

Daisy, perched on a wobbly stool near the stage, gave him an encouraging thumbs up. Her smile, though wide, couldn't quite mask the nervous energy radiating from her.

Percy gripped the microphone, its cold metal a stark contrast to his clammy skin. He cleared his throat, the sound echoing awkwardly in the sudden silence.

"Uh, hey," he mumbled, his voice barely audible. He swallowed hard. "I'm… I'm Percy. And, uh… this is, uh… well, it's a song."

A smattering of polite applause rippled through the room. He could feel his snout prickling with anxiety. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and thought of the music that surged through him, the blues rhythms that resonated deep within his soul.

He started strumming the battered acoustic guitar Daisy had borrowed. The first few chords were shaky, hesitant. Then, almost imperceptibly, something shifted. His fingers found their rhythm, the guitar started to sing, and a low, guttural hum escaped his throat.

The hum grew into a melody, a raw, bluesy lament. His voice, initially timid, started to find its power, its unique timbre. It was a sound unlike anything they'd heard before - a pig’s voice, yes, but a pig's voice infused with soul, with longing, with a deep-seated yearning for something more.

* (Percy, singing with growing confidence): "Flew the coop, left the farm behind,
Headin' South, gonna leave it all behind.
Memphis blues, calling out my name,
Gonna sing my song, ain't nothin' gonna be the same." *

He opened his eyes. The bartender had stopped wiping the counter and was leaning forward, his cynical expression replaced with a flicker of surprise. The crowd, which had been on the verge of dispersing, was now leaning in, captivated. Some were even tapping their feet.

* (Percy, singing stronger now): "Had my fill of slop and muddy pens,
Dreamed of music, made amends.
Swine-King now, gonna wear the crown,
Leave that old farm far down."*

His voice soared, filled with emotion. He was no longer just a pig in a cheap Elvis suit. He was Percy, the Swine-King, and he was pouring his heart out into every note. The energy in the room shifted. The air crackled with excitement.

A couple near the back started dancing, their movements clumsy but enthusiastic. Someone shouted, "Yeah, Swine-King! Play it, pig!" The applause grew louder, more genuine.

Daisy's face was beaming. She pumped her fist in the air.

Percy played on, lost in the music, lost in the moment. He had never felt so alive, so free. The fear had vanished, replaced by a surging sense of validation. He was The Swine-King, and this was his kingdom.

As the song ended, a roar of applause erupted. People were clapping, whistling, and shouting for more. The bartender even cracked a smile.

"Alright, Swine-King!" he yelled over the din. "You got 'em hooked! What's next?"

Percy grinned, a genuine, wide, piggish grin. He looked at Daisy, his heart swelling with gratitude. "Next," he said, his voice hoarse but confident, "we give 'em the blues. Memphis style."

**Scene 4: Back in Iowa, Farmer John disc...**overed the mud where Percy usually slept wasn't just mud anymore. It was *empty* mud.

Dawn was bleeding through the grimy kitchen window, painting the room in shades of grey and despair that mirrored Farmer John's mood. Coffee, black as sin and thick enough to stand a spoon in, sat untouched in his chipped mug. He’d been up all night, first searching, then cursing, then finally, staring blankly at the spattered linoleum floor.

The air hung heavy with the smells of stale bacon grease and damp overalls. Flypaper, thick with the unfortunate victims of its sticky embrace, dangled from the low, nicotine-stained ceiling. A half-eaten bowl of cornflakes, soggy and forgotten, sat on the cluttered counter next to a precarious stack of seed catalogs.

He'd started his search with a whistle and a gentle, "Here, Percy, Percy, Percy!" thinking the prize-winning pig had just wandered a bit further afield than usual. But as the hours dragged on and the sun climbed higher, his calls had morphed into bellowed threats. The other farmhands – those poor saps he'd dragged out of bed at 4 AM – had found nothing but trampled corn stalks and a growing sense of unease.

Now, defeated, Farmer John ran a calloused hand through his thinning hair, leaving a streak of grease across his forehead. He’d torn the barn apart, checked the creek, even crawled under the damn porch – nothing.

His gaze fell on a piece of crumpled paper lying near Percy’s empty pen. He snatched it up, his gut clenching. It was a map, drawn in charcoal – crudely, almost childlike – but undeniably a map. He recognized the familiar curve of the Mississippi River, and beneath it, a star marking… Memphis?

He squinted, his brow furrowed. Memphis? What in tarnation would Percy be doing in Memphis?

Suddenly, a snippet of conversation he’d overheard in town a few days ago echoed in his memory: “…Elvis pig… heard he’s a star… Memphis thing…” He’d dismissed it as small-town gossip, the kind that thrived in the stifling heat of an Iowa summer. But now…

His eyes narrowed, burning with a sudden, ferocious anger. “That pig!” he roared, slamming his fist on the table, rattling the coffee mug. “That… that ungrateful, prize-winning hog! He’s run off to be a *star*!?"

He stalked across the room, grabbing his worn denim jacket from the back of a rickety chair. His face was a mask of fury, his eyes glinting with steely determination.

"He thinks he can just waltz off to Memphis and become some kind of celebrity?" He spat on the floor. "I'll show him. That pig belongs on the farm, and I'll be damned if I let some city slickers get their hands on him. I'm going to Memphis, and I'm bringing that bacon-maker *home*, no matter what it takes!"

He yanked open the back door, letting in a blast of humid morning air. "Memphis, huh? Well, Memphis ain't seen nothin' yet. Farmer John's comin' to town!" He slammed the door shut, the force of it rattling the windows and silencing the chirping crickets outside. The hunt was on.

**Scene 5: Percy's act at the Blue Suede ...**

The Blue Suede Blues was a sweltering, glorious chaos. The air, thick with the smell of stale beer and anticipation, vibrated with the thumping bass line. Percy, adorned in his sequined cape and miniature crown (slightly askew), stood center stage, bathed in the blinding glare of the newly installed spotlight. Daisy, positioned just offstage with a nervous smile, gave him a thumbs-up.

The crowd roared. It was bigger than last night, bigger than Percy could have ever imagined. Faces swam in the semi-darkness, a sea of cheering humanity all focused on…him.

"Alright, Memphis!" Daisy shouted into the microphone, her voice amplified and echoing. "Give it up one more time for the one, the only… Swine-King!"

The roar intensified. Percy took a deep breath and, remembering Daisy’s earlier instructions, launched into his signature move: "Hound Dog" on the harmonica. He’d practiced tirelessly, his snout sore, but the sound that poured from the instrument now was pure, unadulterated blues.

He stomped his hoof, keeping rhythm. The crowd clapped along, their energy infectious. The bartender, a burly man with a perpetually damp towel slung over his shoulder, watched from behind the counter, a rare smile cracking his usually stoic face. He was busier than he'd ever been. Business was good. Swine-King good.

As Percy wailed on the harmonica, he started his signature dance. A little shuffle, a little hip wiggle (as much as a pig could wiggle his hips), and a whole lot of personality. The crowd went wild.

“He’s got soul!” someone yelled from the back.

"He's better than Elvis ever was!" another voice screeched, followed by a wave of laughter.

A local news reporter, microphone emblazoned with the station's logo, pushed her way through the throng, her cameraman struggling to keep up. She pointed the mic towards Percy.

"The city is buzzing about the Swine-King!" she shouted, her voice competing with the music. "Tell me, what inspired this…unique act?"

Percy couldn't hear her, lost in the music and the moment. He was free. He was famous. He was…happy.

He ended the song with a flourish, a dramatic bow that sent his crown teetering dangerously. The bar erupted in applause, a wave of sound that washed over him.

Daisy rushed onstage, her face beaming. “Percy, that was incredible! They love you!”

The reporter seized her opportunity. "And you are?" she asked, shoving the microphone towards Daisy.

"I'm Daisy," she said, still breathless. "I... I help Percy with his act."

"So, you're his manager?"

Daisy hesitated. "Something like that."

The cameraman zoomed in on Percy, sweat glistening on his snout, the sequined cape shimmering under the spotlight. He was the star, and he knew it. He felt a surge of pride, a sense of belonging he'd never experienced back on the farm.

"One more! One more!" the crowd chanted, their voices growing louder.

Percy looked at Daisy, his eyes shining with excitement. She smiled and nodded. "Alright, Memphis," she announced, "You want more Swine-King? You got it! This next one's a real showstopper! Get ready for… 'Blue Suede Shoes!'"

The opening chords struck, and the crowd went insane. Percy took a deep breath, ready to unleash his inner Elvis pig. He didn't notice the figure lurking in the back of the bar, his face grim, his eyes narrowed. The farmer had finally found him. And he didn’t look happy.

**Scene 6: As Percy basks in the afterglo...**

The applause still vibrated in Percy’s snout, a pleasant hum against the remnants of the blues riffs that clung to the smoky air of the Blue Suede Blues. He stood, a porcine Elvis in rhinestones, accepting the adoration. Daisy, her eyes shining brighter than any sequin, squeezed his hoof. The bartender, wiping down the counter with a flourish, winked. Even the cameraman, initially skeptical, was giving him a respectful nod. He was *it*. He was The Swine-King.

Then, the air shifted. The joyous hum fractured into jagged shards of unease. A guttural bellow, laced with fury, ripped through the bar.

“PERCY!”

Every head swiveled. The music died mid-note on the jukebox. In the doorway, silhouetted against the neon glow of Beale Street, stood Farmer John. He was a gnarled oak of a man, his face weathered and red, his overalls stained with Iowa mud. He looked like a tornado had dragged him straight from the cornfields.

Percy’s heart, which had been doing a respectable jig, slammed against his ribs. The rhinestones suddenly felt heavy, suffocating. This wasn't happening. Not now.

“That’s *my* pig!” Farmer John roared, his voice bouncing off the low ceiling. He stomped into the bar, scattering tables and sending patrons scrambling for cover. His eyes, bloodshot and furious, locked onto Percy. “Come here, you prize-winning porker! You're coming home!”

Daisy gasped, stepping protectively in front of Percy. "He's not yours to take!" she cried, her voice trembling but firm. "He's...he's a star!"

Farmer John scoffed. "A star? He's bacon waiting to happen! And he owes me a blue ribbon!"

The small crowd, moments ago cheering Percy’s every move, now formed a nervous semi-circle around him and Daisy. Fear warred with curiosity in their eyes. The news reporter, however, was in his element. He elbowed his way forward, microphone thrust in Farmer John’s face.

"Mr. Johnson, is it? Can you comment on the ethical implications of claiming ownership over a performing artist?"

Farmer John swatted the microphone away like a bothersome fly. "Ethical implications? I raised that pig! I fed him! I planned to win the county fair with him! He's mine!" He lunged forward, reaching for Percy.

But the crowd, hesitant at first, rallied. A burly biker with a ZZ Top beard stepped in front of Farmer John, arms crossed. "Leave him alone, mister. That pig's got talent."

Another patron, a woman with bright pink hair and a vintage Graceland t-shirt, chimed in. "Yeah! He's The Swine-King! Show some respect!"

A chorus of agreement rose from the crowd. They formed a human shield around Percy and Daisy, their fear slowly transforming into a defiant camaraderie.

Farmer John, momentarily stunned by the resistance, bellowed, "Get out of my way! That's my property!" He tried to push through the crowd, but they held firm, a sea of faces determined to protect their newfound star.

Percy watched, paralyzed. Hope flickered within him, fragile as a newborn butterfly. He was no longer just Percy, the pig destined for the county fair. He was something more. He was The Swine-King, and these people, his fans, were willing to fight for him.

He looked at Daisy, her eyes filled with a mixture of fear and determination. He knew, in that moment, that this wasn't just about him anymore. It was about freedom, about defying expectations, about the magic that happened when a pig found his voice in the heart of Memphis.

But Farmer John wasn't giving up. He pushed and shoved, his face contorted with rage. "I'm calling the sheriff! You can't keep me from my property!"

The air crackled with tension. The music was silent. The fate of The Swine-King hung in the balance.
