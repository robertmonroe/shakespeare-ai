    "description": "Sixteen-year-old Maya Chen has spent every summer since her parents' divorce volunteering at Riverside Zoo, where she's more fluent in animal behavior than small talk. Her closest companion is Chester, a rescued chimpanzee with an extraordinary quirk—he's obsessed with an old Elvis documentary that plays on loop in the primate house, and has taught himself to mirror the King's signature dance moves with uncanny precision. When budget cuts force the zoo to reduce overnight security, Chester slips out through a faulty enclosure lock and wanders into downtown Riverside. A college student filming at a street festival captures Chester's impromptu performance—gyrating hips, lip curls, and all—and the video explodes online, racking up millions of views within hours. As Maya frantically searches for Chester, she discovers he's taken refuge at Meadowbrook Nursing Home, where her estranged grandmother Rose lives. Rose, a former backup singer who toured in the 1960s, has been secretly encouraging Chester's visits, teaching him new moves and finding renewed purpose in their unlikely rehearsals. But Chester's fame has attracted attention from Marcus Webb, a slick talent agent who sees dollar signs, and Dr. Patricia Okonkwo, the zoo's new director who wants Chester returned immediately to avoid liability. Maya finds herself caught between three impossible options: return Chester to his lonely enclosure, allow him to be paraded as a performing novelty, or fight for placement in a primate sanctuary—a process that could take months he doesn't have. As she reconnects with her grandmother and learns about Rose's own complicated history with the entertainment industry, Maya realizes that both she and Chester have been hiding from the world rather than living in it. With the help of an ambitious young journalist who wants to expose the ethics of viral animal fame, Maya must find her voice and advocate for what Chester truly needs—not captivity, not stardom, but a community where he's valued as an individual, not a spectacle. This contemporary young adult novel explores the cost of fame, the complexity of freedom, and the courage it takes to choose authentic connection over comfortable isolation.",
