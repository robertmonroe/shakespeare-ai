## Chapter 3: Building the Legend

**Scene 1: Max arrives at CIA headquarter...**

# Scene 1: Max arrives at CIA headquarters in Langley and meets with the identity division specialists

The fluorescent lights of the Identity Division hummed with a frequency that set Max's teeth on edge. He'd been in the bowels of Langley before, but never in this particular corner of the sprawling complex—a windowless warren of offices where people were unmade and remade with the stroke of a keyboard.

Sarah Chen looked up from her triple-monitor setup as Max entered the briefing room. She was younger than he'd expected, maybe thirty, with sharp eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses and fingers that moved across her keyboard like a concert pianist's.

"Agent Monroe." She didn't offer her hand. "Please, sit. We have a lot to cover."

Max settled into the chair across from her desk, noting the biometric scanner embedded in the armrest, the white noise generator humming in the corner, the absence of any personal effects that might hint at who Sarah Chen was when she left this room. A woman who built lies for a living had learned not to leave truths lying around.

"Maxwell Reed," Sarah said, sliding a tablet across the desk. "That's you now. Or will be, once we're done."

Max picked up the device. A photograph stared back at him—his own face, but somehow different. The same sharp jaw and dark eyes, but the expression was softer, more open. The smile reached his eyes in a way his real smile never quite managed anymore.

"We've aged you down slightly," Sarah explained. "Softened some of the harder edges. You look like someone who's spent the last decade in boardrooms, not war zones." She tapped her screen, and Max's tablet updated. "Stanford MBA, class of 2012. You specialized in emerging technologies and venture capital. Your thesis on blockchain applications in supply chain management was cited seventeen times—all by real academics, by the way. We had to actually write it."

Max scrolled through the document. The attention to detail was staggering. "Someone at the Agency wrote a Stanford MBA thesis for my cover?"

"Dr. Reeves in Technical Services. He has three PhDs." Sarah's expression didn't change. "He complained the entire time that it wasn't rigorous enough for his standards, but we needed it to be good, not perfect. Perfect attracts attention."

The door opened, and James Carver entered carrying two coffee cups. He set one in front of Max—black, no sugar, exactly how he took it—and leaned against the wall.

"Sarah's being modest," Carver said. "Her legends have survived scrutiny from FSB, MSS, and Mossad. Maxwell Reed will hold up to anything Silicon Valley throws at you."

Sarah pulled up another screen. "Your first startup was a mobile app for restaurant reservations—sold to OpenTable in 2015 for eight million. Not spectacular, but enough to establish credibility. Your second was more impressive: an AI-driven analytics platform for retail inventory management. Exit in 2018 to Oracle for sixty-five million."

"And now I'm independently wealthy, looking for the next big thing," Max said.

"Exactly. Current portfolio value is approximately two hundred million, diversified across thirty-seven investments." Sarah's fingers flew across her keyboard. "You've got stakes in three unicorns, a dozen promising Series A and B companies, and enough smaller bets to show you're not risk-averse. You favor AI, blockchain, and biotech. You're known for being hands-on with your portfolio companies—attending conferences, making introductions, opening doors."

Max studied the investment portfolio. Each company was real, each stake carefully constructed through a web of shell corporations and nominee shareholders. "How deep does this go?"

"Deep enough." Sarah pulled up a new document. "You have a verified Wikipedia page—not too detailed, but present. LinkedIn with four hundred and thirty-two connections, all real people in the tech industry. Some of them will even remember meeting you at conferences."

"How?"

"We have assets in place. People who attend these events regularly and can casually mention having met you, shared a panel with you, had drinks after a keynote." Sarah's expression remained professionally neutral, but Max caught a hint of pride. "Your social media presence goes back six years. We've backdated everything—tweets about funding rounds, Instagram posts from Burning Man, a Medium blog where you occasionally pontificate about the future of technology."

She slid a physical folder across the desk. Inside were photographs: Max at a tech conference in Austin, Max shaking hands with a founder at a pitch event, Max in casual conversation at what looked like a rooftop party in San Francisco.

"These are all composites," Max said, recognizing the subtle tells of digital manipulation.

"Very good composites," Carver interjected. "The best in the world. They'll pass any verification short of forensic analysis, and even then, they'd need to know what they're looking for."

Sarah opened another file. "Your apartment is in Pacific Heights. We've had it staged for three months—books on the shelves, wine in the cellar, even your browsing history on the laptop shows appropriate research patterns. Your gym membership has been active for two years. Your dry cleaner knows you by name."

Max felt the weight of Maxwell Reed settling onto his shoulders like an expensive suit. "What about personal relationships?"

"You were engaged once, five years ago. She broke it off—said you were married to your work. Her name was Jennifer Lawson, and she's now happily married to a dermatologist in Portland. If anyone asks, you're still friendly but don't keep in touch." Sarah paused. "You date casually but nothing serious. You're focused on building your portfolio, making an impact. The usual tech bro excuse for emotional unavailability."

"Charming," Max said dryly.

"It's believable," Sarah countered. "That's what matters."

Carver pushed off from the wall and moved to stand behind Sarah, looking at her screens. "The legend is solid, Max. But a legend is just paperwork and digital footprints. You need to become Maxwell Reed. Think like him, talk like him, react like him."

"That's why we're starting with the briefings," Sarah said. "You need to be able to discuss cryptocurrency mining operations, debate the merits of different AI architectures, have opinions on which VCs are smart money and which are just following trends. You need to know who's sleeping with whom, which founders have substance abuse problems, which companies are cooking their books."

She pulled up a new screen filled with faces and names. "These are the players you'll need to know. The top tier of Silicon Valley. Founders, investors, influencers. Some of them might be targets. Some of them might be witnesses. All of them will be evaluating you, deciding if you're worth their time."

Max studied the faces. Young, mostly. Confident. The kind of people who believed they were changing the world and couldn't understand why everyone else didn't see their vision.

"How long do I have to learn all this?" he asked.

"Seventy-two hours," Carver said. "Then you're wheels up to Barcelona."

Max felt something tighten in his chest—not quite anxiety, but its professional cousin. The kind of tension that came before every deep cover operation, the moment when you stepped off solid ground and hoped the legend would hold.

Sarah must have caught something in his expression. Her voice softened, just slightly. "You'll be fine, Agent Monroe. I've built covers for people with far less natural aptitude. You're a chameleon—your file shows that. You just need the right skin to wear."

"Maxwell Reed," Max said, testing the name in his mouth. It tasted like expensive scotch and barely concealed ambition.

"Maxwell Reed," Sarah confirmed. She stood, extending her hand this time. "Welcome to Silicon Valley, Mr. Reed. Try not to get yourself killed."

Her grip was firm, professional, but Max noticed the slight tremor in her fingers as she released his hand. Even the people who built legends knew how fragile they could be.

Carver gestured toward the door. "Come on. We've got six more divisions to visit before end of day. Crypto briefing is in twenty minutes, and those guys get cranky if you're late."

Max stood, taking one last look at the screens showing Maxwell Reed's fabricated life. Somewhere in that digital construction was a trap door that would lead him to a killer. He just had to find it without falling through himself.

As they walked down the corridor, past doors marked with security clearances and cryptic department codes, Max felt the familiar sensation of transformation beginning. Max Monroe was being carefully packed away, stored in some mental compartment where he could be retrieved later. If there was a later.

Maxwell Reed was stepping forward, adjusting his imaginary cufflinks, preparing to enter a world where innovation and murder shared the same champagne receptions.

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead,

**Scene 2: Max undergoes intensive crash ...**

**Scene 2: Max undergoes intensive crash courses with various experts**

The fluorescent lights in Briefing Room 7 had been humming for three hours straight, a monotonous drone that matched the throb building behind Max's eyes. Dr. Richard Huang stood before a wall-sized screen displaying what looked like a digital spider web—nodes and connections sprawling in every direction, each labeled with cryptographic terminology that might as well have been ancient Sanskrit.

"The blockchain is fundamentally a distributed ledger," Huang said for what felt like the tenth time, his pointer dancing across the illuminated diagram. "Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp, and transaction data. You need to understand this, Mr. Monroe. Maxwell Reed would understand this."

Max rubbed his temples. "I've infiltrated terror cells in Kandahar. I've run operations in Moscow where one wrong word meant a bullet. But this..." He gestured at the screen. "This is a different kind of warfare."

"Welcome to the twenty-first century." Huang's smile held no warmth. Mid-forties, MIT credentials that covered an entire wall of his office, and the social skills of a particularly irritable hedgehog. The Agency had pulled him from somewhere in the private sector, though Max suspected "pulled" was too gentle a word. "Your targets don't speak in bullets and bombs anymore. They speak in tokens and gas fees, in proof-of-stake versus proof-of-work. If you can't engage on their level, you're not just blown—you're irrelevant. And irrelevant people don't get invited to private events."

Max stood, pacing the length of the room. The walls were covered with printouts—market charts, technical whitepapers, screenshots of Discord channels where fortunes were made and lost in cryptic exchanges. His reflection caught in the darkened window: a man who'd spent fifteen years perfecting the art of violence now drowning in PowerPoint presentations.

"Again," he said, turning back. "From the top. But this time, explain it like you would to someone at a cocktail party, not a computer science lecture."

Huang's expression shifted—surprise, then something approaching respect. "Smart. That's actually how they talk. The real players simplify because they're secure in their knowledge. It's the wannabes who drown you in jargon." He cleared the screen, pulled up a new slide. "Okay. Imagine a notebook that everyone can read, but nobody can erase..."

The next four hours blurred together. Huang walked him through DeFi protocols, NFT markets, and the cult of personality surrounding various blockchain platforms. Max took notes in a leather journal, his handwriting growing increasingly cramped as concepts piled atop concepts. Smart contracts. Decentralized autonomous organizations. Layer-two solutions.

By the time they broke for lunch—a sad sandwich delivered by a wordless aide—Max's head felt stuffed with cotton and circuitry.

He had twenty minutes. He spent them in the hallway, walking off the mental fatigue, when Amanda Torres found him.

"Surviving?" She carried a tablet and a coffee that smelled like actual coffee, not the motor oil from the break room. Mid-thirties, sharp features, sharper eyes. The Agency's behavioral specialist had the unnerving ability to read people like headlines.

"Barely." Max accepted the coffee she offered. "Please tell me your session is less technical."

"Different kind of technical." Torres gestured toward another briefing room. "I'm here to teach you how to be rich."

The new room was smaller, more intimate. Instead of screens and diagrams, the walls displayed photographs—candid shots from tech conferences, charity galas, private yacht parties. Beautiful people in expensive clothes, drinks in hand, the casual confidence of those who'd never worried about money.

"Being wealthy isn't about knowing your net worth," Torres began, settling into a chair and motioning for Max to do the same. "It's about behavior, assumptions, the thousand tiny signals that separate old money from new, real players from pretenders." She swiped her tablet, and a video began playing—a tall man in his fifties, silver hair, tailored suit, holding court at what looked like a rooftop bar.

"Thomas Caldwell. Venture capitalist, early investor in three unicorns, net worth north of two billion. Watch how he moves."

Max watched. Caldwell's gestures were economical, precise. He never raised his voice, yet people leaned in to hear him. When he laughed, it was genuine but controlled. His attention was a gift he bestowed selectively.

"Notice what he doesn't do," Torres said. "Doesn't check his phone. Doesn't name-drop. Doesn't talk about money directly. The truly wealthy never do—it's gauche. They talk about 'projects' and 'opportunities' and 'interesting spaces.' They let others bring up valuations."

She pulled up another video—a woman this time, younger, tech hoodie under a designer blazer. "Sarah Chen. Self-made, sold her first startup at twenty-eight for four hundred million. Different energy entirely. She's proving something. Watch the eye contact, the interruptions, the way she establishes dominance in conversations."

For the next three hours, Torres walked Max through a rogues' gallery of Silicon Valley personalities. He learned that venture capitalists fell into distinct tribes—the engineer-turned-investors who still coded for fun, the finance bros who treated startups like poker chips, the philosopher-kings who spoke in TED talk platitudes about changing the world.

"Maxwell Reed," Torres said, pulling up the fabricated dossier the identity division had created, "is a hybrid. Engineering degree from Stanford, but you pivoted to finance early. Made your first real money in the 2010s, got out before the correction. You're smart enough to talk technology, experienced enough to spot bullshit, wealthy enough that you invest for sport as much as profit."

Max studied his own fake history. It was thorough—college transcripts, investment records, even social media accounts backdated years with carefully curated posts. Photos of him at conferences he'd never attended, photoshopped with surgical precision. A life constructed from pixels and paperwork.

"The key," Torres continued, "is that Reed is confident but not arrogant. Curious but not naive. You're wealthy enough to be in the room, but not so wealthy that you're untouchable. You're approachable. That's crucial."

"Because our killer approaches people."

"Exactly." Torres's expression darkened. "She—or he, we're not certain—targets people who are successful but still accessible. Not the Elon Musks of the world with security details. People who still attend the right parties, take meetings with interesting strangers, believe in the myth of serendipitous connections."

She pulled up crime scene photos. Max had seen them before, but Torres added context—social media posts from hours before each death, showing the victims at networking events, cocktail receptions, the casual mingling of the tech elite.

"David Park posted this selfie four hours before he died." A smiling Asian man, drink in hand, caption reading "Great conversations tonight #innovation #futuretech." "He was at a private event in Palo Alto. Invitation only. Two hundred guests, all vetted. Somewhere in that crowd was his killer."

Max leaned closer, studying the background of the photo. Faces blurred by distance and champagne, any one of them potentially lethal.

"Jennifer Morrison, same pattern." Another photo, another beautiful corpse-to-be smiling for the camera. "She posted from a rooftop bar in Austin during SXSW. Dead by morning."

"And Klaus Reinhardt?"

"No social media—he was old school that way. But security footage puts him at a blockchain conference in Zurich the night before. He was last seen leaving with an unidentified companion."

Torres swiped through more images, building a picture of the hunting ground. "These events are designed for connection. That's their purpose. People expect to meet strangers, to have interesting conversations with potential partners or investors. Our killer weaponizes that openness."

Max sat back, processing. "So I need to be interesting enough to be approached, but alert enough to spot the approach."

"While maintaining your cover, gathering intelligence, and not ending up dead." Torres's smile was grim. "Simple."

The afternoon session shifted to role-playing. Torres threw scenarios at him rapid-fire—cocktail party small talk, impromptu pitch sessions, the delicate dance of networking without seeming desperate. Max stumbled through conversations about market corrections and emerging technologies, his tongue tripping over terminology that still felt foreign.

"No, no, no." Torres stopped him mid-sentence. "You said 'cryptocurrency' like you're reading from a script. These people live this stuff. It's just 'crypto.' And nobody calls it 'blockchain technology

**Scene 3: Carver summons Max to a privat...**

**Scene 3: Carver summons Max to a private meeting**

The summons came through encrypted channels at 2147 hours—not a request, but a directive. Max had been reviewing surveillance footage from the San Francisco crime scene when his secure phone vibrated twice, displaying only a room number and a time: SC-7. Twenty minutes.

He found the door at the end of a corridor he'd never accessed before, past checkpoints that verified his retinal scan and thumbprint. SC-7 sat in the building's core, a windowless vault wrapped in signal-dampening copper mesh and reinforced concrete. The kind of room where conversations died the moment they were spoken.

James Carver waited inside, standing rather than sitting, his back to a wall covered in dark acoustic panels. The lighting came from recessed LEDs that cast no shadows, creating an unsettling flatness to the space. A single table occupied the center, its surface empty except for a manila folder and two bottles of water still sealed.

"Close it," Carver said.

The door's magnetic lock engaged with a solid thunk that Max felt in his chest. The air tasted recycled, sterile.

"Something wrong with your regular office?" Max asked, remaining near the door.

Carver's jaw tightened—a microexpression that lasted maybe half a second before his handler's mask slid back into place. "This conversation requires discretion beyond the usual protocols."

Max had known Carver for six years, worked under him on four continents, trusted him with his life in Mogadishu when an arms deal went sideways. He knew the man's tells: the way Carver's left hand would drift to his wedding ring when contemplating risk, how his breathing would slow before delivering bad news, the slight elevation of his chin when he was absolutely certain of his ground.

Right now, Carver's hand hovered near his pocket, fingers twitching. His breathing was shallow. His gaze kept sliding away from direct eye contact.

"We've identified the next likely strike," Carver said, moving to the table and flipping open the folder. Satellite imagery spilled across the surface—an aerial view of Barcelona's waterfront, the distinctive W Hotel rising like a sail against the Mediterranean. Red circles marked several buildings. "Tech Summit Barcelona. Starts in nine days. Three thousand attendees, but we've narrowed the high-value targets to seventeen individuals."

Max stepped closer, studying the photos. Faces he recognized from the briefings: CEOs, venture capitalists, a Saudi prince with a quantum computing portfolio, a Chinese-American entrepreneur whose facial recognition software had made him a billionaire by thirty.

"Intel basis?" Max asked.

"Pattern analysis. All three previous victims attended exclusive tech conferences in the thirty days before their deaths. Barcelona fits the profile—invitation-only sessions, private yacht parties, the kind of access our unsub craves." Carver's finger traced a route between marked buildings. "Your legend gets you into the main conference and two of the private events. We're still working on the yacht party."

Max picked up one of the photos—a woman in her forties with silver hair and sharp eyes. Dr. Sarah Chen, according to the caption. Founder of a cybersecurity firm that had gone public last year.

"She's target priority one," Carver said. "Former NSA, now private sector. Made enemies in Beijing when her company exposed a state-sponsored hacking operation."

"And the others?"

"Varying degrees of risk. But Chen checks all the boxes." Carver paused, and that hand drifted toward his pocket again. "There's something else you need to know. Context that didn't make it into the initial briefing."

The room's recycled air suddenly felt thinner. Max set down the photo and waited.

"Two of the three victims—Hartman and Kozlov—they were providing intelligence to us. Informally. Technology transfer monitoring, foreign investment tracking, that sort of thing." Carver's voice maintained its professional cadence, but sweat had appeared at his hairline despite the room's cool temperature. "Nothing operational. Just... eyes and ears in circles we don't normally penetrate."

Max felt something cold settle in his gut. "And we're just mentioning this now?"

"It's coincidental. The third victim, Nakamura, had no connection to the Agency. This isn't about burning our sources—it's about a killer with a type. Wealthy, powerful, accessible at the right venues." Carver met his eyes finally, and Max saw something there he couldn't quite name. Desperation? Fear? "But you needed to know before going in. In case... in case it becomes relevant."

"In case someone asks if I'm CIA?"

"In case you need to understand the full landscape." Carver's hand was in his pocket now, whatever he was gripping there making his knuckles white through the fabric. "This operation has oversight at the highest levels, Max. Director's eyes only. The kind of attention that means no mistakes, no surprises."

Max studied his handler's face, cataloging the deviations from baseline. The perspiration. The fidgeting. The way Carver's breathing had shifted from shallow to controlled, like he was manually regulating each breath.

"What aren't you telling me?"

"I've told you everything relevant to the mission." The response came too fast, too rehearsed.

"James—"

"You have nine days to prepare." Carver closed the folder with a sharp snap. "Barcelona station will provide local support, but you're running solo on the ground. Maxwell Reed doesn't have handlers, doesn't have backup. You're a venture capitalist with money to burn and connections to cultivate. That's the only reality that exists once you board that plane."

Max wanted to push, to demand the truth behind whatever was making his handler sweat in a climate-controlled vault. But six years of working together had also taught him when Carver had sealed a door that wouldn't open without explosives.

"Understood," Max said.

Carver pulled a USB drive from his pocket—that's what his hand had been gripping—and set it on the table. "Everything you need is here. Memorize it. Destroy it. And Max?" He paused at the door, his hand on the biometric scanner. "Watch yourself in Barcelona. Not just the mission. Watch yourself."

The magnetic lock disengaged. Carver disappeared into the corridor, leaving Max alone in the soundproof room with a folder full of potential victims and a USB drive full of lies he'd need to make truth.

He picked up Dr. Chen's photo again, studying the intelligence in those eyes. Two CIA informants dead. A third victim who supposedly had no connection. A handler who couldn't maintain eye contact. And somewhere in Barcelona's glittering tech ecosystem, a killer who murdered with intimacy and vanished like smoke.

Max pocketed the USB drive and headed for the door, but something made him pause. He turned back to look at the empty room, at the acoustic panels designed to swallow secrets, at the table where Carver had stood with his hand in his pocket, gripping a piece of plastic like a talisman.

*Watch yourself*, Carver had said. Not *watch your back* or *stay alert*—the standard handler farewell. *Watch yourself.*

As if the threat might come from somewhere closer than an unknown assassin.

As if it might come from within.

The magnetic lock engaged behind him with that same solid thunk, sealing the room and whatever truth it had contained. Max walked back through the checkpoints, past the retinal scanners and thumbprint readers, carrying questions that had no business existing nine days before an operation.

But they existed anyway, multiplying in the dark spaces between what he'd been told and what he'd observed. And in his experience, those dark spaces were where people died.

He had nine days to become Maxwell Reed.

He had less time than that to figure out what James Carver was really afraid of.

**Scene 4: Max reviews classified files o...**

**Scene 4: Max reviews classified files on the Barcelona summit attendees**

The secure reading room existed in a state of deliberate sensory deprivation. No windows. No ambient noise beyond the whisper of filtered air through ceiling vents. The walls were painted an institutional beige that seemed designed to erase personality, to reduce the world to nothing but the documents spread before you.

Max sat alone at the steel table, the only furniture in the twelve-by-twelve space. A single LED panel overhead cast shadowless light across the manila folders arranged in precise rows. Each bore a red diagonal stripe and a classification marking: TOP SECRET//NOFORN.

He'd been at it for three hours.

The security protocol was rigid. No phones. No recording devices. No notes leaving the room. A camera in the corner tracked his every movement, and the door could only be opened from the outside. The young analyst who'd escorted him in had explained the rules with the rehearsed precision of someone who'd delivered the speech a thousand times: "You have four hours. When time expires, all materials must be returned to their folders in the order you received them. Knock when you're finished."

Max flexed his fingers and reached for the next file.

**BARCELONA TECH SUMMIT - CONFIRMED ATTENDEES**

The summit was invitation-only, a gathering of tech's elite under the guise of discussing "ethical innovation and global digital infrastructure." The kind of event where billion-dollar deals happened over tapas and champagne, where the future was negotiated in hushed conversations on Mediterranean terraces.

He'd already memorized the basics: two hundred attendees, mostly CEOs, venture capitalists, and government technology advisors. The summit would span three days at a luxury hotel in the Gothic Quarter, with panels, networking sessions, and private dinners.

But it was the individual profiles that made his chest tighten.

**ATTENDEE 47: DMITRI VOLKOV**

CEO, Nexus Analytics. Specialization: predictive algorithms and data aggregation. Born Moscow, 1979. Emigrated to US, 2003. Currently resides London.

Max studied the surveillance photo clipped to the file. Volkov was thin, almost gaunt, with wire-rimmed glasses and the pallor of someone who spent too much time indoors. Unremarkable, except for one detail buried three pages in:

*Known associate of Mikhail Vershinsky (see file RUS-OLG-0847). Multiple documented meetings, 2019-2023. Nature of relationship: REDACTED.*

Max's pulse quickened. He flipped to the next file.

**ATTENDEE 63: SARAH CHEN**

Founder, Sentinel Systems. Former NSA contractor. Specialization: facial recognition and biometric surveillance.

Again, three pages in:

*Technology sales to Polish security services, 2021. Subsequent transfer to REDACTED. Investigation opened by Commerce Department, case closed without prosecution. Reasoning: REDACTED.*

The pattern emerged like a photograph in developing fluid—gradual, then undeniable.

Max worked faster now, pulling files, cross-referencing, building a mental map. His training kicked in, the analyst's brain that had made him valuable to the Agency before he'd ever fired a weapon in the field.

**ATTENDEE 89: THOMAS BRIGHTWELL**

British. Venture capital. Portfolio heavy in Eastern European tech startups.

*Multiple investments alongside Vershinsky Capital Partners. Joint holdings in: REDACTED, REDACTED, REDACTED.*

**ATTENDEE 112: NATASHA ORLOVA**

Russian-American dual citizen. Angel investor. Former physicist.

*FBI counterintelligence inquiry, 2020. Suspected of facilitating technology transfers to SVR-connected entities. Insufficient evidence for prosecution. Case officer notes: REDACTED.*

The air in the room felt thinner. Max loosened his tie, aware of the camera watching, forcing himself to maintain the appearance of routine review.

He opened the file on the summit's keynote speaker.

**DR. ELENA VASQUEZ**

Argentinian. AI ethics researcher. Author of three books on algorithmic bias and digital rights.

This one seemed clean. Academic background, progressive politics, no obvious connections to—

Wait.

Page seven. A footnote, almost dismissive:

*Vasquez received grant funding from the Meridian Foundation (2022-2024). Foundation board includes: REDACTED. See cross-reference: RUS-OLG-0847.*

Vershinsky again. The oligarch's name kept appearing, always redacted, always lurking behind shell companies and intermediaries.

Max sat back, the chair creaking in the silence. The three victims flashed through his mind: Anderson, Petrov, Nakamura. All connected to surveillance technology. All with ties, however tenuous, to Eastern Europe. And according to Carver, two had been CIA informants.

He reached for the supplementary intelligence file, marked with an additional caveat: **EYES ONLY - SPECIAL ACCESS REQUIRED**.

Inside, a single document. A cable from the CIA's Technology Crimes Division, dated six months ago:

*SUBJECT: Unauthorized Technology Proliferation Network*

*Analysis suggests coordinated effort to acquire Western surveillance and AI capabilities for transfer to hostile state actors. Primary vector appears to be legitimate business relationships with tech sector figures. Key facilitator believed to be REDACTED (Vershinsky). Network has penetrated: REDACTED.*

*Counterintelligence operations ongoing. REDACTED informants in place. Extreme sensitivity due to REDACTED.*

The rest was a sea of black bars.

Max's hands had gone cold. The pieces were connecting, but the picture they formed was incomplete, deliberately obscured. Someone had scrubbed these files, left just enough to brief him without revealing the full scope.

He thought of Carver's nervous energy during their last meeting. The way his handler had avoided eye contact when mentioning the victims' CIA connections. *Coincidental*, he'd said.

Nothing in this business was coincidental.

Max pulled the attendee list again, this time looking for what wasn't there. He counted: two hundred names. But the file numbers weren't sequential. Gaps appeared in the numbering—attendee 23, 44, 67, 91, 118, 156.

Six missing files.

He checked the manifest. The missing numbers corresponded to attendees, but their folders weren't in his stack. Someone had pulled them before he'd entered the room.

The LED panel hummed above him, a mosquito whine at the edge of hearing. Max stared at the files spread across the table, at the redactions and omissions, at the careful architecture of partial truth.

This wasn't just about a serial killer targeting tech executives. This was about something bigger, a web of intelligence operations and technology theft, of informants and oligarchs and secrets worth killing for.

And he was being sent into the center of it with a fabricated identity and a smile.

Max began methodically returning the files to their folders, his movements mechanical while his mind raced. The Barcelona summit was in seventy-two hours. Somewhere in that crowd of innovators and investors, a killer would be hunting. Maybe for revenge. Maybe for money. Maybe for reasons he couldn't yet fathom.

But the real question—the one that made his jaw tighten as he stacked the last folder—was whether the Agency was sending him to catch the killer or to become the next victim.

He knocked on the door.

The lock disengaged with a metallic click that sounded, in the sterile silence, like a bullet chambering.

**Scene 5: In the identity division's war...**

**Scene 5: In the identity division's wardrobe and props department**

The basement level of Langley smelled like expensive leather and fresh money.

Max stood on a raised platform in the center of what looked like a high-end boutique that had been transplanted underground. Racks of suits lined the walls—Italian, British, French—organized by occasion and season. Glass cases displayed watches that cost more than most people's cars. The fluorescent lighting had been replaced with warm spots that made everything glow with the soft patina of wealth.

"Arms out," Sarah Chen said, circling him with a tailor's measuring tape. She'd traded her analyst blazer for a sleek black turtleneck that made her look more like a gallery curator than a CIA officer.

Max complied, feeling the tape snake around his chest, his waist, his inseam. Behind Sarah, a thin man with silver hair and rimless glasses examined a rack of suits with the intensity of a surgeon selecting instruments.

"Marcus Webb," the man said without looking up. "I'll be your lifestyle consultant for this operation. I spent fifteen years working venture capital in Palo Alto before the Agency recruited me." He pulled a charcoal suit from the rack, held it up to the light, frowned, and returned it. "I know these people, Mr. Monroe. I know how they think, how they spend, how they signal status to each other. And I know when someone doesn't belong."

"Comforting," Max said.

Marcus finally looked at him, his pale blue eyes taking in every detail. "You have good bone structure. Athletic but not military-obvious. That helps." He selected another suit—midnight blue with a subtle pinstripe. "But you carry yourself wrong. Too alert. Too aware of exits and sight lines. Venture capitalists are predators, yes, but they hunt balance sheets, not humans."

Sarah finished measuring and stepped back. "Forty-two long. Thirty-two waist. I'll have the alterations team standing by."

"We'll start with the foundation," Marcus said, gesturing to a nearby table covered with leather goods. "Everything you carry tells a story. Maxwell Reed's story begins here."

He lifted a slim wallet—cognac-colored leather so soft it seemed to breathe. "Valextra. Milanese. Nothing ostentatious, but anyone who knows will recognize quality. Inside, you'll carry cards for accounts we've established over the past six months. Credit history, investment records, all backdated and verified."

Max took the wallet, felt its weight. Lighter than his own, which carried the accumulated debris of a real life—receipts, a photo of his sister from five years ago, a fortune cookie slip that read "Your past does not define your future."

"Watch," Marcus continued, lifting a piece from the glass case. "IWC Portuguese Chronograph. Forty-one millimeter. Rose gold. Understated enough to show you have taste, expensive enough to show you have means. Vintage Rolex would be trying too hard. Patek Philippe would be old money, which you're not."

The watch was heavy on Max's wrist. Through the exhibition caseback, he could see the mechanical movement—tiny gears and springs ticking away in perfect synchronization. A miniature machine doing what it was built to do.

Sarah returned with the midnight blue suit on a hanger. "Try this."

Max stepped behind a privacy screen and changed. The suit fit like it had been grown on his body. The fabric—some kind of super-fine wool—felt like water against his skin. When he emerged, Marcus was nodding.

"Better. But we need the right shirt. Sea island cotton, not Oxford. And shoes—John Lobb, I think. Nothing too flashy. You're successful, not desperate to prove it."

For the next two hours, they dressed and undressed Max like a doll. Five suits. Casual wear that cost more than his monthly salary. A leather jacket that Marcus assured him was "the one" after rejecting seven others. Each item was catalogued, photographed, and added to Maxwell Reed's digital wardrobe inventory.

"Now the details," Marcus said, settling into a leather chair and gesturing for Max to sit opposite. Sarah took a position nearby with a tablet, ready to take notes.

Marcus pulled out his phone—the same model Max would carry—and began scrolling. "Maxwell Reed dines at Saison in San Francisco, Eleven Madison Park in New York, Mugaritz when in Spain. You don't need to have been to all of them, but you need to know them. Know the chefs. Know which dishes to reference."

He swiped to another screen. "You collect contemporary art. Nothing too avant-garde—you're not trying to be edgy. Banksy is passé. Hockney is safe. You have a small Kusama piece in your home office. You bid on a Basquiat last year at Christie's but dropped out at twelve million. You have limits."

Max felt something shift in his chest. "Do I?"

Marcus looked up, one eyebrow raised. "Maxwell Reed does. You're building wealth, not born into it. Made your first million on an early exit from a fintech startup in 2016. Since then, you've had three more successful investments. Your portfolio is strong but not spectacular. You're hungry. Still proving yourself. That's why you're at these conferences—still hunting for the next big score."

Sarah leaned forward. "We've created a complete digital footprint. Social media going back eight years. LinkedIn connections with real people who've been briefed to confirm they know you if contacted. Articles mentioning your investments in TechCrunch and VentureBeat. You exist, Max. Maxwell Reed exists."

"Wine," Marcus continued. "You prefer Burgundy to Bordeaux. You can discuss terroir without sounding pretentious. You know the difference between a grand cru and premier cru. You own a small stake in a Napa winery—more for the networking than the returns."

The information kept coming. Cars—Maxwell Reed drove a Tesla Model S in San Francisco, leased a Porsche Taycan for his New York trips. Watches he'd owned before the IWC. Hotels he preferred. The names of sommeliers and maître d's who would greet him warmly. The tech blogs he read. The podcasts he listened to during his morning runs through Presidio Park.

Max's head began to swim. Maxwell Reed had a whole life—a life more detailed and documented than his own in some ways. A life built from spreadsheets and algorithms and carefully placed digital breadcrumbs.

"Stand up," Marcus said suddenly.

Max rose, and Marcus circled him slowly, studying him from every angle.

"Look at yourself," Marcus said, gesturing to a full-length mirror that had been wheeled into position.

Max turned and saw a stranger.

The midnight blue suit draped perfectly across his shoulders. The rose gold watch caught the light. The John Lobb oxfords gleamed. His hair had been subtly restyled—still short, but softer somehow, less severe. Even his posture had changed during the briefing, relaxing into the clothes, into the persona.

Maxwell Reed looked back at him from the mirror. Confident. Successful. Belonging to a world of private jets and disruption and casual millions.

Max Monroe—the man who'd spent three years in Syrian safe houses, who'd killed a man with a broken bottle in a Karachi alley, who carried his sister's photo in a wallet held together with duct tape—was nowhere to be seen.

"Good," Marcus said. "You look uncertain. That's the last honest thing I want to see from you. When you walk into that summit in Barcelona, you need to believe you're Maxwell Reed. Not act like him. *Be* him."

Sarah was watching Max's face in the mirror, her expression unreadable. "How does it feel?"

Max touched the watch, felt its weight again. Felt the suit's fabric against his skin. Felt the distance between who he was and who he was pretending to be stretching like a chasm.

"Like I'm disappearing," he said quietly.

"Good," Marcus repeated. "That means it's working." He checked his own watch—something vintage and complicated. "We have three more sessions scheduled. Dining etiquette tomorrow. Tech sector deep-dive the day after. Then you fly to Barcelona."

He gathered his materials and headed for the door, then paused. "One more thing, Mr. Monroe. Maxwell Reed is charming. He makes people feel interesting. He asks good questions and listens to the answers. He's the kind of man people want to confide in, to impress, to be close to." Marcus's pale eyes held Max's. "He's exactly the kind of man our killer likes to destroy."

After Marcus left, Sarah remained, still holding her tablet. The wardrobe department suddenly

**Scene 6: Max conducts a final run-throu...**

**Scene 6: Max conducts a final run-through of his cover story**

The mock interview room at Langley bore an unsettling resemblance to the private lounges Max had seen in photographs of tech conferences—minimalist furniture in charcoal and chrome, floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking what was meant to simulate a Barcelona skyline, even the faint scent of expensive coffee lingering in the air. The Agency's environmental designers had outdone themselves. Only the one-way mirror along the eastern wall betrayed the room's true purpose.

Max sat in a leather chair that probably cost more than his monthly salary, facing a semicircle of interrogators. Carver occupied the center position, flanked by Sarah Chen and Dr. Huang. Two additional specialists from the identity division rounded out the panel—a woman named Torres who'd spent fifteen years embedded in Silicon Valley venture capital, and a man called Brennan whose tech startup had been a CIA front before going legitimately public.

"Let's begin," Carver said, his fingers steepled. The overhead lights cast shadows across his face that made his earlier nervousness seem like a distant memory. Here, in this controlled environment, he was all business. "Mr. Reed, your fund's performance has been... inconsistent. Three successful exits, but your last two investments went nowhere. Why should anyone take your calls?"

Max leaned back, allowing Maxwell Reed to settle over him like a second skin. "Because I learn from my mistakes, James. And because the two failures taught me more about identifying genuine innovation than the three successes ever could. Anyone can throw money at a sure thing. I'm interested in the ideas that make people uncomfortable."

"Uncomfortable how?" Sarah Chen's voice cut like a scalpel. She'd traded her usual professional attire for something more befitting the tech elite—a tailored blazer over a vintage band t-shirt, designer jeans. The transformation was jarring.

"The kind that challenge existing power structures," Max said. "Decentralized systems. Privacy-focused platforms. Technology that shifts control back to individuals rather than concentrating it in corporate or government hands."

Dr. Huang scribbled something on his tablet. The psychologist had been silent so far, but Max could feel the weight of his observation. Every word, every gesture was being analyzed for authenticity.

Torres leaned forward. "You're at a rooftop reception in Barcelona. Champagne, canapés, the Mediterranean stretching out below. Elena Vasquez approaches you—she's the CEO of a quantum computing startup that's been making waves. She asks what you're working on. What do you tell her?"

Max didn't hesitate. "I tell her I'm not working on anything—I'm listening. Then I ask her what keeps her up at night. Not about her company, about the technology itself. What scares her about what she's building."

"Why that question?" Brennan asked. His tone was neutral, but his eyes were sharp.

"Because anyone can pitch their success. But the people who understand the implications of their work, who wrestle with the ethical dimensions—those are the ones building something that matters. Those are the ones worth backing."

Carver's expression remained neutral, but Max caught the slight nod. He was performing well. Maxwell Reed was becoming real.

"Your father was a factory worker in Detroit," Sarah said, reading from a file that Max knew contained his fabricated history. "Died when the automotive industry collapsed. Your mother cleaned houses to put you through community college. Now you're worth forty million dollars. How does that shape your investment philosophy?"

The question landed harder than Max expected. The fictional backstory had been crafted to explain Maxwell Reed's outsider status in Silicon Valley, but hearing it spoken aloud gave it weight, substance. He could almost see the father who'd never existed, feel the phantom weight of a childhood he'd never lived.

"It means I know what it's like when technology leaves people behind," Max said quietly. "When innovation becomes a weapon wielded by the few against the many. My father's factory closed because someone decided robots were cheaper than human dignity. So when I evaluate an investment, I ask myself: does this serve people, or does it serve power?"

The room fell silent. Dr. Huang's stylus had stopped moving. Sarah's expression had shifted into something Max couldn't quite read. Even Carver seemed momentarily caught off guard.

Torres broke the silence. "That's... actually a compelling narrative. But can you back it up? Name three investments that reflect that philosophy."

Max rattled off the companies from his legend—a worker-owned tech cooperative in Oakland, a privacy-focused messaging platform, an AI ethics consultancy. Each one carefully selected by the identity division to be real enough to verify but small enough not to draw excessive scrutiny. He added details about the founders, their missions, the challenges they faced. Maxwell Reed's portfolio came alive in his words.

"What about MindFrame?" Brennan asked suddenly. "The neural interface company. Rumor is they're looking for Series B funding. Would Maxwell Reed be interested?"

It was a trap question—MindFrame didn't exist. Max smiled. "I'd need to see their approach to data ownership and user consent before I could answer that. Neural interfaces are intimate technology. If they're building another platform for harvesting thoughts to sell to advertisers, I'll pass. If they're creating tools that genuinely augment human capability while respecting cognitive privacy, we should talk."

Brennan's lips quirked. "Good catch."

The questions continued for another forty minutes. They probed every aspect of his legend—his education, his first job, his breakout investment, his failed marriage to a woman who'd left him for a Google executive. They tested his knowledge of cryptocurrency protocols, his opinions on various AI researchers, his views on the tech industry's relationship with government surveillance.

Max answered it all, weaving truth and fiction until he could no longer distinguish between them. Maxwell Reed's memories felt as real as his own. The man's disappointments, his ambitions, his carefully cultivated cynicism about the tech industry's promises—all of it crystallized into something coherent and believable.

Finally, Carver raised a hand. "Last question. What drives you, Maxwell? Really drives you. Strip away the philosophy and the backstory. When you're alone at night, what keeps you doing this?"

Max opened his mouth to deliver another carefully constructed answer, but something made him pause. In the silence, he felt the weight of the past three days—the photographs of the dead, the clinical discussions of venom and murder, the careful construction of a man who didn't exist to hunt a killer who kissed their victims to death.

"I think..." he began, then stopped. Started again. "I think I believe that technology should serve humanity, not control it. That innovation without ethics is just power without accountability. And maybe, somewhere in this world of billion-dollar valuations and disruption theater, there are still people trying to build something that matters. Something that makes us more human, not less."

The words hung in the air. Max realized, with a strange sense of vertigo, that he'd meant them. Not as Maxwell Reed. As himself. The lie had become truth somewhere in the telling, or perhaps the truth had always been hiding beneath the lies.

Dr. Huang set down his tablet. "That," he said softly, "was either the best performance I've seen in twenty years, or you just had a moment of genuine revelation. I'm not sure which concerns me more."

Carver stood, signaling the end of the exercise. "You're ready. The Barcelona summit is in seventy-two hours. Sarah will have your documents, credit cards, and tech by tomorrow morning. You'll fly commercial—first class, obviously. Maxwell Reed doesn't do government transport."

The others began gathering their materials, but Max remained seated, still processing the strange disconnect between the man he was pretending to be and the man he might actually be becoming.

Sarah approached as the room emptied. "You okay? You looked... somewhere else there at the end."

"Just getting into character," Max said, but the words felt hollow.

She studied him with those sharp, analytical eyes. "Be careful in Barcelona. This isn't just about maintaining a cover. The people you'll be meeting—they're brilliant, charismatic, and some of them are genuinely trying to change the world. It's easy to forget why you're really there."

"I won't forget."

"I hope not." She handed him a slim folder. "Background on the summit attendees. Memorize it. Some of these people might be targets. Some might be witnesses. And one of them might be the person you're hunting."

Max took the folder, feeling its weight. Inside were photographs, biographies, connection maps. Somewhere in those pages was a killer who'd perfected murder into an art form.

Carver lingered near the door after the others had left. His earlier nervousness had returned, subtle but present in the way he shifted his weight, the way his eyes wouldn't quite meet Max's.

"Something you want to tell me
