**Scene 1: Marcus wakes to the aftermath of a severe storm and discovers Bruno**

The storm had rearranged the world.

Marcus stood on the back porch in his too-short pajama pants, garbage bag dangling from one hand, staring at what used to be his backyard. Branches thick as his arm littered the grass like broken bones. The old oak tree near the fence had lost half its crown, leaving a jagged wound against the gray morning sky. Water pooled in the low spots, reflecting clouds that still looked bruised and angry.

His mom had shaken him awake twenty minutes ago—"Marcus, the trash, please, before I leave for work"—already dressed in her scrubs, already halfway out the door in her mind. He'd stumbled downstairs to find her gone, the coffee pot still warm, a Post-it note on the counter reminding him about leftover casserole for dinner.

The same as every morning. The same as the last six months.

Marcus picked his way across the soggy lawn, his sneakers squelching with each step. The air smelled like wet earth and torn leaves, that electric scent that lingered after lightning. A shingle from someone's roof had landed near the garden shed. He'd have to deal with that later.

The trash cans had blown over during the night—he could hear them banging around from his bedroom, competing with the thunder. They lay on their sides near the back fence, lids scattered, garbage spilling out onto the muddy ground. Great. He'd be picking up trash for an hour.

Marcus was reaching for the first can when he heard it.

A sound. Soft. Almost like a whimper.

He froze, hand extended, listening.

There it was again—a small, frightened noise coming from behind the overturned cans.

Probably a raccoon, he thought, taking a cautious step forward. Or a possum. Something that got trapped during the storm and was now cornered and scared, which meant dangerous. He should go back inside, let it find its own way out.

But something made him move closer.

"Hey," he said quietly, the way his dad used to talk to stray cats. "It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you."

He crouched down, peering into the gap between the fence and the trash cans.

Two dark eyes stared back at him.

Marcus's breath caught in his throat.

It wasn't a raccoon.

The cub was small—maybe the size of a cocker spaniel—with wet, matted fur the color of dark honey. It pressed itself against the fence, body trembling, making that soft whimpering sound again. One of its ears was torn, just slightly, and there was a scratch across its snout that looked fresh.

A bear cub. In his backyard. In suburban Riverside Heights, where the most exotic wildlife was usually Mrs. Chen's escaped parakeet.

Marcus didn't move. Couldn't move. His heart hammered against his ribs as his brain tried to catch up with what his eyes were seeing.

The cub whimpered again, and Marcus saw how its whole body shook—not just from fear, he realized, but from cold. The morning air was cool after the storm, and the cub was soaked through, probably had been out in the weather all night.

"Where's your mom?" Marcus whispered, even though he knew the cub couldn't answer. His eyes scanned the yard, half-expecting to see a massive adult bear come crashing through the fence. But there was nothing. Just the debris-strewn grass and the dripping trees and this tiny, terrified animal.

Slowly—so slowly—Marcus extended his hand.

The cub flinched, pressing harder against the fence, but it had nowhere to go. It was trapped by the overturned cans, by the fence, by whatever circumstances had brought it here in the middle of a storm.

"It's okay," Marcus heard himself say. "You're okay."

The cub's eyes never left his face. They were dark and wet and utterly terrified, and something in Marcus's chest twisted tight. He knew that look. He'd seen it in his own mirror often enough these past months—that expression of being lost and alone and not knowing what to do about it.

His hand was inches from the cub's nose now. He could see its nostrils flaring, could see the rapid rise and fall of its small chest.

"I'm not gonna hurt you," Marcus whispered. "I promise."

The cub made a sound—not quite a whimper, not quite a growl. More like a question.

Marcus held perfectly still, hand outstretched, barely breathing.

And then, so gently he almost didn't feel it, the cub's wet nose touched his fingertips.

**Scene 2: Marcus returns inside to find ...**

**Scene 2: Marcus returns inside to find his mother rushing to get ready for work**

Marcus slipped through the back door, his heart still hammering against his ribs. The kitchen smelled like burnt coffee and the vanilla air freshener his mother sprayed obsessively to mask it. He could hear her moving around in the living room, the familiar soundtrack of her morning routine—drawers opening, keys jangling, the weather report droning from the television.

He stood frozen by the door, his sneakers leaving muddy prints on the linoleum. Through the doorway, he could see her reflection in the hallway mirror as she struggled with an earring, phone wedged between her shoulder and ear.

"I know, I know. I'm leaving in five minutes," she was saying, her voice tight with stress. "The storm knocked out power at the east branch. They need me there to—yes, I understand that."

Marcus took a cautious step forward. His mother didn't turn around.

The television caught his attention. The local morning news filled the screen, and his stomach dropped when he saw the headline scrolling across the bottom: **ZOO OFFICIALS SEARCH FOR ESCAPED BEAR CUB**.

"—authorities are asking residents in the Riverside and Oakmont neighborhoods to check their yards and report any sightings," the news anchor was saying. Behind her, footage played of zoo workers in khaki uniforms spreading out across a residential street. Marcus recognized the street sign—they were only three blocks away.

His mother finally emerged from the hallway, jacket half-on, laptop bag sliding off her shoulder. She glanced at him, and for a moment, her eyes actually focused on his face.

"You're up early," she said, then immediately looked away, checking her watch. "Did the storm wake you? I heard trees coming down all night."

"Yeah, I—"

"I have to go. There's cereal in the cupboard." She was already moving toward the counter, gathering her things—phone, keys, the travel mug she'd forgotten to fill. "Mrs. Chen next door is home if you need anything. I'll try to be back by six, but with the power situation..."

She trailed off, distracted by something on her phone screen. Marcus stood there, acutely aware of the bear cub hiding less than fifty feet away. He should tell her. He knew he should tell her. The words were right there, crowding his throat.

*Mom, there's a bear in our garage.*

But she wasn't looking at him anymore. She never really looked at him anymore, not since Dad left for the oil rig job in Alaska. Eight months ago, he'd promised it would only be six months. Now the calls came less frequently, and when they did, Mom's voice went flat and careful, like she was talking to a stranger.

On the television, the news anchor continued: "The cub's mother died three weeks ago from complications during a routine procedure. Zoo officials say the young bear has been distressed and refusing food. They're concerned for his safety and are asking—"

Marcus's chest tightened. The cub's mother was dead. Bruno was alone, just like—

"Marcus? Are you listening?"

He blinked. His mother was staring at him now, one hand on the doorknob, impatience radiating from every line of her body.

"Stay inside today, okay? With that bear loose, I don't want you wandering around." She paused, seemed to actually see him for a second. "You look pale. Are you feeling alright?"

"I'm fine."

The moment stretched between them, fragile as spider silk. Then her phone buzzed, and just like that, she was gone—mentally first, then physically, the door closing behind her with a decisive click.

Marcus stood in the empty kitchen, listening to her car start in the driveway. The refrigerator hummed. The television continued its coverage of the search, now showing a photo of Bruno—his photo, Marcus realized, from before. The cub looked smaller on screen, more helpless.

His mind raced. They were searching the neighborhood. They'd find Bruno eventually. Someone would hear him, see him, call the authorities. And then what? Back to the zoo, back to a cage, alone and scared and—

No.

The decision crystallized in his chest, hard and certain and probably stupid. But it was *his* decision. For once, something was his to control, his to protect, his to keep.

Marcus moved quickly, quietly, pulling open the refrigerator. Milk—he grabbed the half-gallon, then thought better of it and poured some into a plastic container instead. His mother wouldn't notice. She never noticed what was missing, only what was in her way.

He found leftover chicken in a Tupperware, some cheese, an apple. He stuffed everything into his backpack, hands shaking slightly with adrenaline and something that felt dangerously close to purpose.

The television droned on behind him: "—asking anyone with information to call the zoo's emergency hotline—"

Marcus grabbed a bowl from the cupboard and headed for the back door. Through the window, he could see the garage, its side door slightly ajar where he'd left it. Inside, a frightened cub was waiting, needing him, depending on him.

For the first time in eight months, Marcus felt like he mattered.

He stepped outside, letting the door close softly behind him, sealing his secret inside the walls of his empty house.

**Scene 3: Marcus lures Bruno into the cl...**

**Scene 3: Marcus lures Bruno into the cluttered garage**

Marcus's hand trembled as he held out a slice of honey-glazed ham from last night's dinner. The cub's wet nose twitched, black eyes fixed on the offering with a mixture of hunger and fear.

"Come on," Marcus whispered, taking a slow step backward toward the garage. "It's okay. I promise."

Bruno—Marcus had already named him, though he wasn't sure when exactly the decision had been made—remained pressed against the fence, his matted fur making him look smaller than he probably was. Maybe forty pounds. Maybe less.

Marcus took another step back. The garage door yawned open behind him, its interior a cave of shadows and forgotten things. His mom kept threatening to clean it out, but between her double shifts at the hospital and her weekend administrative work, the threat remained empty. Now Marcus was grateful for her exhaustion.

The ham glistened in the morning light. Bruno's stomach made a sound like water going down a drain.

"That's it," Marcus said, moving backward again. His heel caught on the garage's threshold, but he steadied himself. "Just a little closer."

The cub moved. One paw, then another. His gait was uneven, favoring his left side. Marcus noticed a small cut above his front leg, crusted with dried blood and dirt. The knot in his chest tightened.

Three more steps and Bruno crossed into the garage.

Marcus tossed the ham deeper inside, near the old workbench his dad had built before he'd left for the oil rig job in Alaska. Six months ago, he'd said. Just six months. It had been eight.

Bruno lunged for the meat, and Marcus quickly pulled the garage door down, leaving it open just six inches to let in light and air. His heart hammered against his ribs as he fumbled for the pull-string light. The bulb flickered on, casting everything in harsh yellow.

The cub froze mid-chew, ham dangling from his mouth.

"Hey, hey, it's okay." Marcus dropped to his knees, making himself smaller. Less threatening. He'd read that somewhere once, maybe in one of those nature documentaries his dad used to watch. "You're safe here."

Bruno swallowed the ham and backed up until his hindquarters hit a stack of paint cans. The cans rattled but didn't fall. The cub's breathing came fast and shallow.

Marcus stayed still, letting Bruno adjust to the space. The garage smelled like motor oil, old cardboard, and something vaguely moldy that might have been the camping equipment shoved in the far corner. Dust motes swirled in the light, and somewhere in the rafters, something skittered. Probably mice.

After what felt like hours but was probably only two minutes, Marcus reached slowly into his hoodie pocket and pulled out another piece of ham. He placed it on the concrete floor between them and slid it forward.

Bruno's nose worked the air. His ears—rounded and almost comically small—swiveled forward.

"That's right," Marcus said softly. "I've got more. Lots more."

The cub crept forward, belly low to the ground. He snatched the ham and retreated, but not as far this time. Progress.

Marcus spent the next twenty minutes like this, creating a trail of food that led Bruno deeper into the garage, toward the back corner where his dad's old furniture sat covered in paint-stained tarps. A broken armchair. A coffee table with one short leg. Boxes of books his mom couldn't bear to donate.

It was perfect.

Working quickly while Bruno demolished the last piece of ham, Marcus rearranged the space. He dragged the armchair to create a barrier, stacked boxes to form walls, and spread out the tarp to make a floor. The result was a small cave-like area, hidden from view if someone opened the garage door. His mom never came in here anyway—too many memories of Dad, probably—but it felt safer this way.

From the utility shelf, he grabbed old beach towels, faded and frayed. He spread them in the makeshift den, creating something soft. Something that looked almost comfortable.

Bruno watched from beside the workbench, his body tense but his eyes curious.

"Look," Marcus said, sitting cross-legged near the entrance to the den. "It's for you. Your own space."

The cub didn't move.

Marcus pulled out his phone, fingers flying across the screen. *Bear cub care*. *What do bear cubs eat*. *How to help injured bear*.

The search results loaded, but one news article caught his eye first. His stomach dropped as he read the headline: "Zoo Cub Escapes During Storm—Mother Deceased, Officials Searching."

He clicked it.

*Bruno, a six-month-old black bear cub, escaped from the Riverside Zoo during last night's severe weather. The cub's mother, Bella, died two weeks ago from complications related to a chronic illness. Zoo officials believe the cub fled through a damaged section of fence and are asking residents to report any sightings. "Bruno is frightened and alone," said head zookeeper Patricia Mendez. "We need to find him before he gets hurt or hurts someone else."*

Marcus's vision blurred. He blinked hard, forcing the tears back.

Bruno's mother was dead. Just like that. Gone.

Marcus knew that feeling. Not death, exactly, but gone. His dad's voice on the phone every Sunday, growing more distant each week. The way his mom looked through him at breakfast, her mind already at the hospital. The empty chair at dinner. The silence that filled their house like water, drowning everything.

He looked at the cub, really looked at him. Bruno had curled into a tight ball beside the workbench, his fur still damp and dirty, his small body shaking.

"We're the same, you and me," Marcus whispered.

He grabbed another towel from the shelf, this one slightly cleaner, and approached slowly. Bruno's eyes tracked him but the cub didn't run. Progress.

"I'm going to clean you up a little, okay? That cut needs attention."

Marcus knelt beside Bruno and gently pressed the towel against the cub's fur. Bruno flinched but didn't pull away. The towel came away brown with mud and streaked with blood.

"Easy," Marcus murmured, working carefully around the cut on Bruno's leg. It wasn't deep, but it needed cleaning. He'd have to sneak some first-aid supplies from the bathroom.

As he worked, Bruno's breathing slowed. The shaking subsided. When Marcus moved the towel across the cub's back, Bruno made a sound—not quite a purr, but something close. A rumble of contentment.

Marcus's chest ached with something he couldn't name. When was the last time someone had needed him like this? When was the last time he'd mattered?

"You're going to be okay," he said, more to himself than to Bruno. "We both are."

He worked until Bruno's fur looked less like a disaster and more like actual fur—dark and surprisingly soft. The cub's eyes had started to droop, exhaustion finally overtaking fear.

Marcus guided Bruno toward the den he'd created, using gentle pressure and soft words. This time, the cub followed without resistance. Bruno stepped into the nest of towels, circled twice, and collapsed with a heavy sigh.

Marcus sat at the entrance, watching Bruno's breathing even out into sleep. His phone buzzed in his pocket—probably his mom, checking in from work—but he ignored it. Outside, he could hear sirens in the distance. Police or animal control, searching the neighborhood.

They wouldn't find Bruno. Marcus would make sure of it.

He reached out slowly and placed his hand on Bruno's side, feeling the rise and fall of the cub's breathing. Warmth spread through his palm, up his arm, settling somewhere in his chest where the loneliness usually lived.

"I've got you," Marcus whispered. "I won't let them take you."

Bruno's paw twitched in sleep, and Marcus wondered if bears dreamed. He hoped so. He hoped Bruno was dreaming of something better than chain-link fences and dead mothers and storms that tore the world apart.

His phone buzzed again. Reality pressing in.

But for now, in this dusty garage with its broken furniture and forgotten things, Marcus had found something that needed him. Something that looked at him and saw someone worth trusting.

He pulled his hand back reluctantly and stood, his knees cracking. He'd need to bring water. More food. Figure out how to keep Bruno quiet when his mom got home.

The problems were already piling up, a weight settling on his shoulders. But when he looked down at the sleeping cub, peaceful and safe in

**Scene 4: Over the next few days, Marcus...**

Over the next few days, Marcus became a thief.

Not a real thief, he told himself as he slipped three hot dogs from the refrigerator into his hoodie pocket. Just borrowing. Just taking care of something that needed him.

The garage had become his second bedroom. He'd cleared a space behind the old lawn mower and his dad's dusty workbench, piling cardboard boxes into a makeshift wall that hid Bruno from anyone who might peek inside. The cub had claimed a nest of blankets Marcus had pulled from the linen closet—his mom wouldn't notice, she never noticed anymore—and arranged them in a tire from his dad's old Mustang project, the one that had been gathering dust since before the divorce.

Bruno looked up as Marcus entered, his small black nose twitching. The fear from that first day had faded into something else: trust. The cub stumbled toward him on unsteady legs, making soft huffing sounds that Marcus had learned meant *hungry* and *happy* and *you're here*.

"I know, buddy. I know." Marcus unwrapped the hot dogs, tearing them into smaller pieces. Bruno's tongue was surprisingly rough against his palm as the cub ate. "Mom bought these for her lunches, so we gotta make them last, okay?"

The cub didn't answer, just kept eating with single-minded focus.

Marcus's phone buzzed in his back pocket. He ignored it. It had been buzzing all morning.

Another buzz. Then another.

With a sigh, he pulled it out. Seven texts from Jade, each one more insistent than the last.

*where are you???*

*marcus seriously*

*you've been weird for three days*

*are you sick? did something happen?*

*ANSWER ME*

*i'm calling*

*picking up would be cool*

As if on cue, his phone lit up with her name. Marcus stared at it, watching it vibrate in his hand. Bruno had finished the hot dogs and was now investigating Marcus's shoelaces with intense curiosity.

He let it go to voicemail.

Thirty seconds later, another text: *ok now i'm actually worried. if you don't answer by tonight i'm coming over*

Marcus's stomach twisted. He typed quickly: *sorry phone was dead. im fine just helping my mom with stuff around the house*

The lie came easier than it should have.

Three dots appeared immediately. Jade was typing. The dots disappeared. Reappeared. Finally: *you never help your mom with stuff around the house*

*new leaf* Marcus typed. *trying to be more responsible*

*...ok weirdo. want to come to the skate park tomorrow?*

Marcus looked at Bruno, who had given up on the shoelaces and was now attempting to climb into his lap. The cub was bigger than he'd been three days ago, Marcus was sure of it. His fur had lost some of its matted, muddy texture. His eyes were brighter.

*cant. lots of chores*

*you're being SO weird*

*sorry*

He pocketed the phone before she could respond and focused on Bruno, who had successfully made it onto his lap and was now gnawing on his thumb with teeth that were sharper than they looked.

"Ow, hey, no biting." Marcus gently extracted his thumb and offered the cub a knotted rope he'd found in the camping supplies instead. Bruno attacked it with enthusiasm.

That night, Marcus sat cross-legged on his bedroom floor with his laptop balanced on his knees, the glow of the screen the only light in the room. His mom had come home at nine, microwaved something, and gone straight to her bedroom. He'd heard her door click shut, heard the muffled sound of her TV through the wall.

She hadn't asked about his day. Hadn't noticed the missing hot dogs, or the half-empty gallon of milk, or the way the garage door now stayed locked from the inside.

He typed into the search bar: *what do baby bears eat*

The results were overwhelming. Formulas and feeding schedules and warnings about proper nutrition. He clicked through page after page, taking notes in the margins of his math homework. Bears needed protein. Fruits. Vegetables. Not human food, definitely not processed human food.

Marcus glanced at the kitchen, mentally cataloging what was in the refrigerator. Apples, maybe. Some sad-looking carrots in the vegetable drawer. Peanut butter?

Another search: *can bears eat peanut butter*

His phone buzzed. Jade again: *seriously tho are you ok? you're never this quiet*

Marcus chewed his lip. The cursor blinked in the search bar. Outside, wind rattled his window, and he thought of Bruno alone in the garage, curled up in his nest of blankets. Was he warm enough? Should Marcus have left more blankets? What if he cried and Mom heard?

*im fine i promise* he typed to Jade. *just tired. talk tomorrow?*

*you better*

He set the phone face-down and returned to his research, clicking through articles about bear development and habitat requirements and dietary needs. Each page made the knot in his stomach pull tighter. He was doing this all wrong. Bruno needed things Marcus couldn't give him. Space. Proper food. Other bears.

But then he thought of the news reports, the zoo officials with their tranquilizer guns and metal cages. He thought of Bruno's mother, dead. He thought of the way the cub had looked at him that first morning, terrified and alone.

Just like Marcus had felt the day his dad left.

"We need each other," Marcus whispered to the empty room. The words sounded hollow, but he repeated them anyway. "We need each other."

At midnight, he crept downstairs to the garage one more time. Just to check. Just to make sure.

Bruno was awake, sitting in his tire-nest with his head tilted, watching the door as if he'd been waiting. When he saw Marcus, his whole body wiggled with what could only be joy.

Marcus sat down beside him, and the cub immediately climbed into his lap, surprisingly heavy, smelling of earth and milk and something wild. Bruno's heartbeat thrummed against Marcus's chest, fast and alive and real.

"Tomorrow I'll get you apples," Marcus promised, stroking the soft fur between Bruno's ears. "And I'll figure out the rest. I will."

The cub yawned, showing pink gums and those sharp little teeth, then settled against Marcus's stomach with a contented sigh.

Outside, a siren wailed in the distance—police or ambulance, Marcus couldn't tell. He froze, holding his breath, but the sound faded away into the night. Just the city. Just normal sounds.

Nothing to worry about.

Marcus stayed there for another twenty minutes, until his legs went numb and Bruno's breathing deepened into sleep. When he finally laid the cub back in the blankets and stood to leave, his phone buzzed one more time.

Jade: *i know somethings up. you know you can tell me anything right?*

Marcus stared at the message for a long moment, his thumb hovering over the keyboard. Then he locked his phone without responding and slipped out of the garage, making sure the door was firmly locked behind him.

Some things, he thought as he climbed the stairs to his room, some things you couldn't tell anyone. Not even your best friend.

Especially not your best friend.

**Scene 5: Late one night, Bruno cries lo...**

**Scene 5: Late one night, Bruno cries loudly, and Marcus rushes to the garage in a panic**

Marcus jolted awake to a sound that turned his blood to ice.

The wail cut through the darkness—high-pitched, desperate, unmistakably not human. Bruno. Marcus threw off his blankets and lunged for his bedroom door, his heart hammering so hard he could feel it in his throat.

The crying grew louder.

*No, no, no, no, no.*

Marcus's bare feet slapped against the hardwood floor as he sprinted down the hallway. He didn't bother with stealth—speed was everything now. The stairs creaked under his weight as he took them two at a time, catching himself on the banister when he nearly lost his balance.

The door to the garage was in the kitchen. Marcus fumbled with the handle, his palms slick with sweat, and burst through into the cold darkness. The smell hit him immediately—the musty odor of old cardboard boxes mixed with the sharper scent of bear, earthy and wild.

"Bruno, shh, please, please shh," Marcus whispered frantically, dropping to his knees beside the nest of blankets.

The cub was sitting upright, his small body trembling, mouth open in another piercing cry. His eyes were squeezed shut, and even in the dim light filtering through the garage window, Marcus could see the wetness on his fur around his snout.

"Hey, hey, I'm here." Marcus scooped Bruno into his arms, pressing the cub against his chest. "I'm here, buddy. You're okay."

Bruno's claws dug into Marcus's t-shirt as another cry built in his throat. Marcus clamped his hand gently over the cub's muzzle—not enough to hurt, just enough to muffle the sound. Bruno squirmed, his small body surprisingly strong.

Then Marcus heard it.

The creak of floorboards directly above him.

His mother's bedroom.

Marcus froze, every muscle in his body locked tight. Bruno continued to whimper against his palm, but quieter now, the sound reduced to pitiful mewls. Marcus held his breath, listening so hard his ears rang.

Another creak. Then another. Footsteps moving across the ceiling toward the hallway.

*She's getting up.*

Marcus's mind raced. The garage door was unlocked—he'd been too panicked to think about locking it behind him. If she came down for water, if she decided to check on the noise, if she opened this door—

He pressed Bruno closer, rocking slightly, making the same soft shushing sounds he'd heard his father make when Marcus was little and couldn't sleep. The cub's breathing was hot and rapid against his palm. Marcus could feel the tiny heartbeat racing beneath the fur.

"Please," Marcus breathed, so quietly he barely heard himself. He wasn't sure if he was talking to Bruno or to whatever force controlled the universe. "Please."

The footsteps moved toward the stairs.

Marcus's own heart was beating so violently he thought it might give them away. He shifted deeper into the shadows behind the old filing cabinet, pulling Bruno with him. The blanket nest rustled. A glass jar on the nearby shelf wobbled.

*Don't come down. Please don't come down.*

The footsteps reached the top of the stairs. Paused.

Bruno whimpered again, softer this time, and Marcus felt the cub's tongue rasp against his palm. The small body was still shaking, but the fight was going out of him. Marcus kept rocking, kept whispering wordless comfort, his eyes locked on the thin line of light beneath the garage door.

A shadow passed across it.

Marcus stopped breathing entirely.

The shadow paused. Marcus could picture his mother on the other side, her hand on the doorknob, her head tilted as she listened. Had she heard? Was she about to turn the handle? What would he say? What could he possibly say that would make this okay?

Seconds stretched into eternities.

Then the shadow moved away. The footsteps retreated—not toward the stairs, but toward the bathroom. A door closed. Water ran through the pipes in the walls.

Marcus's breath came out in a shuddering gasp. His arms were trembling now too, and he realized he was shaking almost as badly as Bruno. The cub had quieted, making small snuffling sounds as he nuzzled against Marcus's chest, seeking warmth, seeking comfort, seeking his mother.

"I know," Marcus whispered, finally removing his hand from Bruno's muzzle. "I know, buddy. I miss mine too."

The water shut off. More footsteps. The bathroom door opened and closed. The creak of bedsprings as his mother climbed back into bed.

Then silence.

Marcus stayed frozen in the shadows for another five minutes, counting his heartbeats, waiting to be sure. Bruno had curled into a ball against his stomach, making the same soft grunting sounds he made when he was falling asleep. The cub's fur was damp where he'd been crying.

When Marcus finally moved, his legs had gone numb. He carefully arranged Bruno back in the blanket nest, tucking the edges around the small body. The cub's eyes were closed now, his breathing deep and even. One paw twitched in his sleep.

Marcus sat back on his heels, wiping his face with shaking hands. His t-shirt was stretched out and covered in cub fur. There were tiny puncture marks where Bruno's claws had gripped him.

This was only the third night.

The thought settled over him like a weight. Three nights, and he'd already almost been caught. How many more close calls could there be before his luck ran out? Before his mother heard, before Jade figured it out, before the zoo expanded their search?

Bruno sighed in his sleep, a sound so small and trusting it made Marcus's chest ache.

He reached out and gently stroked the cub's head, feeling the velvet softness of his ears. Bruno leaned into the touch without waking, seeking contact even in his dreams.

"I'll figure it out," Marcus whispered to the sleeping cub, to himself, to the darkness. "I promise. I'll figure it out."

But as he crept back toward the garage door, moving with exaggerated care across the concrete floor, Marcus couldn't shake the image of that shadow pausing beneath the door. Couldn't forget how close they'd come.

He paused with his hand on the doorknob, looking back at the small mound of blankets barely visible in the darkness. Tomorrow he'd have to be smarter. More careful. He'd need to find a way to keep Bruno quiet at night, to cover their tracks better, to stop Jade from asking questions he couldn't answer.

Tomorrow.

But tonight, all he could do was slip back into the house like a ghost, climb the stairs without making a sound, and lie awake in his bed, listening for any sign that his mother was still awake, still suspicious, still wondering what that sound had been.

The house remained quiet. But Marcus knew, with a certainty that sat heavy in his gut, that the quiet wouldn't last forever.

**Scene 6: Marcus sits in the garage watc...**

**Scene 6: Marcus sits in the garage watching Bruno sleep**

The garage smelled like motor oil and damp cardboard, with a new layer of something wild underneath—earth and fur and the faint sweetness of spilled milk. Marcus had cracked the side window open an inch, just enough to let in the evening air without making it obvious from outside that anything had changed.

Bruno was curled in the nest Marcus had built from his old camping blankets and a sleeping bag his dad had left behind. The cub's breathing came slow and steady now, his small chest rising and falling beneath the brown fur that was still matted in places from the storm. One paw twitched, and Marcus wondered what bears dreamed about.

He shifted his weight on the overturned milk crate he'd dragged over to sit on, his back against the workbench where his dad's tools still hung in neat rows. The garage felt different now—not just the forgotten storage space where broken things went to wait. It felt alive. Important.

Marcus pulled out his phone and scrolled through the notes he'd taken. *Bear cubs nurse 5-6 times daily. Omnivores but need protein. Can't digest cow's milk well—goat milk better.* He'd have to figure that out tomorrow. The kitchen was already missing half a carton of milk and most of the lunch meat. His mom hadn't noticed yet, but she would.

His phone buzzed. Jade again.

*seriously where were you after school? you NEVER skip our wednesday walk home*

Marcus's thumbs hovered over the keyboard. He could see her face in his mind—eyebrows raised, that look she got when she knew he was hiding something. They'd been best friends since fourth grade, when she'd moved in three houses down and declared that his comic book collection was "acceptable but needed more diverse titles." She could read him like one of those comics.

*had stuff to do. all good*

Three dots appeared immediately, then disappeared. Then appeared again. Finally:

*you're being weird*

*im fine*

*that's what people say when they're not fine*

He turned the phone face-down on his knee.

Bruno made a small sound, somewhere between a whimper and a sigh, and shifted in the blankets. Marcus froze, but the cub didn't wake. In the dim light from the single bulb overhead, Bruno looked smaller than he had this morning. Fragile. The news had said his mother died three weeks ago. Some kind of infection. They'd been trying to bottle-feed him, but he wasn't adjusting well to captivity.

*Wasn't adjusting well.* That's what the zoo spokesperson had said, her voice professionally sympathetic. Like Bruno was a broken appliance that wouldn't work right.

Marcus knew what that felt like.

His phone buzzed again, but it wasn't Jade this time. It was a news alert: *Zoo officials expand search for missing bear cub. "We're concerned for his safety," says director. "He's vulnerable without his mother."*

The knot in Marcus's stomach tightened. He should call them. He knew that. There was probably a reward, and definitely people who actually knew what they were doing. People with the right food and medicine and whatever else a bear cub needed.

But then Bruno's eyes opened—just a crack—and found Marcus in the shadows. The cub made a soft huffing sound, not scared, just checking. Making sure he wasn't alone. Then his eyes drifted closed again, and his breathing deepened back into sleep.

Marcus felt something crack open in his chest, warm and terrifying.

When was the last time anyone had looked for him like that? His mom was working a double shift tonight—again. His dad called every Sunday from the oil fields in Alaska, their conversations awkward and full of long pauses. "How's school?" "Fine." "Your mom doing okay?" "Yeah." "Well, I should let you go."

Nobody *needed* him. Not really. Not the way Bruno did.

Marcus stood slowly, his legs stiff from sitting. He moved closer to the nest and crouched down, careful not to wake the cub. Bruno's fur was getting fluffier as it dried, standing up in little tufts around his ears. One of those ears had a small notch in it—maybe from birth, maybe from something else.

"I know this is crazy," Marcus whispered. "I know I don't know what I'm doing."

Bruno's paw twitched again.

"But I'm not going to let them put you in a cage. You've been through enough."

The words sounded braver than he felt. His phone buzzed one more time—his mom, texting that she'd be home by midnight, there was leftover pizza in the fridge. Marcus typed back a quick response, then opened his notes app again.

*Day 1—Bruno ate, drank water, sleeping. Seems less scared. Need to get better food. Need to keep him quiet at night. Need to figure out how long before someone notices.*

He stared at that last line. How long *could* this last? A week? A few days? The rational part of his brain—the part that sounded like Jade—knew this was temporary at best, disaster at worst.

But the other part, the part that had felt hollow for months, was already planning tomorrow. What he'd feed Bruno for breakfast. How he'd sneak out here before school. Whether he could find a way to make the garage warmer without his mom noticing the electric bill spike.

Marcus reached out and gently touched the top of Bruno's head, just for a second. The fur was impossibly soft.

"We need each other," he said quietly. "That's enough for now."

He stood and walked to the garage door, his hand on the light switch. Bruno was a dark shape in his nest of blankets, peaceful and safe and trusting in a way that made Marcus's throat tight.

Tomorrow would be complicated. Tomorrow would bring new problems, new lies, new risks. But tomorrow was tomorrow.

Tonight, for the first time in a long time, Marcus wasn't alone.

He flicked off the light and slipped through the door into the house, the knot in his stomach still there but somehow easier to carry. Behind him, in the darkness, a small bear cub dreamed of things Marcus couldn't know, while outside the window, the neighborhood settled into its ordinary evening—completely unaware that everything had changed.

## Chapter 2: The Weight of Secrets

**Scene 1: Marcus struggles to keep up wi...**

**Scene 1: Marcus struggles to keep up with Bruno's growing appetite**

Marcus stood in front of the open refrigerator, the cool air washing over his face as he calculated what he could take without raising alarms. His mother had gone upstairs to fold laundry—he had maybe five minutes.

The leftover meatloaf from dinner sat in a glass container, still half-full. His fingers hovered over it, then moved to the deli turkey instead. Less obvious. He grabbed the package, then added a block of cheddar cheese, three apples, and the remains of yesterday's rotisserie chicken that had been picked nearly clean.

His backpack sat open on the kitchen counter, already stuffed with two boxes of granola bars he'd taken from the pantry that morning. He crammed the food inside, the zipper straining as he forced it closed.

"Marcus? You down there?"

His heart jackhammered against his ribs. "Yeah, Mom!"

"Can you bring up the fabric softener when you come? I left it by the washer!"

"Sure!" His voice came out too high, too tight.

He slung the heavy backpack over his shoulder and headed for the garage door, pausing only to grab a gallon of milk. Bruno had developed a taste for it, lapping it up from the paint tray Marcus had repurposed as a feeding dish.

The garage was dim in the fading afternoon light, and for a moment, Marcus couldn't see him. Then a shuffling sound came from behind the stack of storage boxes, and Bruno emerged, already twice the size he'd been two weeks ago. His fur had thickened, glossy and dark, and his paws seemed enormous compared to his body—like he was growing into them piece by piece.

"Hey, buddy," Marcus whispered, kneeling down as Bruno bounded toward him with that rolling, clumsy gait that still held traces of puppyish awkwardness.

But when Bruno reared up to greet him, planting his paws on Marcus's chest, the impact nearly knocked him backward. The cub was *heavy* now, solid muscle beneath the soft fur.

"Okay, okay, down." Marcus tried to push him gently, but Bruno didn't budge, his wet nose snuffling at the backpack. The smell of food had him fixated, a low whining sound building in his throat.

Marcus unzipped the bag and pulled out the turkey, unwrapping it as fast as his shaking hands would allow. Bruno snatched it from his fingers before he could set it down, gulping it in three massive swallows.

"Slow down, you're gonna choke—"

But Bruno was already nosing at the backpack again, more insistent this time. Marcus pulled out the chicken, then the cheese, then the apples, watching in something close to horror as Bruno devoured everything in minutes. It wasn't enough. It was never enough anymore.

The cub looked up at him with those dark, intelligent eyes, and Marcus saw something that made his stomach clench—not the helpless infant he'd found in the woods, but something wilder. Something that was outgrowing this concrete box with its stacks of Christmas decorations and rusty tools.

A scratch at the garage door made them both freeze.

"Marcus?" His mother's voice, closer now. "What are you doing out here? It's almost dark."

Bruno's ears swiveled toward the sound. Marcus's hand shot out, gripping the scruff of the cub's neck—thicker now, harder to hold. "Stay," he hissed.

"Just—just looking for my old baseball glove!" He moved toward the door, positioning himself to block any view inside. "For gym class!"

He cracked the door open six inches. His mother stood there in her work clothes, arms crossed, a crease of worry between her eyebrows.

"In the dark?"

"I was about to turn the light on."

She studied his face, and Marcus felt sweat prickling along his hairline despite the October chill. Behind him, he heard Bruno's claws clicking on the concrete floor.

"What was that noise?"

"What noise?" The words tumbled out too fast.

"That... scratching sound."

"Probably just rats. I'll set some traps." Marcus squeezed through the gap and pulled the door firmly shut behind him, his back pressed against it. "I should really get started on my homework anyway."

His mother's frown deepened. "Speaking of which, Mrs. Chen emailed me. She said you haven't turned in your last two English assignments."

Marcus's mind went blank. Had it been two? He'd lost track of days, of deadlines, of everything except feeding schedules and cleaning up after Bruno and making sure no one heard the increasingly loud sounds coming from the garage.

"I'll make them up. I promise."

"And the food, Marcus." She gestured back toward the kitchen. "I just bought groceries three days ago, and half of it's already gone. I know you're a growing boy, but this is getting ridiculous. Are you having friends over when I'm at work?"

"No, I just—I've been really hungry lately. Growth spurt, like you said."

She looked at him for a long moment, and Marcus forced himself to hold her gaze, to keep his expression open and innocent even as guilt twisted like a knife in his gut.

"Alright," she finally said. "But we need to talk about budgeting. I can't keep buying this much food every week. And get your homework done. No more excuses."

"Yes, ma'am."

She turned back toward the house, and Marcus sagged against the garage door, his legs suddenly weak. Behind him, Bruno whined again—still hungry, always hungry—and scratched at the door with those razor-sharp claws that were getting longer every day.

Marcus pulled out his phone. 6:47 PM. He had a history test tomorrow he hadn't studied for, an English essay due Friday that he hadn't started, and math homework he didn't even understand. His backpack for school was still in his room, unopened since this morning.

But Bruno needed more food. And the garage needed cleaning—it was starting to smell, despite Marcus's best efforts. And there was a torn garbage bag in the corner that needed replacing before his mother decided to come out here and investigate.

The homework could wait.

It had to.

Marcus slipped back into the garage, closing the door softly behind him, and let the darkness swallow him whole.

**Scene 2: At school, Marcus avoids Jade'...**

**Scene 2: At school, Marcus avoids Jade's attempts to talk to him**

The fluorescent lights in the hallway buzzed overhead, casting everything in a sickly yellow glow that made Marcus's head ache. Or maybe that was just the exhaustion. He'd been up until two in the morning trying to clean Bruno's latest mess—the cub had somehow knocked over an entire shelf of his dad's old paint cans, and the garage floor was now streaked with dried hunter green.

Marcus slammed his locker shut and turned to find Jade standing three feet away, her arms crossed over her chest.

"Hey, stranger," she said, her voice carrying an edge he wasn't used to hearing from her. "Remember me? Your best friend?"

Marcus's stomach twisted. The purple streaks in Jade's hair caught the light as she tilted her head, waiting for an answer he couldn't give.

"Hey, yeah, sorry. I've just been—" He shifted his backpack higher on his shoulder, a movement that made the scratches on his arm sting beneath his hoodie. He'd worn long sleeves even though the school's heating system was cranked up high enough to turn the hallways into a sauna. "Really busy."

"Busy." Jade repeated the word like it tasted bad. "Marcus, you haven't answered any of my texts in three days. You disappeared during lunch yesterday. And last week you literally ran away from me in the parking lot."

"I wasn't running, I just—I had to get home."

"For what?"

The question hung between them. Marcus could smell the chemical tang of floor cleaner where the janitor had mopped that morning. A group of freshmen pushed past them, their laughter echoing off the tile walls. One of them bumped Marcus's shoulder, and he winced as pain shot down his injured arm.

"I just have a lot going on right now," Marcus said finally, hating how weak it sounded.

Jade's expression softened slightly. She stepped closer, lowering her voice. "Is it your mom? Is she okay?"

"What? No, Mom's fine. She's just working a lot." That part was true, at least. His mother's double shifts at the hospital meant she left before dawn and came home after dark, too exhausted to notice that her son was slowly unraveling.

"Then what is it?" Jade's brown eyes searched his face. "Marcus, you look terrible. When's the last time you slept? And why are you wearing a hoodie when it's like eighty degrees in here?"

"I'm fine."

"You're not fine. Talk to me. Please."

The concern in her voice made something crack inside his chest. For a wild moment, Marcus almost told her everything—about the cub in the garage, about the way Bruno's eyes lit up when Marcus came home, about the terror of keeping this impossible secret. The words climbed up his throat.

But then he imagined saying it out loud. Imagined the look on Jade's face. Imagined her telling him he was crazy, telling him he had to call someone, telling him he had to give Bruno up.

"I really have to get to class," Marcus said, and started walking.

"Marcus—"

He didn't turn around. He could feel Jade's stare burning into his back as he pushed through the crowded hallway, weaving between clusters of students. His heart hammered against his ribs. Behind him, he heard Jade call his name one more time, but he kept walking, faster now, until he rounded the corner and she was out of sight.

The hurt in her voice followed him all the way to Mr. Chen's math class.

---

Marcus slid into his seat just as the bell rang. The classroom smelled like dry-erase markers and the stale air from the ancient heating vents. Mr. Chen was already at the front of the room, sorting through a stack of papers with the grim expression of someone about to deliver bad news.

"Tests from last week," Mr. Chen announced. "Some of you did well. Some of you..." He let the sentence trail off meaningfully.

Marcus's stomach dropped. The test. He'd completely forgotten about the test. Or no, that wasn't quite right—he remembered sitting in this very seat, staring at the equations on the page, but his mind had been miles away. He'd been calculating how many cans of tuna he had left at home, wondering if Bruno would eat canned vegetables, trying to remember if bears needed vitamins.

Mr. Chen moved through the rows, placing tests face-down on desks. Some students flipped theirs over immediately with confident grins. Others touched the corners gingerly, like the papers might bite.

When Mr. Chen reached Marcus's desk, he paused. He set the test down slowly, and Marcus caught a glimpse of red ink bleeding across the top of the page.

"See me after class, Marcus," Mr. Chen said quietly.

Marcus nodded without looking up. His face felt hot.

After Mr. Chen moved on, Marcus lifted the edge of the paper. A giant red F stared back at him, circled twice for emphasis. Below it, Mr. Chen had written: *Did you even study? This is not like you.*

Marcus let the paper fall flat and stared at the equations he'd left blank or answered incorrectly. The numbers swam before his eyes. Around him, Mr. Chen was starting the lesson on quadratic functions, but the words washed over Marcus like static.

All he could think about was Bruno, probably awake by now in the garage, wondering where Marcus was. Had he knocked over the water bowl again? Was he hungry? What if he started making noise and one of the neighbors heard?

Marcus's phone buzzed in his pocket—a violation of school rules, but he'd forgotten to silence it. He pulled it out just enough to see the screen. A text from his mom: *Working late again. Leftovers in fridge. Love you.*

Relief and guilt warred in his chest. Another night alone meant another night he could spend with Bruno without questions. But it also meant another night of lying, another night of this crushing weight pressing down on him.

"Marcus?" Mr. Chen's voice cut through his thoughts. "Can you solve this one?"

Marcus looked up at the whiteboard, where an equation sprawled across the surface in blue marker. He had no idea what the question was, let alone the answer.

"I... um..."

"The quadratic formula," Mr. Chen prompted, not unkindly. "We just went over it."

Several students turned to look at Marcus. He felt their eyes on him, felt the heat rising in his cheeks again. His arm throbbed where Bruno's claws had opened the skin.

"I don't know," Marcus admitted.

Mr. Chen sighed. "Pay attention, please."

The rest of the class crawled by. Marcus tried to focus, tried to copy down the notes on the board, but his handwriting looked shaky and strange. His mind kept drifting back to the garage, to Jade's hurt expression in the hallway, to the growing list of lies he was juggling.

When the bell finally rang, Marcus gathered his things slowly while the other students filed out. Mr. Chen erased the whiteboard in long, deliberate strokes.

"Marcus," he said without turning around. "What's going on with you?"

"Nothing, I just—"

"You're one of my best students. Or you were." Mr. Chen turned to face him, chalk dust on his hands. "This F isn't an isolated incident. You've missed three homework assignments in the past two weeks. You're falling asleep in class. And today you looked like you were a million miles away."

Marcus gripped the strap of his backpack. "I'm sorry. I'll do better."

"Is something happening at home? You can talk to me, you know. Or we can get you in to see the counselor."

"No, really, everything's fine. I just got behind. I'll catch up."

Mr. Chen studied him for a long moment, and Marcus forced himself to meet his teacher's eyes, to keep his expression neutral and calm even though his heart was racing.

Finally, Mr. Chen nodded. "All right. But Marcus—I'm here if you need help. With math or anything else. Okay?"

"Okay. Thank you."

Marcus escaped into the hallway, which had mostly cleared out as students headed to their next classes. He walked quickly, head down, not wanting to run into anyone else who might ask questions he couldn't answer.

He made it almost to the science wing before he saw Jade again.

She was standing by the water fountain, clearly waiting for him. When their eyes met, Marcus's first instinct was to turn around and go the other way. But something in Jade's expression stopped him—not anger, but something sadder and more determined.

She pushed off the wall and started walking

**Scene 3: During an energetic play sessi...**

**Scene 3: During an energetic play session in the garage, Bruno accidentally scratches Marcus's arm**

The garage smelled different now—musky and wild, with undertones of damp earth and something Marcus couldn't quite name. He'd spread old blankets across the concrete floor, creating a makeshift den in the corner where Bruno spent most of his time sleeping or gnawing on the increasingly inadequate supply of dog toys Marcus had bought with his saved allowance.

"Hey, buddy," Marcus whispered, slipping through the side door and clicking it shut behind him. He'd taken to entering through the back entrance, away from the house's main windows. "Miss me?"

Bruno's ears perked up immediately. The cub had doubled in size over the past two weeks, his legs longer and sturdier, his shoulders beginning to show the powerful muscle that would one day make him formidable. He scrambled to his feet, letting out a huffing sound that was somewhere between a grunt and a whine.

Marcus dropped his backpack—homework still undone, math test unstudied for—and knelt on the blankets. Bruno bounded over, all enthusiasm and uncoordinated energy, his paws thudding against the concrete. The impact of his weight nearly knocked Marcus backward.

"Whoa, you're getting strong!" Marcus laughed, wrapping his arms around the cub's thick neck. Bruno's fur was coarser now, less downy, and Marcus could feel the solid warmth of him, the rapid heartbeat beneath his ribs.

They wrestled the way they had every afternoon for weeks, Marcus rolling Bruno onto his back, the cub play-biting at his hands with teeth that were no longer harmless nubs. There was a moment—just a flash—when Marcus noticed how much pressure those jaws could apply, how his fingers ached after Bruno clamped down, even gently.

"Easy, easy," Marcus said, pulling his hand free and ruffling the fur on Bruno's head.

Bruno rolled upright and lunged playfully, his front paws reaching for Marcus's shoulders. It was a game they'd played a hundred times. Marcus would catch those paws, they'd grapple for a moment, and then Marcus would gently push the cub away.

Except this time, Bruno's momentum was too much.

The cub's weight drove Marcus backward, and as Marcus tried to catch himself, Bruno's right paw came down hard on his forearm. Marcus felt the claws—sharp as fishing hooks, longer than he'd realized—drag across his skin.

The pain was immediate and shocking.

"Ah!" Marcus gasped, jerking his arm away.

Bruno stumbled back, confused by the sudden movement, by the sharp sound Marcus had made. The cub's ears flattened against his head.

Marcus cradled his arm against his chest, feeling the hot pulse of blood before he saw it. When he looked down, four parallel lines ran from just below his elbow nearly to his wrist, deep enough that blood was already soaking through his sleeve, spreading in dark blooms across the gray fabric.

"Oh god," Marcus breathed. The garage tilted slightly, his vision swimming.

Bruno approached cautiously, nose extended, making a small worried sound in his throat.

"It's okay," Marcus said automatically, though his voice shook. "It's okay, you didn't mean it."

But his hands were trembling as he peeled back his sleeve. The scratches were worse than he'd thought—angry red gouges, the deepest one still welling blood. He could see the white of tissue beneath.

Bruno pushed his muzzle against Marcus's knee, whimpering.

"I know, I know," Marcus whispered. "Not your fault, buddy. You were just playing."

He stumbled to his feet, dizzy, and made his way to the old utility sink in the corner. The water ran cold over the wounds, stinging so badly he had to bite his lip to keep from crying out. Pink water swirled down the drain. Behind him, he could hear Bruno pacing, agitated.

Marcus found an ancient first aid kit on a shelf—left over from when his dad actually used the garage for projects—and managed to wrap gauze around his forearm with his shaking left hand. The white fabric turned red almost immediately in spots, but the pressure helped. He added more layers, then secured it with medical tape.

His whole arm throbbed in time with his heartbeat.

When he turned around, Bruno was sitting in the middle of the garage, looking smaller somehow, his eyes fixed on Marcus with an expression that seemed almost human in its worry.

Marcus crossed back to him and sank down onto the blankets. "Hey," he said softly. "It's not your fault. You hear me? You're just being a bear. That's what bears do."

Bruno crawled forward and rested his heavy head on Marcus's lap. Marcus stroked the fur between his ears with his good hand, feeling the cub's body relax slightly.

*You're just being a bear.*

The words echoed in Marcus's mind, and for the first time, they didn't sound comforting. They sounded like a warning he'd been ignoring.

Bruno was getting bigger. Stronger. Wilder. The garage that had seemed spacious enough two weeks ago now felt cramped, the cub's restless energy filling every corner. And Marcus—Marcus was just a fifteen-year-old kid who didn't know the first thing about raising a bear.

He looked down at his bandaged arm, at the blood already seeping through the layers of gauze.

"What am I doing?" he whispered.

Bruno made a soft chuffing sound and pressed closer, seeking comfort the way he always did. The cub trusted him completely. Depended on him.

Marcus squeezed his eyes shut. He couldn't think about this now. Couldn't face what it meant. Instead, he wrapped his good arm around Bruno and held on, ignoring the pain radiating up his injured arm, ignoring the voice in his head that was starting to sound like fear.

Tomorrow. He'd figure it out tomorrow.

For now, he just held his bear and pretended everything was fine, even as his blood soaked through the bandages and his heart hammered with something that felt dangerously close to panic.

**Scene 4: Unable to sleep due to his thr...**

**Scene 4: Unable to sleep due to his throbbing arm, Marcus lies in bed remembering his grandmother's abandoned farmhouse**

Marcus stared at the ceiling, tracing the familiar crack that split the plaster like a lightning bolt frozen in time. His arm pulsed with each heartbeat, a steady throb that radiated from beneath the bandages he'd wrapped around the scratches. Three angry lines, deep enough that he'd had to stuff toilet paper against them until the bleeding stopped.

He shifted position, trying to find relief that wouldn't come. The digital clock on his nightstand glowed 2:47 AM in accusatory red numbers.

*Bruno didn't mean it,* he told himself for the hundredth time. *He was just playing. He doesn't know his own strength yet.*

But the pain said otherwise.

Marcus rolled onto his side, wincing as his sleeve brushed the wounds, and his gaze fell on the framed photo on his dresser. His grandmother's farmhouse, taken the summer before she died. He could barely make out the details in the darkness, but he didn't need light to see it—the image was burned into his memory. White clapboard siding, a sagging porch, windows like sleepy eyes looking out over acres of overgrown fields. Behind it, a wall of trees that stretched back into wilderness.

His chest tightened with sudden longing.

The house had been sitting empty for two years now. His mom kept saying they needed to sell it, but she never got around to listing it. Too many memories, she'd said once, her voice going soft and distant. Too hard to let go.

Marcus sat up, ignoring the fresh wave of pain from his arm. His laptop sat on his desk, and before he could second-guess himself, he was opening it, the screen's glow painting his face blue-white in the darkness.

He typed the address into Google Maps, zooming in on the satellite view. There it was—the farmhouse a small rectangle surrounded by green. The nearest neighbor was half a mile away. The woods behind the property went on for miles, eventually connecting to state forest land.

Perfect.

His fingers flew across the keyboard, opening new tabs. *Living off the grid.* *Homesteading for beginners.* *What do black bears eat in the wild.*

The more he researched, the more the fantasy took shape in his mind. He could see it so clearly: Bruno lumbering through the tall grass, fishing in the creek that ran along the property's eastern edge. The two of them living in peaceful isolation, no one to hide from, no lies to tell. Marcus would hunt and forage—well, he'd learn how to hunt and forage. There had to be tutorials for that. He'd homeschool himself, maybe. Or just… not worry about school at all.

At 3:30 AM, he pulled his duffel bag from the closet, moving as quietly as possible. His parents' bedroom was down the hall, and his mom was a light sleeper.

What would he need? Marcus grabbed clothes first—jeans, t-shirts, his warmest hoodie. His hands shook slightly as he folded them, adrenaline mixing with exhaustion. He added a flashlight, his pocketknife, the emergency cash from his desk drawer. Forty-three dollars. Not much, but it was something.

He paused, holding one of his grandmother's quilts that she'd made him when he was little. Bears and pine trees stitched in faded blues and greens. He pressed it to his face, breathing in the ghost of her lavender sachets, and felt tears prick his eyes.

"I'm sorry, Grandma," he whispered. "But I don't know what else to do."

The quilt went into the bag.

His phone buzzed on the nightstand—probably another text from Jade that he wouldn't answer. He ignored it, returning to his laptop. Google Maps again, this time looking at routes. Three hours by car, but he couldn't drive. The bus, maybe? He'd have to figure out how to get Bruno there. A crate in a taxi? No, too expensive, and too many questions.

Details. He'd work out the details.

Marcus pulled up images of the farmhouse, zooming in on each one. The kitchen where Grandma had taught him to make pie crust. The porch where they'd shelled peas on summer evenings. The barn—half-collapsed now, but still standing. Bruno could sleep there. Bears liked dens, didn't they? Enclosed spaces where they felt safe.

He could make this work. He *had* to make this work.

By 4:15 AM, his eyes were burning, but sleep felt impossible. The bag sat under his bed now, hidden but ready. On his screen, a satellite image of the farmhouse glowed like a beacon, like a promise.

Like an escape route from a trap that was closing tighter every day.

Marcus touched his bandaged arm gently, feeling the raised edges of the scratches through the gauze. Tomorrow he'd need to wear long sleeves again, even though the forecast called for eighty degrees. Tomorrow Jade would probably corner him again, demanding answers he couldn't give. Tomorrow his English teacher would ask about the essay he hadn't written.

But maybe there wouldn't be a tomorrow. Not here, anyway.

Maybe tomorrow he'd be gone.

The thought should have scared him. Instead, it filled him with something that felt dangerously close to hope.

**Scene 5: At school, Jade notices blood ...**

The cafeteria smelled like industrial-strength disinfectant and reheated pizza. Marcus sat alone at the far end of a table near the windows, pushing tater tots around his tray with a plastic fork. He'd chosen this spot deliberately—away from the main cluster of tables, away from conversations he'd have to pretend to care about, away from Jade.

But Jade had other plans.

"You're bleeding."

Marcus's head snapped up. She stood across from him, lunch tray balanced on one hip, her dark eyes fixed on his left arm. He followed her gaze and felt his stomach drop. A crimson stain had bloomed through the gray fabric of his hoodie sleeve, small but unmistakable against the worn cotton.

"It's nothing." He pulled his arm against his body, hiding it from view.

"That's not nothing, Marcus." Jade set her tray down with a decisive clatter and slid into the seat across from him. "How long have you been bleeding?"

"I'm fine. Just leave it alone."

"No." The single word was quiet but absolute. "I'm not leaving it alone, and I'm not leaving you alone."

Marcus grabbed his tray and stood abruptly, the metal legs of his chair screeching against the linoleum. Around them, a few heads turned, then lost interest. "I have to go."

He made it three steps before Jade was in front of him, moving faster than he'd anticipated. She didn't touch him, but she stood squarely in his path, arms crossed, blocking the way to the cafeteria doors.

"Move, Jade."

"No."

"I'm serious. Get out of my way."

"So am I." Her voice remained steady, but he could see the hurt flickering in her eyes. "You've been avoiding me for weeks. You look like you haven't slept in days. Your grades are tanking—don't think I haven't noticed Ms. Chen calling you out in English. And now you're literally bleeding through your clothes and pretending it's fine."

"It's not your problem." The words came out harsher than he intended, and he saw her flinch.

"You're my friend. That makes it my problem."

"We're not—" He stopped himself, but the damage was already done. The words hung between them like smoke.

Jade's expression hardened, but her eyes were bright with unshed tears. "We're not what? Friends? Because last I checked, friends don't just disappear. Friends don't ignore texts for three weeks straight. Friends don't lie about everything."

"You don't understand."

"Then help me understand!" Her voice rose, drawing more attention now. She lowered it again, leaning closer. "Whatever is going on with you, Marcus, you don't have to handle it alone. You don't have to shut everyone out."

Marcus felt something crack inside his chest—a dam he'd been reinforcing brick by brick since the day he'd found Bruno. The weight of the secret pressed down on him, suffocating. He could feel the ache in his arm where Bruno's claws had torn through skin, could smell the lingering scent of the garage on his clothes despite washing them twice. He was so tired. Tired of lying, tired of sneaking, tired of carrying this alone.

"I can't tell you." His voice broke on the last word.

Jade's expression softened. She took a small step closer, her voice dropping to barely above a whisper. "Real friends don't abandon each other when things get hard, Marcus. Not you. Not me. Whatever this is—whatever you're hiding—it's eating you alive. I can see it."

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead. Someone laughed too loud at a nearby table. The smell of marinara sauce mixed with the chemical tang of cleaning products. Marcus stood there, tray still in his hands, feeling the blood seep warm and sticky against his forearm.

He thought of Bruno, probably awake by now in the darkened garage, confused about why Marcus hadn't come to feed him before school. He thought of the packed duffel bag hidden under his bed, the fantasy of escape to his grandmother's farmhouse already feeling hollow and impossible. He thought of the scratch marks hidden beneath his sleeve, and the way Bruno had looked at him afterward—not guilty, just curious, because Bruno was still just a cub who didn't understand his own strength.

"If I tell you," he said quietly, "everything changes."

"Everything's already changed," Jade replied. "You just won't let me in to see it."

Marcus looked at her—really looked at her—for the first time in weeks. At the concern etched in her features, the stubborn set of her jaw, the way she stood her ground even though he'd given her every reason to walk away. She was right. She'd always been right.

He set his tray down on the nearest table.

"Not here," he said. "Come with me."

Jade grabbed her backpack without hesitation. "Okay."

They walked out of the cafeteria together, Marcus's sleeve growing darker with blood, Jade matching his stride. The hallway stretched before them, empty and echoing. Marcus's heart hammered against his ribs. In a few minutes, he would tell her everything. In a few minutes, the secret that had been consuming him would finally have a witness.

He didn't know if that terrified him or relieved him.

Maybe both.

**Scene 6: Marcus finally confesses every...**

**Scene 6: Marcus finally confesses everything to Jade**

The classroom smelled of dry-erase markers and old textbooks. Afternoon sunlight slanted through the dusty windows, cutting golden rectangles across the empty desks. Marcus sat in the back corner, his backpack—the one he'd packed for running away—heavy at his feet like an anchor.

Jade stood in the doorway, her arms crossed, her expression unreadable.

"You can't keep avoiding me forever," she said quietly. "This school's not that big."

Marcus stared at his hands. The bandage he'd wrapped around his forearm that morning was already showing a small red bloom where the deepest scratch had reopened. He'd been so careful pulling on his hoodie, but careful didn't matter anymore. Nothing he did mattered.

"I'm not—"

"Marcus." Jade's voice cracked like ice. "I saw the blood. During chemistry. It was soaking through your sleeve."

He pulled his arm closer to his body instinctively, and the movement made him wince. The scratches burned, deep and angry. He could still feel Bruno's weight on his chest from this morning, those innocent eyes staring down at him, tongue lolling. The cub didn't mean to hurt him. Bruno didn't understand his own strength anymore, didn't know his claws could tear skin like paper.

Jade moved closer, her sneakers squeaking on the linoleum. She pulled out the chair beside him and sat down, not touching him, just waiting.

The silence stretched between them like a tightrope. Marcus felt something crack inside his chest—a dam he'd been shoring up with lies and excuses and sleepless nights. His throat tightened.

"I found a bear," he whispered.

Jade blinked. "What?"

"A bear cub. In the woods behind my house. His mother was dead, and he was alone, and I—" Marcus's voice broke. "I couldn't just leave him there."

The words tumbled out then, faster and faster, like water through a broken levee. He told her about the cardboard box and the garage, about stealing food from the kitchen and lying to his mom about homework. He told her about Bruno's soft fur and the way he curled against Marcus's side, about the nights spent sleeping on the cold concrete floor because the cub cried when Marcus left. He told her about the scratches, about how big Bruno was getting, about the fantasy of his grandmother's farmhouse and the bag at his feet packed with everything he owned.

"I was going to leave tonight," Marcus said, his voice hollow. "Just take him and go. Start over somewhere he could be free and I could—" He stopped, swallowing hard. "I could be someone who matters. Someone important to something."

Tears burned hot tracks down his face. He didn't try to stop them.

Jade sat perfectly still, her dark eyes wide. When she finally spoke, her voice was gentle. "Marcus, you matter to me. You know that, right?"

"It's not the same." He wiped his face roughly with his good arm. "You don't need me. Bruno does. Without me, he'd die."

"That's not true." Jade pulled out her phone, her fingers moving quickly across the screen. "I mean, it was true. When you found him. But not anymore."

She turned the phone toward him. The screen showed an article about orphaned wildlife, filled with pictures of bear cubs in rehabilitation centers. She scrolled slowly, showing him images of veterinarians bottle-feeding cubs, of cubs playing together in large outdoor enclosures, of healthy bears being released back into the wild.

"Bear cubs need special nutrition," Jade read quietly. "They need medical care, vaccinations. They need to learn to forage and hunt from experienced handlers. And they need other bears, Marcus. For socialization. So they can eventually survive in the wild."

Marcus stared at the pictures. In one, three cubs tumbled over each other in what looked like supervised play. They looked healthy. Happy. Nothing like Bruno, who spent his days pacing the garage, pawing at the door, crying those terrible sounds that made Marcus's heart ache.

"I'm giving him all of that," Marcus said, but the words felt thin even as he spoke them. "I feed him. I play with him. I—"

"You're feeding him table scraps and dog food," Jade said, not unkindly. "And he hurt you, Marcus. He didn't mean to, but he did. He's going to keep growing. What happens in a month? Two months? What happens when he's too big for the garage? When he's too strong for you to control?"

Marcus thought of Bruno's teeth, already sharp, already capable of tearing through the leather work gloves he'd tried using during playtime. He thought of the way the cub had started testing the garage door, pushing against it with increasing force. He thought of his mother, who would eventually discover the truth. Who would call animal control. Who would have Bruno destroyed because Marcus had been too selfish to do the right thing.

"I don't want to lose him," Marcus whispered. The admission felt like pulling glass from a wound. "He's the only thing that makes me feel like I'm not invisible. Like I'm not just... nothing."

Jade set her phone down and finally reached out, her hand hovering near his shoulder before settling there with gentle pressure. "You're not nothing. You're the person who saved a bear cub's life. You're the person who cared enough to try, even when it was hard. Even when it meant lying and hiding and getting hurt."

She squeezed his shoulder softly. "But keeping Bruno now? That's not saving him anymore. That's keeping him from the life he deserves. From the life he needs."

Marcus closed his eyes. Behind his eyelids, he saw Bruno—not as he was now, cramped and restless in the dim garage, but as he could be. Running through forests, catching fish in streams, growing strong and wild and free. Living the life a bear was meant to live.

The pain in his chest deepened, sharp and terrible and true.

"I don't know how to let him go," Marcus said.

Jade pulled up another webpage, this one for a wildlife rehabilitation center two hours north. "You don't have to do it alone," she said. "I'll help you. We'll figure it out together."

Through the window, the sun was sinking lower, painting the classroom in shades of amber and gold. Marcus thought of Bruno waiting in the garage, probably hungry, probably confused about why Marcus hadn't come home yet. His throat ached with unshed tears.

But for the first time in weeks, the crushing weight on his chest felt lighter. Just a little. Just enough to breathe.

"Okay," he whispered. "Okay."

## Chapter 3: Letting Go

**Scene 1: Marcus's mother opens the gara...**

**Scene 1: Marcus's mother opens the garage door searching for old photo albums and discovers Bruno in his makeshift den, leading to her terrified screams that bring Marcus running from the house.**

Marcus was sprawling across his bed, pretending to read his history textbook while actually scrolling through bear care websites on his phone, when he heard the garage door rumble open.

His entire body went rigid.

It was Tuesday. Mom wasn't supposed to go out there. She never went out there on Tuesdays. She worked late on Tuesdays.

He sat up, phone clattering to the floor, ears straining. Maybe she was just pulling the car in. Maybe she'd forgotten something. Maybe—

The scream shattered the afternoon quiet.

It wasn't a startled gasp or a surprised yelp. It was the kind of scream that came from somewhere primal and terrified, the sound of a person confronting something that shouldn't exist in their ordered world. It rose and rose, cutting through walls and windows, turning Marcus's blood to ice.

He was running before he consciously decided to move, taking the stairs three at a time, his socked feet sliding on the hardwood as he rounded the corner. The door to the garage stood wide open, and his mother's screams had dissolved into rapid, breathless gasps.

"Mom!" Marcus burst through the doorway.

The garage smelled wrong—he'd gotten so used to it that he'd stopped noticing, but now, seeing it through his mother's eyes, the reality crashed over him. The sharp tang of urine from the litter box he'd improvised. The sweet-rot smell of old fruit. The musky, wild scent of bear that clung to everything.

His mother stood frozen near the entrance, one hand pressed against her chest, the other gripping a cardboard box labeled "Photos 2010-2015" so tightly her knuckles had gone white. Her face was pale, eyes wide and unblinking, fixed on the far corner where Marcus had built Bruno's den.

Bruno had emerged from the nest of blankets and was standing on his hind legs, sniffing the air with obvious confusion. He'd grown so much in the past three weeks. He wasn't the tiny, mewling cub Marcus had found anymore. He was nearly forty pounds now, his paws disproportionately large, his claws visible even from across the garage. In the dim light filtering through the dusty window, his eyes caught and reflected the glow, twin amber coins in a dark face.

He looked wild. He looked dangerous.

He looked like exactly what he was: a bear that didn't belong in a suburban garage.

"Marcus." His mother's voice came out strangled, barely above a whisper. She hadn't moved. Hadn't looked away from Bruno. "Marcus, tell me that's not—tell me I'm seeing things. Tell me that's not—"

"Mom, it's okay." Marcus moved slowly, carefully, positioning himself between his mother and Bruno. His heart hammered against his ribs. "He's not dangerous. He won't hurt you. Just—just don't make any sudden movements."

"*Won't hurt me?*" The whisper exploded into something sharp and high. "Marcus, that's a *bear*. There's a *bear* in our garage. How—why—what have you—"

Bruno dropped to all fours and took a step forward, curious about the new person, the new sounds. He made a soft huffing noise that Marcus had learned meant he was interested, investigating.

His mother stumbled backward, the box of photos tumbling from her hands. Pictures scattered across the concrete floor—Marcus as a baby, family vacations, birthday parties, all the documented moments of a normal life. The life that was ending right now, in this moment.

"Stay back!" she shouted at Bruno, then to Marcus: "Make it stay back!"

"Bruno, no. Stay." Marcus used the firm voice he'd practiced, the one he'd seen trainers use in videos. To his relief, Bruno paused, tilting his head in that endearing way that made him look almost like a confused puppy.

Almost. But not quite. Never quite.

"You *named* it?" His mother's voice cracked. "Marcus, what have you done? How long has this been—three weeks? That smell, those noises at night—I thought it was raccoons. You said it was raccoons!"

"I know. I'm sorry. I can explain—"

"Explain? *Explain?*" She was backing toward the door now, her hand fumbling behind her for the frame. "We're calling the police. We're calling animal control. We're—oh my God, Marcus, do you have any idea how dangerous this is? How illegal? How completely—"

Her foot caught on one of the scattered photographs and she stumbled. Bruno, startled by the sudden movement, reared up again and let out a sound—not quite a growl, not quite a bark, but something in between that echoed off the garage walls.

His mother screamed again.

"Mom, please!" Marcus held up both hands, divided between them, protecting each from the other. "Just go inside. I'll handle this. I'll explain everything, I promise, just—please go inside."

She stared at him like she'd never seen him before, this son who had hidden a bear in their garage, who stood between her and a wild animal like it was the most natural thing in the world. Tears streamed down her face.

"I'm calling your father," she said, her voice shaking. "Don't you move. Don't you dare move."

She fled into the house, and Marcus heard the door slam, the lock click. Through the window that looked into the kitchen, he could see her grab her phone with trembling hands, could see her mouth moving rapidly as she spoke.

Marcus turned back to Bruno, who had settled onto his haunches, looking uncertain and afraid. The cub had picked up on the tension, the fear. His ears were flattened against his head.

"It's okay, buddy," Marcus whispered, but his own voice was shaking. "It's going to be okay."

But as he sank down onto the cold concrete floor, surrounded by scattered photographs of a childhood that felt like it belonged to someone else, Marcus knew nothing would ever be okay again.

**Scene 2: Marcus's father arrives home e...**

**Scene 2: Marcus's father arrives home early from his job site, and the family has an intense confrontation in the living room where Marcus must explain his actions while his parents express their fear, anger, and disappointment.**

The gravel crunched in the driveway twenty minutes later—a sound Marcus had been dreading. His father's truck door slammed with a force that seemed to shake the windows.

Marcus sat on the couch in the living room, his mother standing near the fireplace with her arms wrapped tightly around herself. She hadn't spoken to him since calling his father, just stood there staring at the framed family photos on the mantel like they belonged to strangers.

The front door burst open.

His father still wore his dusty work boots and the fluorescent safety vest from the construction site. Concrete dust streaked his jeans. He must have dropped everything and driven straight home—Marcus had never seen him leave work early before.

"Where is it?" His father's voice was low, controlled in a way that was somehow worse than yelling. "Where's the bear?"

"Garage," Marcus whispered. "In the old dog crate."

His father's jaw worked for a moment, then he strode past them toward the garage door. Marcus heard the door open, heard his father's sharp intake of breath, heard the door close again. When his father returned, his face had gone pale beneath his tan.

"Jesus, Marcus." He pulled off his hard hat and set it on the coffee table with shaking hands. "That's a *bear*. A wild animal. In our garage."

"He's not wild," Marcus said, then immediately regretted it.

"Not wild?" His mother's voice cracked. "Marcus, I thought—when I opened that crate and saw those *eyes*—I thought I was going to have a heart attack. Do you understand that? My own son put a *bear* in our garage."

His father sank into the armchair across from Marcus, rubbing his face with both hands. The living room felt too small suddenly, the walls pressing in. The familiar smell of his mother's lavender candles mixed with the dust from his father's clothes, creating something nauseating.

"Start from the beginning," his father said. "And don't leave anything out."

Marcus told them. About finding Bruno abandoned near the zoo's perimeter fence. About the research he'd done on bear cub care. About the formula and the heating pad and the careful feeding schedule. His voice sounded hollow in his own ears, each word landing like a stone in the thick silence.

"You stole from a zoo," his mother said when he finished. "You've been lying to us for *weeks*."

"I didn't steal—he was going to die. They left him there."

"That's not how it works!" His father's control finally broke. He stood up, pacing to the window and back. "You don't just *take* things because you think you know better. There are people—professionals—who handle these situations."

"The professionals left him to die!"

"You don't know that!" His father's voice rose. "You're thirteen years old, Marcus. You don't know what you're talking about. That animal could have killed you. Could have killed your mother. Do you understand the danger you put this family in?"

Marcus's throat tightened. "He wouldn't hurt anyone. He's just a baby."

"A baby bear is still a bear." His mother moved to stand beside his father, presenting a united front. "What were you thinking? What was your plan—to keep it forever? To hide a *bear* in our garage until it was full-grown?"

"I was thinking someone had to care!" The words burst out of Marcus before he could stop them. "Someone had to notice he existed!"

The silence that followed felt like a physical thing, pressing down on all of them.

His father stared at him. "What?"

Marcus's eyes burned. He looked down at his hands, at the small scratches on his wrists from Bruno's claws during feeding time. "Nothing. Forget it."

"No." His father's voice had changed, some of the anger draining away. "What did you mean by that?"

"I just—" Marcus's voice cracked. "He was all alone. Nobody saw him. Nobody cared that he was there, dying in the dirt. And I couldn't just—I couldn't just walk away."

His mother's expression shifted, confusion replacing some of the fear. "Marcus—"

"I'm sorry," Marcus said, the words tumbling out now. "I know it was wrong. I know I should have told someone. But he would have died, and nobody would have even known. Nobody would have cared."

"We would have cared," his father said quietly. "If you'd told us—"

"When?" The question came out sharper than Marcus intended. "When would I have told you? At dinner, which we haven't eaten together in three weeks? Or maybe when you got home at nine o'clock last night? Or the night before, when you didn't get home at all?"

His father flinched like he'd been slapped.

"Marcus," his mother said, her voice softer now but still strained. "That's not fair."

"Isn't it?" Marcus felt tears sliding down his cheeks now, hot and shameful. "I did my research. I was careful. I fed him every four hours. I kept him warm and safe. I *took care* of him."

"By lying to us," his mother said. "By sneaking around. By putting yourself in danger."

"I know." Marcus wiped his face with his sleeve. "I know it was wrong. But he's alive. Doesn't that count for something?"

His father sat back down, heavily, like someone had cut his strings. He looked older suddenly, the lines around his eyes deeper in the lamplight. Outside, the streetlights flickered on, casting long shadows across the carpet.

"You're grounded," his father said finally. "Indefinitely. No phone, no computer except for homework. You'll come straight home from school."

Marcus nodded. He'd expected as much.

"And tomorrow," his mother added, her voice still shaking, "you're calling the zoo. You're going to apologize and explain what happened. And then we're returning that animal to where it belongs."

The words hit Marcus like a punch to the chest. He'd known this was coming—had known from the moment his mother screamed in the garage—but hearing it said out loud made it real in a way that stole his breath.

"Can I—" His voice broke. "Can I say goodbye?"

His parents exchanged a long look. His mother's eyes were red-rimmed, her mascara smudged. His father's shoulders sagged with exhaustion.

"Tomorrow," his father said. "After we call the zoo. After we figure out what happens next."

Marcus nodded, not trusting himself to speak.

"Go to your room," his mother said. "We need to talk. And Marcus—" She waited until he looked at her. "We're glad you're safe. We're glad nothing happened to you. But this—this can't happen again. Do you understand?"

"Yes, ma'am."

Marcus climbed the stairs to his room, each step feeling like it took all his strength. Behind him, he heard his parents' voices, low and urgent. His father said something about calling animal control. His mother mentioned insurance, liability.

In his room, Marcus lay on his bed and stared at the ceiling. Through the floor, he could hear Bruno's soft grunting from the garage below. The sound that had become so familiar, so comforting over the past weeks.

Tomorrow, it would be gone.

Tomorrow, he would have to let go.

But tonight, through the heating vents, he could still hear Bruno breathing. Still know that the cub was warm and fed and safe.

For one more night, at least, neither of them was alone.

**Scene 3: Late that night, Marcus's fath...**

**Scene 3: Late that night, Marcus's father comes to his room**

Marcus lay in the dark, staring at the glow-in-the-dark stars he'd stuck to his ceiling three years ago. Most had lost their luminescence, leaving only faint ghosts of constellations that didn't quite exist. His eyes burned from crying, but the tears had finally stopped. His throat felt raw, like he'd swallowed sandpaper.

The house was silent except for the occasional creak of settling wood and the distant hum of the refrigerator. His mother had gone to bed an hour ago, her footsteps heavy on the stairs. Marcus had heard her pause outside his door, heard the soft intake of breath like she might knock, but then she'd moved on.

He didn't blame her for being scared. The look on her face when she'd stumbled backward from the garage, dropping the photo albums—he'd never forget that. Not anger. Pure terror.

A soft knock broke the silence.

Marcus didn't answer. He pulled his comforter higher, turning toward the wall.

The door opened anyway, and a wedge of hallway light fell across his floor. His father's silhouette filled the doorway, broader than Marcus remembered. When had he last really looked at his dad?

"Can I come in?"

Marcus shrugged, even though his father probably couldn't see it in the darkness.

His father entered, closing the door behind him. The mattress dipped as he sat on the edge of Marcus's bed, and Marcus caught the familiar scent of coffee and the faint chemical smell of the print shop that always clung to his father's clothes, no matter how many times they were washed.

They sat in silence. Marcus counted his heartbeats—twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five—waiting for the lecture, the disappointment, the inevitable "What were you thinking?"

Instead, his father said, "I saw the setup you built. In the garage."

Marcus's chest tightened. "I know it was stupid."

"That's not what I was going to say." His father's voice was quiet, thoughtful. "The heating lamp was positioned at exactly the right height. You researched the proper temperature range, didn't you? And the feeding schedule on the wall—every three hours. Even through the night."

Marcus blinked in the darkness, confused. "Dad—"

"You built him a climbing structure from those old shelves. Added padding to all the sharp corners." His father paused. "When did you sleep?"

"I... I didn't. Not much." Marcus's voice cracked. "I had to make sure he was okay. He was so small when I found him, and he was crying, and nobody was coming for him, and—" The words tumbled out faster now, pressure building behind them like water against a dam. "I know it was wrong. I know I should have called someone right away. But Dad, he needed me. Someone needed me."

The last words came out as barely a whisper.

His father was quiet for a long moment. Then: "Turn on your lamp."

Marcus hesitated before reaching over and clicking on the small reading light beside his bed. Warm yellow light filled the space between them, and for the first time, Marcus saw his father's face. Really saw it.

His dad looked tired. Not just end-of-day tired, but bone-deep exhausted. There were new lines around his eyes that Marcus didn't remember, gray threading through his dark hair at the temples. But it was his expression that made Marcus's throat tighten—raw and open, like he'd taken off armor he'd been wearing for years.

"Tell me about feeling invisible," his father said.

Marcus's breath caught. "What?"

"You said someone needed you. Like you didn't think..." His father's jaw worked, searching for words. "Like you didn't think anyone here did."

"I didn't mean—" Marcus started, but his father held up a hand.

"Please. I need you to be honest with me. I'm listening. Really listening."

Something in Marcus's chest cracked open. All the words he'd been swallowing for months—years maybe—suddenly pressed against his lips, demanding release.

"You're never here," Marcus said, and his voice shook. "I know you're working. I know you're trying to keep the print shop going and you're stressed about money and Mom's worried all the time. I know all that. But Dad, I'm here too. I'm right here, and it's like..." He gestured helplessly at his fading stars. "It's like I'm disappearing. Like I'm becoming see-through."

His father's face crumpled, just for a second, before he steadied himself.

"At school, I'm just Marcus-who-doesn't-talk. At home, I'm just the kid who's fine, who doesn't need anything, who can take care of himself." Marcus's hands twisted in his comforter. "And then I found Bruno, and he was so helpless, and when I held him, he looked at me like I was the most important person in the world. Like I mattered. Like if I disappeared, it would actually mean something to someone."

"Marcus—"

"I know it was selfish!" The words burst out louder than Marcus intended. "I know I put him in danger by keeping him. I know I scared Mom and broke about a million laws and probably traumatized a baby bear because I was too stupid and selfish to do the right thing. But for three days, Dad, for three days I felt like I had a purpose. Like someone needed me to show up. To be there. To not disappear."

Tears were streaming down Marcus's face now, hot and fast. His father reached out, and Marcus thought he might ruffle his hair or pat his shoulder—the distant, awkward gestures he'd grown used to. Instead, his father pulled him into a fierce hug, arms tight around Marcus's shoulders.

"I'm sorry," his father said, voice thick. "God, Marcus, I'm so sorry."

Marcus froze, then collapsed into the embrace, sobbing into his father's shoulder. His father held him tighter, one hand cupping the back of Marcus's head like he was something precious and breakable.

"I thought I was doing the right thing," his father said. "Working extra hours, taking on more clients. Trying to provide. But I was so focused on giving you things—a house, food, stability—that I forgot to give you me. I forgot to show up."

"I don't need things," Marcus choked out. "I just need you to see me."

"I see you." His father pulled back just enough to look Marcus in the eyes. His own eyes were red-rimmed, wet. "I see you, son. And I'm sorry it took a bear in our garage for me to realize I'd been looking right through you."

They sat there in the small circle of lamplight, the house quiet around them. Marcus's breathing gradually steadied, his father's hand still resting on his shoulder.

"What you did for Bruno," his father said finally, "keeping him alive, caring for him around the clock—that took real dedication. Real love." He paused. "But you know we can't keep him."

Marcus nodded, fresh tears threatening. "I know. He deserves better than a garage. Better than me."

"No." His father's voice was firm. "He deserves what's best for him. And so do you. That's not the same as saying you're not enough." He squeezed Marcus's shoulder. "What if we could find a way to do right by Bruno and by you? What if we worked on this together?"

Marcus looked up, hope flickering in his chest like a candle in the wind. "Together?"

"Together." His father stood, moving to Marcus's desk and opening the laptop there. The screen's blue glow joined the lamplight. "I did some research after dinner. There are wildlife sanctuaries that specialize in orphaned bears. Places where Bruno could get proper medical care and eventually live with other bears in a natural habitat."

"Really?" Marcus scrambled off the bed to stand beside his father.

"Really." His father pulled up a website showing sprawling forested enclosures and rehabilitation facilities. "It's not a quick fix. We still have to apologize to the zoo, face whatever consequences come from this. And Bruno still has to leave. But maybe..." He looked at Marcus. "Maybe we can make sure he goes somewhere that gives him the best possible life. And maybe you could be part of that process."

Marcus stared at the screen, at the images of bears climbing trees and splashing in streams. It wasn't keeping Bruno. It wasn't the fantasy he'd built in his head of somehow making this work. But it was something real. Something better.

"Can we call them tomorrow?" Marcus asked.

"First thing in the morning." His father closed the laptop and turned to

**Scene 4: Marcus, his father, and zoo of...**

# **Scene 4: Marcus, his father, and zoo officials meet at the house to discuss Bruno's future**

The dining room had never felt so formal. Mom had cleared the table of its usual clutter—the stack of unread magazines, Dad's laptop, the basket of mail—and set out a pitcher of water with actual glasses instead of their everyday plastic cups. Marcus sat between his parents, his hands folded in his lap, still wearing the same clothes from yesterday. He hadn't slept.

Through the window, he could see the garage. Bruno was in there, sedated by the veterinarian who'd come last night. Safe. Sleeping. For now.

The doorbell rang, and Marcus's stomach dropped.

"I'll get it," Dad said, squeezing Marcus's shoulder as he stood.

Marcus listened to the murmur of voices in the hallway—his father's low rumble, a woman's professional tone, a man's softer response. Then they appeared in the doorway: a woman in her forties with kind eyes and graying hair pulled back in a practical bun, and a younger man carrying a tablet and a leather portfolio.

"Marcus, this is Dr. Chen, the zoo's head veterinarian," Dad said, gesturing to the woman. "And Mr. Rodriguez, the director of animal welfare."

"Hello, Marcus." Dr. Chen's voice was warm but serious as she took a seat across from him. Mr. Rodriguez sat beside her, placing his portfolio on the table with a soft thump that made Marcus flinch.

"Thank you for meeting with us," Mom said, her voice tight. She'd been crying on and off since yesterday, and her eyes were still red-rimmed.

Dr. Chen poured herself a glass of water, the liquid catching the morning light streaming through the window. "Before we begin, I want to say something." She looked directly at Marcus. "What you did was dangerous and illegal. You put yourself, your family, and the cub at risk."

Marcus nodded, unable to meet her eyes.

"But," she continued, and something in her tone made him look up, "in my twenty years working with animals, I've rarely seen a wild animal in unauthorized care look as healthy as Bruno does. You clearly researched his needs. You kept him clean, well-fed, and from what I can tell, relatively stress-free."

Marcus felt his throat tighten. "I tried. I just—I wanted him to be okay."

"He is okay," Mr. Rodriguez said, opening his portfolio. "Which is why we're here to discuss options rather than simply reclaiming him."

Options. The word hung in the air like a lifeline.

Dad leaned forward. "Marcus and I did some research last night. We found information about wildlife rehabilitation sanctuaries that specialize in orphaned bears."

Dr. Chen's eyebrows rose. "You're thinking of the Northern Wildlife Sanctuary?"

"Yes," Marcus said, his voice cracking with sudden hope. "They have a program for cubs who can't be released into the wild. They—they live in natural habitats with other bears. They get proper medical care and—"

"And they're not in cages," Mr. Rodriguez finished gently. "I know the sanctuary well. We've worked with them before."

Marcus's heart hammered against his ribs. "Could Bruno go there? Instead of back to the zoo?"

Dr. Chen and Mr. Rodriguez exchanged a look that Marcus couldn't quite read. The silence stretched out, broken only by the ticking of the wall clock and the distant hum of the refrigerator.

"The zoo's bear exhibit is designed for adult bears," Dr. Chen said finally. "Bruno's mother was pregnant when she arrived, and we weren't prepared for a cub. Our facilities aren't ideal for raising an orphaned bear to maturity."

"The sanctuary would be better," Mr. Rodriguez added. "But there are protocols. Paperwork. The sanctuary would need to accept him, and there are costs involved."

"We'll pay," Dad said immediately. "Whatever it takes."

Mom reached across the table and grabbed Dad's hand. "We will," she agreed, her voice thick with emotion.

Mr. Rodriguez pulled out his tablet and began typing. "Let me contact the sanctuary director. If they have space in their cub program, and if Dr. Chen clears Bruno medically for transport, we could potentially arrange a transfer within the week."

Within the week. Marcus felt dizzy with the speed of it all. Yesterday, Bruno had been his secret. Today, people were discussing his future like adults planning something important. Something real.

"Marcus," Dr. Chen said, pulling his attention back. "If this works out, the sanctuary has a volunteer program for young people. You'd need to complete their training, follow their rules, and understand that Bruno will become wilder as he bonds with other cubs. But you could visit. Help with his care."

"Really?" The word came out as barely a whisper.

"Really." She smiled, and it softened her whole face. "You made a mistake, but you also showed remarkable dedication. The sanctuary values that kind of commitment."

Marcus looked at his father, who was watching him with an expression Marcus had never seen before—something like pride mixed with sadness and understanding.

"There's one condition," Mr. Rodriguez said, his tone becoming more serious. "You'll need to complete a youth education program about wildlife conservation and why wild animals can't be pets. And you'll have community service hours at the zoo, helping us educate other kids about proper animal care."

"I'll do it," Marcus said immediately. "Anything. I just—I want what's best for Bruno."

"Then we're in agreement." Mr. Rodriguez closed his portfolio. "I'll make the calls this afternoon. Dr. Chen will examine Bruno again and prepare the medical documentation. Marcus, you and your parents should visit the sanctuary's website, read about their program, and prepare yourselves for what this transition will look like."

Dr. Chen stood, and everyone else followed. "One more thing, Marcus. When it's time to transport Bruno, you can come along. You can help settle him into his new home. But after that, the sanctuary staff will take over his primary care. You understand?"

Marcus nodded, his eyes burning with unshed tears. "I understand. He needs to be with other bears. He needs to be wild."

"He does," Dr. Chen agreed softly. "But that doesn't mean you didn't love him. It means you loved him enough to want what's right for him."

After the zoo officials left, Marcus sat at the dining room table while his parents cleaned up the water glasses. Through the window, the garage stood silent in the morning sun. Inside, Bruno was sleeping, unaware that his whole world was about to change again.

But this time, Marcus thought, it would change for the better. This time, Bruno would have space to run, other bears to play with, and people who knew how to help him grow into what he was meant to be.

"Marcus," Dad said, sitting back down beside him. "I'm proud of you."

Marcus looked at his father, surprised. "For stealing a bear cub?"

"For loving something enough to let it go." Dad's voice was rough with emotion. "That takes real courage."

Mom sat down on Marcus's other side and wrapped her arm around his shoulders. "We're going to get through this together," she said. "All of us."

For the first time since his mother had screamed in the garage yesterday, Marcus felt like he could breathe. Bruno would be okay. He would be okay. And maybe, just maybe, his family would be okay too.

Outside, a bird sang in the maple tree, and somewhere in the garage, a bear cub dreamed of forests he'd never seen but would soon call home.

The carrier rattled softly in the back of Dad's truck as they turned onto the gravel road. Marcus sat twisted in his seat, one hand pressed against the rear window, watching Bruno's dark shape shift behind the ventilation slots.

"He's okay," Dad said quietly. "We're almost there."

Marcus nodded but didn't turn around. His throat felt tight, had felt tight since they'd coaxed Bruno into the carrier two hours ago with pieces of apple and peanut butter. Bruno had gone willingly, trusting, and that somehow made everything worse.

The Wildwood Wildlife Rehabilitation Sanctuary appeared gradually through the trees—first a weathered wooden sign, then a sprawling property with multiple buildings connected by covered walkways. Nothing like the concrete and steel of the zoo. Here, everything seemed designed to blend into the forest surrounding it.

A woman with silver-streaked hair pulled back in a braid stood waiting in the parking area. She wore cargo pants and a fleece jacket with the sanctuary logo, and when she smiled, the lines around her eyes deepened.

"You must be Marcus," she said, extending her hand. "I'm Sarah. Welcome to Wildwood."

Marcus shook her hand, surprised by the firmness of her grip. Behind her, another figure emerged from one of the buildings—Jade, the veterinary tech from the zoo. She'd changed out of her uniform into jeans and a flannel shirt, but her expression was the same mixture of kindness and professional concern.

"Hey, Marcus," Jade said. "Thought you might like a familiar face today."

Something loosened in Marcus's chest. "You work here too?"

"Volunteer on weekends. This is where I spend most of my free time, actually." She gestured toward the carrier. "How's our patient doing?"

Together, they unloaded Bruno. Dad and Sarah carried the front handles while Marcus and Jade took the rear. Bruno made a soft huffing sound, and Marcus could see one dark paw pressed against the carrier's side.

"Easy, little one," Sarah murmured. "Almost home."

They carried him past the main building into a climate-controlled nursery that smelled of fresh hay and something sweet Marcus couldn't identify. Soft classical music played from hidden speakers. Three other enclosures lined the walls, each one spacious and filled with climbing structures, toys, and comfortable bedding.

In the far enclosure, two bear cubs wrestled over a rubber ball, tumbling over each other in a tangle of brown fur. They were slightly larger than Bruno, healthier-looking, their coats glossy under the warm lights.

"Those are Maple and Birch," Sarah explained as they set Bruno's carrier down. "Sisters. Found them last spring after their mother was hit by a car. They'll be Bruno's neighbors for a while, until he's strong enough to join them."

Marcus watched the cubs play, something aching in his chest. He'd never been able to give Bruno this—other bears, space to run, proper care.

Sarah opened the carrier door carefully, stepping back to give Bruno room. For a long moment, nothing happened. Then Bruno's black nose appeared, sniffing cautiously. He emerged slowly, limping slightly on his injured leg, eyes wide and uncertain.

The room went silent except for the music and the soft sounds of Maple and Birch playing. Bruno took three tentative steps, then stopped, turning back toward the carrier—toward Marcus.

"It's okay," Marcus whispered, kneeling down. His voice cracked. "It's okay, Bruno."

Bruno made a sound Marcus had never heard before, somewhere between a whimper and a question. The other cubs stopped playing, pressing against their enclosure wall to watch the newcomer.

Jade crouched beside Marcus. "See those two? They were just like Bruno when they arrived. Scared, hurt, not sure if they'd ever feel safe again." She pointed to where Maple had her paw on Birch's back, the two of them watching with curious eyes. "Now look at them."

Bruno took another step forward, then another. He approached a water bowl, sniffed it, then drank deeply. When he finished, he looked around the enclosure with what Marcus could only describe as wonder—at the climbing log, the pile of enrichment toys, the soft bedding in the corner.

"He's already exploring," Sarah said softly. "That's a very good sign."

Dad's hand settled on Marcus's shoulder. "You kept him alive long enough to get here. That's what matters."

Marcus swallowed hard. "I should have brought him sooner."

"Maybe," Sarah said, coming to stand beside them. "But you brought him eventually. That took courage, Marcus. And love." She gestured to the enclosure. "Most people who find wild animals either ignore them or try to keep them forever. You chose the harder path—the right one."

Bruno discovered a rubber Kong toy filled with frozen fruit. He batted at it experimentally, then jumped back when it rolled. Maple made an encouraging sound, and Bruno tried again, this time managing to extract a piece of apple. His tail—Marcus hadn't even realized bears had tails until now—gave a tiny wag.

"Can I..." Marcus's voice came out rough. "Can I go in? Just for a minute?"

Sarah considered this. "Normally, we limit human contact. We want them to be bears, not pets." She saw Marcus's face fall and continued, "But just this once, for a few minutes. He knows you. It might help him settle."

She opened the enclosure door, and Marcus stepped inside. Bruno looked up from his toy, recognition immediate. He ambled over, making his familiar chirping sound, and pressed his head against Marcus's leg.

Marcus sank down, wrapping his arms around Bruno's warm bulk one last time. The cub smelled different already—less like the garage, more like hay and the antiseptic cleanliness of the sanctuary. Bruno licked Marcus's hand, then his face, just like he used to do in those quiet moments when it was just the two of them.

"You're going to be okay," Marcus whispered into Bruno's fur. "Better than okay. You're going to have friends and space to run and people who actually know what they're doing." His voice broke. "You're going to be happy."

Bruno pulled back, looking at Marcus with those dark, intelligent eyes. Then he did something unexpected—he touched his nose to Marcus's nose, gentle and deliberate, before turning away toward the toys scattered across the enclosure floor.

Not a goodbye. Just an acknowledgment.

Marcus stayed there for another minute, watching Bruno investigate his new home. When he finally stood and stepped out of the enclosure, his cheeks were wet, but his chest didn't feel quite as tight.

"He's going to do great here," Jade said, standing beside him as Sarah secured the door. "I've seen dozens of cubs come through. Bruno's a fighter—you could tell that from the start."

"Would you like to see the rest of the facility?" Sarah asked. "The outdoor habitats where he'll eventually move?"

Marcus nodded, not trusting his voice.

They walked through the sanctuary grounds, Sarah explaining the rehabilitation process. The outdoor enclosures were massive—acres of natural forest enclosed by invisible fencing, with dens and climbing trees and even small ponds. In one, Marcus saw three adolescent bears lounging in the shade, looking wild and healthy and completely unlike the fragile cub he'd found in his garage.

"That's the goal," Sarah said. "By next spring, if all goes well, Bruno will be in one of these habitats. And eventually, when he's old enough and strong enough, we'll release him into a protected wilderness area where he can live as a wild bear should."

"Will he remember me?" Marcus asked quietly.

Sarah's expression softened. "Probably not, in the way you mean. Bears don't form attachments like dogs or cats. But does that make what you did for him any less important?" She shook her head. "You saved his life, Marcus. You gave him a chance at the future he was meant to have. That matters, whether he remembers or not."

They returned to the nursery building as afternoon light slanted through the windows. Through the viewing glass, Marcus could see Bruno curled up in the soft bedding, the Kong toy tucked against his chest. He looked small and peaceful and, for the first time since Marcus had found him, truly safe.

Maple and Birch had settled down too, watching their new neighbor with drowsy interest.

"We should probably head out," Dad said gently. "Let him rest."

Marcus pressed his hand against the glass. Bruno's chest rose and fell with deep, even breaths.

"There's a volunteer orientation next

**Scene 6: In their final close interaction**

The transition enclosure smelled of fresh pine shavings and wild grass, nothing like the garage with its oil stains and forgotten garden tools. Marcus knelt in the soft dirt, his jeans already muddy at the knees, watching Bruno investigate a hollow log for the third time that morning.

"He's ready," Sarah, the sanctuary director, said quietly from the doorway. "The other cubs have been asking about him all week."

Marcus nodded, not trusting his voice. Through the chain-link fence beyond the enclosure, he could see the outdoor habitat—acres of forest and stream where three other orphaned cubs tumbled and wrestled in the dappled sunlight. Bruno's new family.

Bruno abandoned the log and lumbered over, bigger now than Marcus remembered from just two weeks ago. The cub's coat had grown thick and glossy from proper nutrition. His eyes were bright, alert, wild in a way they'd never been in the garage. He was becoming what he was always meant to be.

"Hey, buddy," Marcus whispered, running his hand along Bruno's back one last time. The cub made a soft huffing sound and nosed at Marcus's pocket, looking for the apple slices he'd brought every visit.

Marcus pulled out the last piece, holding it flat on his palm the way Sarah had taught him. Bruno's rough tongue tickled his skin as the cub took it, crunching contentedly. Beyond the fence, one of the other cubs let out a playful bellow.

Bruno's ears perked up. His whole body tensed with interest.

"You hear them?" Marcus's throat felt tight. "That's your real family out there. Bears who can teach you things I never could."

Bruno looked at him, then back toward the sound of the other cubs. His tail twitched with barely contained excitement.

Marcus wrapped his arms around the cub's neck, breathing in the scent of him—earth and honey and something indefinably wild. "I'm sorry I kept you in that garage. I thought... I thought if I could just take care of you, if I could be good enough at it, then maybe I'd matter. But you were never supposed to be mine."

His father stood outside the enclosure, hands in his pockets, giving Marcus this moment. They'd driven here together every weekend for a month now, sometimes talking, sometimes just sitting in comfortable silence. Yesterday, his dad had asked if Marcus wanted to join his recreational basketball league. Not because Marcus had to, but because his father wanted to spend time with him.

"I love you," Marcus whispered into Bruno's fur. "I love you enough to let you go."

Sarah opened the gate that led to the outdoor habitat. The sound of the latch clicking made Bruno's head snap up.

"Whenever you're ready," she said gently.

Marcus pulled back, his hands trembling as he cupped Bruno's face one last time. The cub's dark eyes met his, and for a moment, Marcus could have sworn Bruno understood. Then the cub licked his cheek—one quick, rough swipe—and turned toward the open gate.

Bruno didn't hesitate. Didn't look back. He bounded through the opening with a joyful grunt, his powerful legs carrying him toward the forest, toward the stream, toward the three cubs who stopped their playing to watch him approach.

Marcus stood slowly, his legs unsteady, watching as Bruno crashed into the group. Within seconds, they were wrestling, tumbling, being bears in a way that made Marcus's chest ache with both sadness and something lighter. Something like relief.

"You did good, kiddo," his father said, appearing beside him. His hand settled on Marcus's shoulder, warm and solid.

"It hurts," Marcus admitted, swiping at his eyes.

"Yeah. That's how you know it was real."

They watched together as Bruno chased another cub into the stream, sending up sprays of crystal water that caught the afternoon light. The cub was already smaller among the trees, already becoming part of something bigger than the space Marcus had tried to keep him in.

"Can we come back next weekend?" Marcus asked.

His father squeezed his shoulder. "Every weekend you want. For as long as you need."

Bruno disappeared into the forest with the other cubs, their playful sounds echoing back through the trees. Marcus pressed his fingers against the fence, feeling the cool metal against his skin, grounding himself in this moment—this painful, beautiful, necessary goodbye.

"I see you," he whispered, not sure if he was talking to Bruno or to himself. "I see you, and you're going to be okay."

Behind him, Sarah was already preparing the enclosure for the next arrival—another cub who would need temporary care before finding its way back to the wild. Another chance to help, to connect, to matter in a way that wasn't about holding on but about knowing when to let go.

Marcus took one last look at the forest where Bruno had vanished, then turned toward his father. "I'm ready."

They walked back to the car together, the afternoon sun warm on their backs, and for the first time in longer than Marcus could remember, he didn't feel invisible at all.
