## Chapter 7: Crossing Lines

**Scene 1: Max contacts Mariana through a...**

**Scene 1: Max contacts Mariana through an encrypted messaging app**

The afternoon light filtered through the shutters of Max's apartment, casting prison-bar shadows across the hardwood floor. He sat at the kitchen table, his laptop open before him, the cursor blinking in the message field like a patient interrogator waiting for a confession.

Three days had passed since the gallery opening. Three days of surveillance photos, background checks, and encrypted reports to Langley. Three days of telling himself this was just another operation.

Max flexed his fingers, then began typing on the secure messaging app he'd used to exchange contact information with Mariana that night.

*I hope this message finds you well. I've been thinking about our conversation regarding emerging markets and strategic positioning.*

He paused, reading it back. Too formal. Too obvious. He deleted the last sentence.

*I hope this message finds you well. Dmitri Vershinsky mentioned he's considering a tech acquisition in the biotech sector—something about AI-driven pharmaceutical development. Given your background, I thought you might be interested in discussing the opportunity over dinner.*

Better. Professional distance with just enough bait. Vershinsky's name would intrigue her, and the biotech angle aligned perfectly with her known interests. Max added one more line:

*I know a place in the Gothic Quarter. Thursday evening, if you're available?*

His finger hovered over the send button. The apartment was silent except for the distant hum of Barcelona traffic and the rhythmic ticking of the vintage clock on the wall—a relic left by the previous tenant that Max had never bothered to remove.

He thought of Elena's warning during their last encrypted call: *"Don't get close to her, Max. These people aren't like us. They don't have lines they won't cross."*

But getting close was exactly what the mission required.

He pressed send.

The message showed as delivered immediately, then read thirty seconds later. Max's pulse quickened despite himself. He stood, walking to the window, watching the street below where a vendor was closing up his flower stand for the day. An elderly woman argued with him about the price of roses, her hands gesturing emphatically.

His phone remained silent.

Max made coffee, the espresso machine hissing and gurgling. He checked his secure email—routine intelligence reports, nothing urgent. Checked the message app again. Still nothing.

She was making him wait. Of course she was. Mariana Alvidrez hadn't survived in her world by appearing eager or available. Every interaction was a negotiation, every response calibrated for maximum advantage.

Two hours crawled by. Max reviewed surveillance footage from the gallery, watching Mariana's movements frame by frame. The way she'd touched his arm when she laughed. The momentary hardness in her eyes when Vershinsky had mentioned China. The careful distance she'd maintained from certain guests while gravitating toward others.

His phone vibrated at 7:47 PM.

*Thursday works. There's a place called El Quatre Gats—do you know it? 8:30?*

Max smiled despite himself. She'd countered his suggestion with her own, reclaiming control of the situation. El Quatre Gats—the Four Cats—a restaurant famous for its modernist history, where Picasso had once held his first exhibition. Public enough to be safe, intimate enough to talk.

Smart.

He typed back: *Perfect. I'll make a reservation.*

Her response came quickly this time: *Already done. See you Thursday, Max.*

He set the phone down and leaned back in his chair, staring at the ceiling. The water-stained plaster formed patterns that reminded him of topographical maps—territories to be navigated, borders to be crossed.

Thursday was two days away. Forty-eight hours to prepare the phone-cloning device, to memorize her recent travel patterns, to construct the perfect cover story about Vershinsky's supposed acquisition interests. Forty-eight hours to convince himself that the anticipation tightening in his chest was purely professional.

Outside, the Barcelona evening deepened into night. The flower vendor was gone, the roses sold or discarded. Max closed his laptop and walked to the kitchen, pouring the now-cold coffee down the sink.

He had crossed a line by sending that message, transforming passive surveillance into active manipulation. There would be other lines to cross in the coming days—some he could see clearly, others still hidden in the shadows of what this operation might demand.

The clock on the wall ticked steadily forward, counting down to Thursday, indifferent to the weight of the choices being made in its presence.

**Scene 2: Max arrives early at the intim...**

**Scene 2: Max arrives early at the intimate restaurant**

The stone archway of Can Culleretes seemed to absorb the evening light rather than reflect it. Max ducked through the entrance twenty minutes before their agreed meeting time, his eyes adjusting to the amber glow of wrought-iron chandeliers that had illuminated this space since 1786. The restaurant occupied the ground floor of a medieval building, its walls thick enough to muffle the tourist chatter from the Carrer d'En Quintana outside.

He chose a table near the back, positioned so he could watch both the entrance and the narrow hallway leading to the kitchen. The waiter, an older man with the practiced efficiency of someone who'd served thousands of meals in this exact spot, brought water and a wine list without being asked.

Max ordered a bottle of Priorat and checked his watch. The device in his jacket pocket—no larger than a credit card—felt heavier than its actual weight. Langley's latest toy: a wireless cloning tool that could mirror a smartphone's contents in under ninety seconds if positioned within two feet of the target device. He'd practiced the deployment a dozen times in his hotel room, timing the motion until it became muscle memory.

The wine arrived. He took a measured sip, letting the dark fruit and mineral notes ground him in the moment. This was just another operation. Another asset to cultivate. The fact that his pulse had quickened when he'd seen her name in his text messages this afternoon meant nothing.

Mariana appeared in the archway at precisely eight o'clock.

She wore a charcoal dress that ended just above the knee, elegant without being formal, paired with low heels that acknowledged Barcelona's cobblestones. Her dark hair was pulled back, revealing the clean line of her jaw and the silver earrings that caught the candlelight. She scanned the room with the same careful attention he'd noticed at the gala, her gaze pausing fractionally on each occupied table before finding him.

Max stood as she approached. "You're exactly on time."

"I'm usually five minutes early." She accepted his offered hand, her grip firm and brief. "But I got caught behind a tour group at the cathedral."

"The hazards of the Gothic Quarter." He pulled out her chair. "I hope you don't mind that I ordered wine. The Priorat here is excellent."

"I trust your judgment." She settled into her seat, placing a small leather clutch on the table beside her plate. Her phone, he noted, would be inside it. "Though I'm curious how you found this place. It's not exactly on the tourist circuit."

"A friend recommended it." The lie came easily. He'd spent an hour yesterday afternoon researching restaurants that offered the right combination of intimacy and distraction. "Someone who appreciates history."

"The oldest restaurant in Barcelona." Mariana accepted the wine he poured, her fingers briefly touching his as she steadied the glass. "My grandmother used to bring me here when I was young. She'd tell me stories about the Civil War, about people who met in places like this to plan, to conspire, to fall in love." She raised her glass. "To old stones and new possibilities."

They drank. Max felt the weight of her attention, the way she observed him over the rim of her glass. He'd been studied before—interrogated, even—but this felt different. More personal.

"So," she said, setting down her glass. "Tell me about Vershinsky's interests in the medical technology sector."

And there it was. Straight to business, no pretense about this being anything other than what he'd framed it as. Max felt a flicker of respect.

"He's been watching the convergence of AI and diagnostics," Max said, falling into the role he'd prepared. "Particularly companies working on predictive algorithms for disease progression. The kind of technology that could revolutionize treatment protocols."

"Or revolutionize insurance underwriting." Mariana's tone was neutral, but her eyes sharpened. "Predictive algorithms cut both ways."

"They do." He leaned back slightly, letting the acknowledgment sit between them. "Which is why he's interested in companies with strong ethical frameworks. Ones that understand the difference between progress and exploitation."

"And you believe such companies exist?" She broke off a piece of bread, her movements unhurried. "In my experience, Mr. Monroe, the pressure to monetize always wins. Ethics are expensive."

"Max," he corrected. "And yes, I believe they exist. Rare, perhaps. But they exist."

"Optimism from a venture capitalist." A hint of a smile. "That's refreshing."

The waiter appeared to take their orders. Mariana chose the grilled octopus and hake in green sauce. Max ordered the same, using the interruption to study her more closely. The way she held herself, the controlled grace of her gestures—it spoke of discipline, of someone accustomed to being watched and evaluated.

When they were alone again, she turned the conversation. "Tell me about yourself, Max. Beyond the portfolio and the pitches. What brought you to this work?"

The question landed like a chess move—casual on the surface, strategic underneath. Max recognized the shift from professional to personal, the subtle probe for vulnerabilities or inconsistencies in his cover.

"I grew up believing in systems," he said, threading truth into the fiction. "That if you understood how things worked, you could make them better. Venture capital seemed like a way to do that at scale."

"And does it? Make things better?"

"Sometimes." He met her gaze directly. "Sometimes you're just moving money around and telling yourself it matters."

Something flickered in her expression—recognition, perhaps, or appreciation for the honesty. "You sound disillusioned."

"I sound realistic." He poured more wine for both of them. "What about you? What brought a molecular biologist into the world of pharmaceutical development?"

"The same thing that brings anyone into this field." Her finger traced the rim of her glass. "The belief that we can heal what's broken. That science can be a form of justice."

"Justice is an interesting word choice."

"Is it?" She held his gaze, and Max felt the temperature of the conversation shift. "I think about it often. The justice of access to medicine. Of who gets to live and who gets to die based on geography or economics." She paused. "Don't you think about justice, Max? In your work?"

The question carried weight beyond its words. Max sensed the test embedded in it, the way she was measuring not just his answer but his reaction.

"I think about impact," he said carefully. "About whether the capital flowing through my hands does more good than harm."

"And does it?"

"I'd like to believe so."

"Belief." Mariana smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes. "Another expensive luxury."

Their food arrived, the octopus perfectly charred, the hake delicate in its pool of parsley-flecked sauce. They ate in companionable silence for a few moments, the intensity of the conversation easing into something more comfortable.

"This is excellent," Mariana said. "I haven't been here in years. Thank you for the reminder."

"Your grandmother would approve?"

"She would have approved of the food." Mariana's expression softened with memory. "The company, she would have had questions about."

"What kind of questions?"

"Whether you're the kind of man who says what he means." She looked at him directly. "Whether your intentions match your words."

Max felt the double edge of the statement, the way it applied to both of them. "And what would you tell her?"

"That I'm still deciding."

The waiter cleared their plates. Mariana excused herself to take a call, her phone already in her hand as she moved toward the hallway near the restrooms. Max watched her disappear around the corner, counting to five before his hand moved to his jacket pocket.

The cloning device activated with a pressure-sensitive switch. He placed it on the table beside her clutch, the proximity sensor engaging automatically. Ninety seconds. That's all he needed.

He sipped his wine and watched the archway, his expression relaxed while his pulse hammered against his ribs. Sixty seconds. The device worked silently, its LED hidden from view. Forty-five seconds.

Mariana's laugh drifted from the hallway, warm and genuine. Whoever she was talking to, the conversation pleased her. Thirty seconds.

Max's phone buzzed—a text from an unknown number. His blood went cold.

```
Nice try.
```

He looked up sharply. Mariana stood in the archway, phone still pressed to her ear, her eyes locked on his. She smiled, said something into the phone, and ended the call.

She walked back to the table with the same measured grace, but everything between them had changed. She

**Scene 3: The conversation shifts from b...**

**Scene 3: The conversation shifts from business to personal territory**

The waiter cleared their appetizer plates with practiced efficiency, leaving behind a silence that felt deliberately constructed. Mariana broke it first, swirling the wine in her glass with a thoughtful expression.

"So tell me, Max," she said, her accent softening his name into something almost intimate. "What does a venture capitalist from Silicon Valley do for pleasure? When you're not hunting for the next unicorn?"

Max leaned back, aware of the shift in her approach. The business discussion had ended with the appetizers. Now came the real interrogation.

"I sail when I can," he said, pulling from his legend. "There's something honest about wind and water. No algorithms, no pitch decks."

"Honest." She tested the word like she was tasting something unfamiliar. "An interesting choice. Do you find your work dishonest?"

"I find it complicated." He met her eyes. "People tell you what they think you want to hear. Everyone's selling something."

"Including you?"

"Especially me."

A smile flickered across her lips—genuine this time, not the professional mask she'd worn earlier. The waiter arrived with their main courses: grilled octopus for her, black rice with squid ink for him. The plates were works of art, each element precisely positioned.

Mariana cut into her octopus with surgical precision. "And your family? Are they in technology as well?"

Here it was—the background check disguised as dinner conversation. Max had rehearsed this a hundred times, but delivering it to her, watching those dark eyes catalog every micro-expression, made his pulse quicken.

"My father was a professor. Literature. He died when I was sixteen." Truth, borrowed from another life, woven into the legend. "My mother remarried. We don't talk much."

"I'm sorry." She paused, and he couldn't tell if the sympathy was genuine or tactical. "Sixteen is a difficult age to lose a parent."

"It teaches you to rely on yourself." He took a bite of the rice, buying time. The squid ink was rich, almost metallic. "What about you? You've built something impressive with NeuralEth. That doesn't happen without sacrifice."

"Sacrifice." She set down her fork. "Another interesting word choice. You think success requires suffering?"

"I think it requires focus. Single-mindedness. The kind that makes relationships difficult."

"Is that your experience?"

The question landed like a probe, searching for weak points in his armor. Max wondered how much she already knew, what background checks her own people had run. His legend would hold—the Agency had made sure of that—but legends were built from facts arranged in careful lies. If she pulled the wrong thread...

"I was engaged once," he said, improvising carefully. "She wanted stability. I wanted to change the world. Those things don't always align."

Mariana studied him over the rim of her glass. The candlelight caught the amber flecks in her eyes, made them seem to shift and change like a heat mirage.

"And which did you choose?"

"I'm sitting in Barcelona on a Wednesday night, discussing neural interfaces with a brilliant CEO." He allowed himself a small smile. "What do you think?"

"I think you're very good at answering questions without revealing anything true."

The observation hit closer than he'd have liked. Max felt a bead of sweat form between his shoulder blades despite the restaurant's perfect climate control. She was better at this than his briefing had suggested—or perhaps she'd been underestimated. He was beginning to suspect the latter.

"Occupational hazard," he said. "In my world, information is currency. You learn to be careful."

"In mine as well." She leaned forward slightly, and he caught the scent of her perfume—something with jasmine and cedar. "But I find that the most interesting conversations happen when people take risks. When they say something true, even when it's dangerous."

"Is that an invitation or a test?"

"Perhaps both."

The waiter reappeared, refilling their water glasses, breaking the tension like a stone dropped into still water. When he left, Mariana's phone buzzed against the table. She glanced at it, and something shifted in her expression—a tightening around the eyes, a barely perceptible straightening of her spine.

"I apologize," she said, standing. "I need to take this. A situation in Manila that requires my attention."

"Of course."

He watched her weave through the tables toward the restaurant's entrance, phone already at her ear. Her posture had changed entirely—the warm dinner companion replaced by the CEO managing a crisis. Max counted to five, then reached into his jacket pocket.

The device was smaller than a credit card, disguised as a phone charger. CIA tech, the kind that didn't officially exist. He'd have maybe ninety seconds while she was outside, another thirty if she stepped further away for privacy.

His heart hammered as he stood, moving with casual purpose toward the coat check near the entrance. Through the window, he could see Mariana's back, her free hand gesturing as she spoke rapid-fire Spanish. He positioned himself where he could watch her while appearing to check his own phone.

Sixty seconds. The device needed proximity—within three feet of her phone when she returned. He'd have to time it perfectly.

Mariana turned, still talking, her expression unreadable. Max moved back toward their table, pulse racing, every nerve alive with the familiar cocktail of fear and focus that came with operational work. This was the moment where training met reality, where one wrong move could burn months of preparation.

She was walking back inside.

He sat down, the device palmed in his left hand, pressed against his thigh under the table. His right hand lifted his wine glass, the picture of relaxed patience.

Mariana returned to her seat, setting her phone face-down on the table between them. "I'm sorry about that. A server issue in one of our Asian facilities. Nothing that can't wait until morning, but my CTO is a worrier."

"The price of building something important," Max said. "People depend on you."

"Yes." Something in her voice had changed—a new weight, or perhaps a new wariness. She looked at him differently now, as if the phone call had reminded her of something. "Tell me, Max. When you make an investment, what matters more to you—the technology or the people behind it?"

The question felt loaded, significant in ways he couldn't immediately parse. He leaned forward to set down his wine glass, bringing his left hand to rest on the table's edge. The device was now inches from her phone.

"The people," he said. "Technology is just code and hardware. It's the vision behind it that changes the world. The willingness to push boundaries, to go where others won't."

"Even when those boundaries are ethical ones?"

There it was—the real question, sharp as a scalpel. Max felt the device vibrate once against his palm, so subtle only he would notice. The connection was made. He had maybe twenty seconds before it completed the clone.

"Ethics are complicated in innovation," he said carefully. "What seems dangerous today might save millions tomorrow. Penicillin was controversial. Vaccines were blasphemy. Every breakthrough requires someone willing to take the first step."

"And if that step harms people?"

Fifteen seconds.

"Then you have a responsibility to make it right. But you don't stop walking forward."

Mariana's eyes searched his face, looking for something he couldn't name. The moment stretched between them, intimate and dangerous, until he felt the device vibrate twice. Complete.

"You sound very certain," she said softly. "I wonder if you've ever had to make that choice. To decide whether the end justifies the means."

Max thought of Kabul, of Jakarta, of a dozen operations where the math of lives saved versus lives spent had kept him awake until dawn. He thought of the device in his hand, the violation of trust it represented, and the greater good it supposedly served.

"Every day," he said, and meant it.

Something shifted in Mariana's expression—recognition, perhaps, or a mirror of his own conflict. She picked up her wine glass, and for a moment he thought she'd seen through everything, that the mission was blown and he'd have to improvise an exit strategy.

Instead, she raised the glass slightly. "To complicated ethics, then. And to people willing to take the first step."

He touched his glass to hers, the crystal ringing like a warning bell in the candlelit air.

**Scene 4: Mariana receives a phone call ...**

**Scene 4: Mariana receives a phone call and excuses herself from the table**

The vibration of Mariana's phone against the white tablecloth cut through their conversation like a blade. She glanced at the screen, and something flickered across her face—a micro-expression Max had been trained to catch. Concern? Irritation? It vanished before he could categorize it.

"I'm sorry," she said, already rising from her chair. "I need to take this."

"Of course."

She picked up the phone but left her clutch on the table, a small leather envelope in deep burgundy. Max watched her navigate between the crowded tables toward the restaurant's entrance, her silhouette disappearing into the amber glow of the Gothic Quarter's streetlights beyond the glass door.

His heart rate spiked immediately.

The device was in his jacket pocket, no larger than a USB drive. The techs at Langley had briefed him for exactly forty-five seconds on its operation: proximity to target device, press and hold, wait for the double vibration. Three to five seconds for a complete mirror. Child's play for an operative with his experience.

So why were his hands trembling?

Max reached for his wine glass, took a measured sip, his eyes tracking Mariana through the window. She stood with her back to the restaurant, one hand pressed to her ear, her posture rigid. Whoever was calling, it wasn't a pleasant conversation.

He had maybe two minutes. Three if he was lucky.

The device slid from his pocket with practiced ease, concealed in his palm. He leaned forward as if adjusting his napkin, his other hand moving toward her phone. The couple at the adjacent table was absorbed in their own world, feeding each other bites of crema catalana. The waiter had disappeared into the kitchen.

His fingers brushed the edge of her iPhone.

*This is your job*, he told himself. *This is what you came here to do.*

But the voice in his head sounded hollow, unconvincing. Twenty minutes ago, she'd been telling him about her childhood in Guadalajara, about watching her father work himself to exhaustion in a factory owned by American investors who never learned his name. Her eyes had held such fierce intelligence, such conviction. Not the cold calculation of a criminal, but genuine passion.

*She's also connected to Vershinsky. To whatever's happening with those weapons.*

Max pressed the device against the back of her phone, held the button. The vibration in his palm was subtle, almost imperceptible. He counted silently. One Mississippi. Two Mississippi. Outside, Mariana turned slightly, her free hand gesturing sharply.

Three Mississippi. Four Mississippi.

Sweat prickled at the base of his neck despite the restaurant's air conditioning. The scent of saffron and garlic from the paella at the next table suddenly seemed overpowering, cloying. A waiter emerged from the kitchen carrying a tray of desserts, moving in Max's direction.

Five Mississippi.

The double vibration pulsed against his palm.

He withdrew his hand, the device already disappearing back into his pocket as he reached for his wine glass again. The movement was fluid, unremarkable. Just a man drinking wine while waiting for his dinner companion to return.

The waiter passed without a glance.

Max's reflection stared back at him from the darkened window—a stranger in an expensive suit, playing a role, crossing a line he couldn't uncross. His father's voice echoed unbidden: *The ends justify the means, son. Remember that when things get complicated.*

But his father had died alone in a VA hospital, drowning in regrets and vodka.

Through the glass, Mariana ended her call. She stood for a moment, her shoulders rising and falling with a deep breath, before turning back toward the restaurant. Even from this distance, Max could see the tension in her jaw, the way her fingers gripped the phone.

He took another sip of wine. It tasted like ash.

When she slid back into her seat, her smile didn't quite reach her eyes. "I apologize. Business emergency."

"Everything alright?"

"Nothing I can't handle." She reached for her clutch, her phone already back in her hand. Her fingers drummed once against its case—a nervous gesture he hadn't seen from her before. "Where were we?"

"You were telling me about your first case at the ICC."

But as she began to speak, her words washing over him in that melodic accent, Max felt the weight of the device in his pocket like a stone. In his other pocket, his own phone was already transmitting the cloned data through encrypted channels to a server farm in Virginia, where analysts would tear through every message, every call, every deleted photo.

Every secret.

Mariana laughed at something, her hand briefly touching his across the table. Her skin was warm, her touch electric.

Max smiled back, playing his part, even as something fundamental shifted inside him—a fault line cracking, spreading, threatening the foundation of everything he'd built his life upon.

The waiter appeared with their main courses, the presentation artful and precise. Steam rose from the plates, carrying the rich aroma of seafood and saffron.

"This looks incredible," Mariana said, her eyes finally brightening.

"It does," Max agreed, though he suddenly had no appetite at all.

**Scene 5: Mariana returns to the table w...**

**Scene 5: Mariana returns to the table with a subtle shift in her demeanor**

The phone was back in Max's pocket, its secrets now flowing silently into CIA servers somewhere across the Atlantic, when Mariana reappeared between the stone archways that framed the restaurant's interior. She moved differently than before—the armor of professional distance had thinned, revealing something more fluid beneath.

"Everything alright?" Max asked, rising slightly as she settled back into her chair.

"Just work." She waved a dismissive hand, but her eyes held his a beat longer than necessary. "Always work. You understand this, I think."

The waiter materialized with impeccable timing, presenting a dessert menu bound in leather. Mariana didn't look at it.

"Do you like wine, Max? Real wine, not the business-lunch varietals?"

"I've been known to appreciate the real thing."

She spoke to the waiter in rapid Catalan, and he nodded with the reverence of a man receiving instructions about something sacred. When he departed, she leaned forward, candlelight catching the hollow of her throat.

"I ordered us something special. A Priorat from a small producer who lost his vineyard in the wildfires three years ago. This is from his final harvest." She traced the rim of her water glass. "There's something honest about last things, don't you think? No more room for pretense."

Max felt the weight of his phone against his ribs—the device that had just betrayed her trust while she'd been away from the table. "That's a dark philosophy for someone in the investment business. Aren't you supposed to believe in futures, not endings?"

"Investment is about understanding what dies and what survives." Her smile carried shadows. "Most people only want to discuss the survival part. But you can't have creation without destruction. Ask any artist."

The wine arrived in a decanter, dark as blood, and the waiter poured with ceremonial care. Mariana lifted her glass, studying the legs that ran down the interior.

"To honest things," she said.

They touched glasses, the crystal note hanging in the air between them. Max tasted smoke and earth, blackberries left too long in the sun. It was exceptional, and he told her so.

"My father taught me about wine," Mariana said, her voice softer now. "Before everything else, before the politics and the anger, he taught me that beauty matters. That creating something beautiful is an act of resistance against chaos." She paused, looking into her glass as if it held answers. "I think about that often. Whether what we create justifies what we destroy to create it."

Max recognized the opening—a vulnerability offered like a chess piece moved forward, testing whether he would take it or offer something in return. The professional response would be to deflect, to keep her talking while revealing nothing himself. But the wine was good, and her eyes were dark, and somewhere in the Gothic Quarter's labyrinth of shadows, he felt the boundaries of his mission beginning to blur.

"I knew someone once," he heard himself say, "who believed that art was the only honest language left. That everything else—politics, business, even love—was just negotiation in disguise."

"Knew? Past tense?"

"She died." The truth, stripped of context. "Car accident. Random and stupid and completely meaningless."

Mariana's hand moved across the table, stopping just short of touching his. "I'm sorry."

"It was a long time ago." Max took another drink, letting the wine burn down his throat. "But you're right about last things. She was a painter. After she died, I found out she'd destroyed most of her work. Kept only a few pieces. The ones that mattered, I suppose."

"What did you do with them?"

"Kept them." He met Mariana's gaze. "Even though looking at them hurts. Especially because looking at them hurts."

The silence that followed felt weighted with something beyond the mission, beyond the careful dance of operative and target. In the candlelight, Mariana's face had softened, the sharp edges of her professional persona giving way to something more human, more real.

"We're very good at this, you and I," she said quietly. "The performance. The careful words. But I think we're both tired tonight, yes? Tired of performing."

Max's training screamed warnings. This was the moment to retreat, to rebuild the professional distance, to remember that every word she spoke could be calculated, every gesture designed to manipulate. But her hand was still extended across the table, and the wine had loosened something in his chest, and he was tired—God, he was tired—of the constant calculation.

"Yes," he admitted. "I'm tired."

Her fingers found his, the touch light but deliberate. "Then let's stop. Just for tonight. No business, no strategies. Just two people who understand what it costs to always be performing."

The waiter brought dessert—something delicate involving honey and almonds—but neither of them noticed. Max was acutely aware of every point where Mariana's skin touched his, of the way her thumb moved in small circles against his palm, of the dangerous warmth spreading through his chest.

"Tell me something true," she said. "Something you haven't told anyone else."

It was a test, he knew. Everything with her was a test. But the line between what was real and what was performance had become so thin he could no longer see it clearly.

"I don't know anymore if I believe in what I'm doing," Max said, the words escaping before he could stop them. "I used to be certain. Now I just follow orders and tell myself it matters."

Mariana's grip tightened almost imperceptibly. "And does it? Matter?"

"I don't know. Does what you're doing matter?"

She smiled, but it was sad around the edges. "We're both soldiers, Max. Fighting wars that don't have clear battle lines anymore. Sometimes I think the only honest thing we can do is acknowledge that we're lost."

The admission hung between them, dangerous and intimate. Max knew he should pull back, should remember that her phone was compromised, that everything she said could be theater, that he was crossing lines that couldn't be uncrossed. But her hand was warm in his, and her eyes held a reflection of his own doubts, and for just this moment, he let himself forget that one of them was hunting the other.

"I'm glad you called me," Mariana said softly. "Even if this is complicated. Especially because it's complicated."

"So am I."

She withdrew her hand slowly, the loss of contact like cold air rushing in. "Walk with me? The Gothic Quarter is beautiful at night, and I'm not ready to go home yet."

Max signaled for the check, knowing that every step deeper into this connection was a step further from the clarity his mission required. But as they stood to leave, as Mariana's shoulder brushed against his, he found he didn't care.

Some lines, once crossed, changed everything.

**Scene 6: As they walk through the narro...**

**Scene 6: As they walk through the narrow, lamp-lit streets**

The Gothic Quarter breathed around them like a living thing. Ancient stone walls leaned inward, their weathered faces catching amber light from wrought-iron lamps that hung at irregular intervals. Max's footsteps echoed against the cobblestones, a half-beat behind Mariana's lighter tread.

She'd been quiet since they left the restaurant, her wine-flushed silence more unnerving than her earlier probing questions. The cloned phone data was already uploading to Langley's servers, invisible packets of stolen information flowing through the night. Max should have felt satisfied. Instead, the device in his pocket felt like a stone.

"You never answered my question," Mariana said, stopping beneath an archway that connected two medieval buildings. The passage was narrow enough that they stood close, the scent of her perfume mixing with the smell of old stone and night-blooming jasmine from someone's hidden courtyard.

"Which question?" Max knew exactly which one. He was stalling.

"About what you believe in." She turned to face him fully, her dark eyes catching the lamplight. "Justice or orders. Which one gets you out of bed in the morning, Max?"

The question should have been easy to deflect. He had a dozen prepared responses for this kind of philosophical fishing expedition—variations on patriotic duty, the greater good, the necessity of difficult choices in an imperfect world. The words lined up in his mind like good soldiers.

None of them came out.

"That's a false dichotomy," he said instead, hearing the defensive edge in his voice.

"Is it?" Mariana stepped closer, close enough that he could see the tiny scar above her left eyebrow, a small imperfection in her otherwise flawless face. "Because from where I stand, Max, people who truly believe in justice don't need to be given orders. They just act."

"And people who just act without orders often cause more harm than good."

"Do they?" She tilted her head, studying him with an intensity that made his skin prickle. "Or is that what people who follow orders tell themselves to sleep at night?"

A couple passed behind them, their laughter echoing off the stone before fading into the labyrinth of streets. Max was acutely aware of how isolated this archway was, how the shadows pooled around them like dark water. In another context, it would be romantic. Right now, it felt like an interrogation.

"You're oversimplifying," he said.

"I'm really not." Her voice softened, lost some of its edge. "I'm asking you a simple question. When you look at what you do—really look at it—do you sleep well?"

The honest answer was no. He hadn't slept well in years. Not since Kabul. Not since he'd started seeing the pattern—the way every mission led to another mission, every answer spawning ten new questions, every eliminated threat replaced by two more. The treadmill of it all.

But he couldn't say that. Not to her. Not when her phone was in his pocket, betraying her even as they stood here pretending at connection.

"I sleep fine," he lied.

Mariana's expression shifted, something like disappointment flickering across her features. Or maybe recognition. "You know what I think, Max? I think you're a man who's very good at his job. So good that you've forgotten why you started doing it in the first place."

"And you remember why you started yours?"

"Every single day." There was no hesitation in her voice, no doubt. "I remember every person Vershinsky's technology has helped. Every whistleblower who stayed alive because we gave them a way to communicate safely. Every journalist who exposed corruption because we protected their sources."

"And the terrorists who used those same tools to coordinate attacks? Do you remember them too?"

"Of course I do." She didn't flinch. "But I don't get to choose who needs privacy, Max. None of us do. That's the point. The moment you start deciding who deserves protection and who doesn't, you become exactly what you're fighting against."

A cool breeze swept through the archway, carrying the salt smell of the distant Mediterranean. Max felt it raise goosebumps on his arms beneath his jacket. Or maybe that was just the conversation, cutting closer to bone than he'd expected.

"That's a convenient philosophy when you're not the one dealing with the consequences," he said.

"Is it?" Mariana's hand came up, almost touching his chest before she seemed to think better of it, letting it fall back to her side. "Or is it just honest? Tell me something, Max. When was the last time you questioned an order?"

The answer came unbidden: *Today. Right now. Standing here with you.*

But he couldn't say that either. So he said nothing, and the silence stretched between them like a wire pulled taut.

Mariana watched him, waiting. When he didn't answer, she smiled—a sad, knowing smile that made something twist in his chest.

"That's what I thought," she said softly.

She turned to go, and Max's hand shot out before he could think about it, catching her wrist. She stopped, looking down at where his fingers circled her skin, then back up at his face.

"It's not that simple," he said, his voice rougher than he intended.

"It never is." She didn't pull away. "But that doesn't mean we stop asking the questions, Max. The moment we do, we're lost."

They stood like that for a long moment, connected by his hand on her wrist, by the weight of everything they weren't saying. Max could feel her pulse beneath his fingers, quick and strong. Could see the rise and fall of her breathing, the slight parting of her lips.

He should let go. Should step back, reassert the professional distance that had already eroded too far. Should remember that this woman was a target, that her phone was in his pocket, that everything about this moment was built on deception.

Instead, he found himself thinking about her question. About justice and orders. About the last time he'd felt certain he was doing the right thing instead of just the necessary thing.

"I should get you back to your hotel," he said, releasing her wrist.

"Should you?" There was a challenge in her voice, in the way she held his gaze.

"Yes."

"Why?"

Because if they stayed here much longer, in this shadowed archway with the ancient city breathing around them, Max was going to do something catastrophically stupid. Like tell her the truth. Like ask her if she knew what Vershinsky was really planning. Like warn her that the walls were closing in.

Like kiss her.

"Because it's late," he said. "And you have an early flight tomorrow."

Mariana studied him for another moment, then nodded slowly. "You're right. Of course." She stepped out of the archway, back into the lamplight. "Thank you for dinner, Max. And for the conversation."

"Will you think about what I said? About Vershinsky's investment opportunities?"

"I'll think about a lot of things you said tonight." She looked back at him, still standing in the shadows. "Will you?"

Before he could answer, she turned and walked away, her heels clicking against the cobblestones. Max watched her go, her figure growing smaller as she navigated the narrow street with the confidence of someone who knew exactly where she was going.

He waited until she turned a corner and disappeared before pulling out his phone. The upload was complete. Langley would have everything now—her contacts, her messages, her calendar, her location history. Every digital breadcrumb that might lead them to Vershinsky.

Max should have felt triumphant. Instead, he felt like he'd stolen something more valuable than data.

His phone buzzed. A message from Hendricks: *Good work. Debrief at 0800.*

Max pocketed the phone and started walking in the opposite direction, toward his own hotel. The Gothic Quarter's narrow streets seemed to close in around him, the ancient stones pressing close like the walls of a confessional.

*Do you believe in justice or merely in following orders?*

The question followed him through the darkness, unanswered and unanswerable, as persistent as his own footsteps echoing off the stone.
