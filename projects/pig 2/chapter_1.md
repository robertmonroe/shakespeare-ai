## Chapter 1: Oink in the City

**Scene 1: Johnny walks home from school,...**

The rain was that annoying kind that soaked you right through even under an umbrella. Johnny hunched deeper into his worn denim jacket, the collar doing little to protect his neck from the city's cold, wet breath. Each footstep splashed miniature grey geysers that mirrored the monotony of the towering apartment blocks lining the street.

He kicked at a discarded soda can, sending it clattering against a fire hydrant. The sound was swallowed almost instantly by the city's constant hum – the rumble of buses, the distant wail of a siren, the muffled conversations bleeding from doorways. Even the noise felt predictable, rehearsed.

Johnny navigated the familiar obstacle course of overflowing garbage bins and puddles reflecting the neon glare of a pawn shop sign. He knew every crack in the sidewalk, every stained patch of concrete. He could probably walk this route blindfolded and still end up back at his cramped apartment, a concrete cage on the fifteenth floor.

He pulled out his phone, scrolling through the same tired apps. Instagram was a barrage of perfectly curated lives he couldn't relate to. TikTok was a dizzying blur of fleeting trends he didn't understand. Even the games felt hollow, the victories meaningless.

A raindrop clung precariously to his eyelash, blurring the already dismal view. He swiped the phone shut, shoving it back in his pocket. He longed for something…anything… to break the suffocating rhythm of his days. Something real. Something…wild.

He imagined a sudden burst of colour amidst the grey, a spontaneous explosion of laughter in the sterile silence. Maybe a flock of parrots erupting from a fire escape, painting the sky with emerald and scarlet. Or maybe… he didn't even know *what* he wanted. Just *something*.

The thought made him quicken his pace, as if escaping his own restless thoughts. He rounded a corner, heading towards the narrow alley that served as a shortcut to his building. The smell of stale pizza and damp cardboard hung heavy in the air. He was almost home. Almost back in his cage. A sigh escaped his lips, a puff of white against the grey canvas of the city. Little did he know, his world was about to get a whole lot more colourful.

**Scene 2: Johnny spots a pig, Arnie, in ...** behind the butcher shop.

The alley reeked of stale meat and wet cardboard. Johnny, hugging his backpack tighter against the drizzle, cut through it as a shortcut. Puddles mirrored the grey sky, each slick surface reflecting the brick wall rising on his left, and the chain-link fence enclosing a small, muddy lot on his right. He almost missed it.

A snort. Not the dismissive kind, but one thick with distress.

Johnny stopped. He craned his neck, peering through the gaps in the chain link. At first, he saw only mud and discarded vegetable crates. Then, movement. A flash of pink against the drab browns and greys.

There, huddling in the far corner, was a pig. Not a miniature pot-bellied one, the kind some eccentric city-dwellers kept as pets. This was a proper pig. A large, pink, undeniably out-of-place pig. It was pacing back and forth in a tight circle, its snout twitching nervously. The air around it vibrated with an aura of bewildered misery.

Rain plastered its coarse bristles to its skin, making it look even more forlorn. He could see its ribs pressing against its side with each anxious breath. The pig let out another snort, a high-pitched squeal that seemed to bounce off the brick wall.

"Hey," Johnny whispered, stepping closer to the fence. "Hey there, buddy. You okay?"

The pig froze, its small, beady eyes snapping towards him. For a moment, they stared at each other, a silent connection forged between a lost teenager and a lost pig. Johnny could practically feel the pig's confusion radiating through the chain link.

The pig took a tentative step forward, its hooves sinking slightly into the mud. It regarded Johnny with a mixture of fear and curiosity. He reached out a hand, slowly, palm open.

"Easy, easy," he murmured, his voice a low, soothing rumble. "I'm not gonna hurt you."

The pig remained hesitant, but it didn't retreat. It let out a soft, questioning grunt, a sound that tugged at Johnny's heart. He felt a surge of protectiveness, an overwhelming urge to help this animal that clearly didn't belong here. He glanced at the butcher shop, its windows steamed up, oblivious to the drama unfolding in the alley behind.

He knew he couldn't just leave it there. This pig needed help. And for some reason, he, Johnny, was the one who found him.

The pig snorted again, then nudged its snout against the fence, a silent plea. Johnny looked deep into the pig's eyes. He decided right then and there. He was going to help this pig. He just didn't have the slightest idea how.

**Scene 3: Arnie breaks through the flims...**

A section of the rickety wooden fence bordering Mrs. Gable's petting zoo *splintered* with a groan. Johnny, huddled deeper into the doorway to escape the persistent drizzle, almost missed it. He'd been too busy watching a gaggle of tourists pose for photos with a costumed hotdog vendor. Then, a pink snout, followed by a stout body, shoved its way through the newly-formed gap.

Arnie.

The pig wobbled onto the slick asphalt, blinking in the harsh glare of the streetlights reflecting off the wet pavement. He took a hesitant step, then another, his little hooves slipping slightly. The air, thick with the acrid smell of exhaust and frying street food, seemed to confuse him.

"Whoa, hey!" Johnny called out instinctively, but his voice was swallowed by the roar of an approaching taxi.

The taxi driver, phone glued to his ear, didn't see Arnie until the last second. A screech of tires, a blaring horn, and a near miss left Arnie squealing in terror, scrambling backwards towards the broken fence. He stumbled, his plump body swaying precariously.

Johnny’s heart leaped into his throat. He couldn’t just stand there. He saw the bewildered panic in Arnie’s wide, dark eyes – eyes that moments ago had been filled with the joy of an impromptu dance.

Dropping his backpack with a thump, Johnny darted forward, dodging a businessman with an overflowing briefcase. “Watch out!” he yelled, his voice barely audible above the city’s cacophony. He reached Arnie just as a delivery scooter zipped past, missing the pig by inches.

“Easy, easy there, big fella,” Johnny soothed, reaching out a hand cautiously towards Arnie’s bristly back. The pig flinched, but didn’t run. He seemed utterly disoriented, lost in a sea of rushing metal and hurried feet. He shivered slightly, his pink skin slick with rain.

“Come on,” Johnny said, his voice a little steadier now. He crouched down, offering Arnie a tentative scratch behind the ears. Arnie leaned into the touch, letting out a small, shaky oink. "Let's get you out of the road, okay?"

The rain seemed to intensify, plastering Johnny's hair to his forehead. He knew he couldn't just leave Arnie here. But what was he supposed to do with a pig in the middle of the city? The question slammed into him with the force of a runaway subway train. This was insane.

But as he looked at Arnie, trembling and bewildered, the weight of responsibility settled on Johnny's shoulders. He couldn't turn his back.

"Alright," Johnny muttered to himself, glancing around nervously at the curious stares of passersby. "Alright, let's figure this out." He gently guided Arnie towards the relative safety of the sidewalk, away from the relentless flow of traffic. He needed a plan, and he needed it fast. The image of Mrs. Gable, red-faced and shouting, flashed through his mind. This was going to be a disaster. But somehow, a tiny spark of excitement, mingled with a hefty dose of anxiety, flickered within him. This was definitely an adventure, alright. And it had only just begun.

**Scene 4: Johnny coaxes Arnie into a des...**

The overpass loomed above, a concrete leviathan swallowing the gray sky. Rain still drizzled, but the heavy downpour had eased, leaving a shimmering sheen on the cracked asphalt of the deserted park beneath. Johnny tugged gently on the frayed rope leash he'd fashioned from his backpack strap. "Come on, Arnie. Just a little further. It's dry-ish under here."

Arnie resisted, his stubby legs planted firmly on the soggy ground. He let out a soft, disgruntled oink, his gaze fixed on a discarded newspaper clinging forlornly to a chain-link fence. Johnny knelt, stroking Arnie's bristly back. "Look, no more rain. And… no one else." He scanned the expanse of broken swings, graffiti-covered benches, and overgrown weeds. The place was a forgotten corner of the city, perfect for a pig who wanted to avoid becoming bacon.

Another gentle tug, accompanied by a reassuring, "Good boy, Arnie," and the pig finally relented, shuffling reluctantly into the sheltered space beneath the overpass. The air was thick with the smell of damp concrete and something vaguely metallic. Arnie shook himself, sending a spray of muddy water in Johnny's direction. Johnny chuckled, wiping his face with his sleeve.

Relief seemed to wash over Arnie. He snorted, a happy little puff, and suddenly, almost involuntarily, started to prance. Not like a clumsy farm animal, but with a surprising lightness, a playful energy that rippled through his pink, plump body. He took a few tentative steps, then another, his hooves clicking softly on the asphalt.

Johnny watched, mesmerized. "Whoa… you're… dancing?"

Arnie didn't answer, lost in his own world of rhythmic movement. He took a few steps forward, dipped his head low, then kicked out a hind leg, almost comically, before spinning in a tight circle. It wasn't perfect, not graceful in a classical sense, but it was undeniably dance. A joyful, uninhibited expression of pure, porcine delight.

A wide grin spread across Johnny's face. He clapped his hands, a rhythmic beat that seemed to encourage Arnie further. "Yeah! That's it, Arnie! Show me what you got!"

Arnie responded to the applause, his movements becoming bolder, more confident. He did a little jig, a sideways shuffle, and even a clumsy, but undeniably enthusiastic, attempt at a plié. The sound of his snorts and the tap of his hooves echoed under the overpass, a strangely enchanting symphony in the urban wasteland.

Johnny felt a lightness he hadn't experienced in… well, he couldn't remember when. Here, under the rumbling of traffic above, with a dancing pig as his audience, the city felt a little less suffocating, a little less lonely. A connection, a strange and unexpected one, had been forged.

As Arnie finished his impromptu performance with a final, triumphant squeal, Johnny approached him slowly, extending a hand. "You're amazing, Arnie. Truly amazing." He gently scratched Arnie behind the ears, and the pig leaned into the touch, his eyes closing in contentment. Johnny knew, in that moment, that he couldn't just let Arnie go. He had to help him. He had to keep him safe. And maybe, just maybe, he had to learn how to dance, too. "Okay, buddy," Johnny said softly, "let's figure out what we're going to do next." He pulled out his phone and glanced at the sky, the rain starting to pick up again. "We can't stay here forever."

**Scene 5: Johnny, captivated by Arnie's ...** awkward but enthusiastic waltz, couldn’t help but laugh. The echoing rumble of the overpass amplified the sound, bouncing off the wet concrete. “Okay, okay, hold on there, Arnie!” he said, stepping closer. The pig stopped, panting slightly, his surprisingly intelligent eyes fixed on Johnny.

Rain still drizzled, a fine mist that clung to Johnny’s eyelashes. The abandoned park, usually a depressing expanse of cracked asphalt and graffiti, felt almost magical under the grey sky. The puddles reflected the city lights above, turning the ground into a shimmering, distorted mirror. The air smelled of wet earth and something vaguely metallic, likely from the rusted swing set chained to a pole nearby.

“Let’s try something simpler,” Johnny said, extending a hand. Hesitantly, Arnie nudged his snout into Johnny’s palm, the bristly hairs surprisingly soft. Johnny gently guided the pig, placing his other hand on Arnie’s surprisingly firm back. "Just...step, slide, step. Like this."

He demonstrated, moving slowly to the rhythm of a silent tune in his head. Arnie, bless his porcine heart, tried to mimic him. He stumbled a few times, his hooves clicking against the pavement, but he kept at it. Johnny chuckled again, this time with genuine affection.

“That’s it, Arnie! You’re a natural…almost.”

They practiced for a few more minutes, Johnny patiently guiding Arnie, laughing at his occasional missteps. A strange sense of calm settled over Johnny, washing away the restlessness he’d been feeling all day. He was teaching a pig to dance. In a park. Under an overpass. It was ridiculous, absurd, and utterly wonderful.

The rain lessened to a mere sprinkle. Johnny looked down at Arnie, who was now nudging his leg with his snout, a low grunt rumbling in his chest. He realized something: he couldn’t just leave Arnie here. He couldn’t imagine doing it.

The thought of Arnie alone, wandering the city, lost and vulnerable, twisted his stomach. No. He couldn’t let that happen.

Johnny crouched down, scratching Arnie behind his ears. The pig closed his eyes, a contented sigh escaping his nostrils. "Okay, Arnie," Johnny said, his voice firm with a newfound resolve. "We're in this together. Now, let's figure out how to get you somewhere safe." He stood up, his gaze scanning the city skyline visible through the overpass supports. "Come on. We have a problem to solve." He tugged gently on the makeshift leash. Arnie followed without hesitation, his hooves clip-clopping softly on the wet concrete, a strange and unlikely partnership forged in the heart of the city.
