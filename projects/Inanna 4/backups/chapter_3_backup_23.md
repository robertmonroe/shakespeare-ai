## Chapter 3: The Decree of Extinction

**Scene 1: The Golden Throne's Judgment**

The Hall of Eternal Stars stretched before Inanna like the gullet of some vast cosmic serpent, its vaulted ceiling lost in manufactured darkness studded with holographic constellations. Ten thousand years of Anunnaki dominion glittered in those false stars—each point of light representing a world conquered, a species subjugated, a civilization reduced to ore and energy for the empire's endless hunger.

She stood among the nobility on the observation tier, her ceremonial robes of woven gold-light feeling heavier than battle armor. The air tasted of ozone and ancient incense, that particular blend of myrrh and synthesized nebula-dust that burned only in the presence of the King. Around her, the great houses of Nibiru had assembled in their finery—the Igigi warrior clans in their crimson mantles, the Nephilim administrators draped in silver circuitry, the lesser bloodlines crowding the galleries above like carrion birds awaiting a feast.

Below, on the obsidian floor polished to mirror-brightness, the throne of Anu rose like a frozen explosion of gold and crystal. Her father sat upon it, ancient and terrible, his face a mask of serene authority that Inanna had learned to read since childhood. Today, that mask showed satisfaction.

*He's already decided,* she realized, her stomach clenching. *This ceremony is merely theater.*

Through the chamber's transparent floor, Earth turned in slow majesty. The blue-green sphere caught the light of its yellow sun, clouds swirling in patterns that Inanna had memorized over centuries of observation. She could see the fertile crescent of Mesopotamia from here, that cradle of human civilization where she had walked among them, learned their names, tasted their wine.

"The question before us," Anu's voice rolled through the hall, amplified by acoustic architecture perfected across millennia, "is not whether the human experiment has failed. That much is beyond dispute."

A murmur of agreement rippled through the assembled nobles. Inanna kept her face carefully neutral, though her fingers curled against her palms hard enough to leave crescents in her flesh.

"The question," her father continued, rising from his throne with the fluid grace that belied his age, "is how we address this failure. How we correct the contamination before it spreads beyond acceptable parameters."

On the massive display screens flanking the throne, images materialized—Earth, that blue-green jewel spinning in the darkness. The view zoomed closer, showing human settlements spreading across the fertile crescents, the river valleys, the coastal plains. Villages of mud brick and carved stone. Fields golden with grain. Children playing in dusty paths.

Inanna had walked those paths. She had eaten bread baked in those clay ovens, had listened to human poets compose verses to her beauty, had watched mothers sing their infants to sleep under stars their eyes could barely perceive. She had been worshipped as a goddess, yes—but she had also been *seen* by them in ways her own kind never bothered to look.

"Commander Enlil will present the strategic assessment," Anu announced.

Her half-brother strode forward from the military contingent, his boots striking the dais with precise, measured steps. Where Anu was ancient and regal, Enlil was vital and hungry—a warrior in his prime, his muscular frame barely contained by his ceremonial armor. The neural interface ports along his temples gleamed with recent use; he'd been running combat simulations again, Inanna knew. Practicing for a war against an enemy that couldn't possibly fight back.

"Genetic drift has exceeded all projections," Enlil announced, summoning data streams with practiced efficiency. Population graphs spiked upward, genetic markers highlighted in warning red, thermal imaging of human settlements spreading like luminescent patterns across Earth's surface. "Current human population: approximately fifteen million, concentrated primarily in the Mesopotamian region but spreading rapidly. Projected population in one hundred cycles: over fifty million."

He gestured, and the holographic display transformed. "The kill switch engineered into their genome by Lord Enki's laboratories remains viable in approximately sixty-three percent of the population. The remaining thirty-seven percent have developed anomalies—the modifications our Chief Geneticist introduced to enhance their cognitive function have proven unstable. They are evolving faster than projected."

"They're breeding true," someone called from the assembly. Lord Nergal, his scarred face split by a predator's grin. "The modifications are becoming hereditary."

"Precisely," Enlil confirmed. "At current rates, within another fifty generations, the kill switch will be completely bred out of the population. Additionally, their capacity for abstract thought, for innovation, for *ambition*—" He let the word hang. "—has exceeded all models. They're asking questions. Building things we didn't teach them. Some have begun to suspect the truth of their origins."

A sharp intake of breath from somewhere behind Inanna. She didn't turn to see who still possessed enough conscience to be disturbed.

"Then the solution is clear," Nergal announced. "Activate the kill switch in those who carry it. Hunt down the rest. I'll lead the culling myself—my Igigi have grown soft without proper sport."

Laughter, scattered but genuine, echoed through the hall. Inanna felt bile rise in her throat.

"A crude solution, nephew," Anu said, though his tone suggested approval rather than rebuke. "And incomplete. Even if we eliminated every human on the planet's surface, their genetic material has spread too far. Caves, islands, remote highlands—we would spend centuries hunting down survivors."

He gestured to Enlil. "Present Project Deluge."

Enlil bowed, manipulating his control interface. "Project Deluge represents the culmination of three centuries of contingency planning. Phase One: The Genetic Cascade. The activation signal will be broadcast from our orbital relay network. Global coverage within six hours. Sixty-three percent mortality from the kill switch alone."

The image animated, showing the signal propagating across Earth's surface like a wave of invisible death.

"Phase Two: The Deluge itself. The orbital platforms we positioned during the initial terraforming remain functional. By redirecting their output to the polar ice sheets, we trigger a cascading melt event." The polar regions glowed, then cracked, then collapsed into the surrounding oceans. Massive waves radiated outward from both poles. "Sea levels rise by approximately one hundred meters within the first thirty days. Every coastal settlement destroyed. Every river valley becomes an inland sea."

The holographic Earth transformed before their eyes. Continents shrank as the waters rose. The fertile crescent where humanity had built its greatest settlements vanished beneath a spreading blue stain.

"Any humans who survive the genetic cascade will find themselves in a world without shelter, without food, without hope. Combined mortality: over ninety-five percent. The survivors face starvation, exposure, and the predatory species we've already begun seeding in the mountain regions." Enlil's voice rose with barely concealed triumph. "Total extinction achieved within one quarter-cycle, with minimal resource expenditure and no risk to Anunnaki personnel."

Silence fell over the hall. Inanna counted her heartbeats—one, two, three—waiting for someone, *anyone*, to object.

"The mineral extraction facilities?" asked Lord Shamash, ever practical.

"Will require reconstruction, but the automated systems are designed to survive submersion. We estimate eighteen months to restore full production capacity."

"And the biological samples? The genetic archive?"

"Already secured aboard the orbital stations. The human template can be reconstructed if needed, with appropriate modifications to prevent future complications."

Shamash nodded, apparently satisfied. Around him, other nobles were already calculating their shares of the reconstruction contracts, their eyes bright with avarice.

Inanna's gaze swept the crowd, searching for allies, for doubt, for anything resembling the horror that churned in her own chest. She found precious few. Lord Enki, who had actually designed the human genome, wore an expression of carefully masked distaste—but he stood in silence. Lady Ereshkigal, keeper of the death records, watched with the professional interest of one anticipating a significant increase in her workload.

And there—near the back of the Igigi delegation—a young warrior whose name Inanna couldn't recall, his face pale, his hands trembling slightly at his sides. Their eyes met for a brief moment before he looked away, shame and fear warring in his expression.

*At least I'm not entirely alone,* she thought. *Though that may not matter.*

"The Council of Twelve has reviewed the proposal," Anu announced, reclaiming the hall's attention. "We have found it sound. Therefore, by the authority vested in this throne by the First Compact of Nibiru, I hereby decree: the human experiment is terminated. All specimens are to be eliminated. The cleansing will commence at the next orbital alignment—three days hence."

He raised his scepter, that ancient rod of office that had commanded the fates of a hundred worlds, and brought it down against the throne's arm with a sound like thunder.

"So it is spoken. So it shall be done."

The hall erupted in applause. Nobles raised their voices in praise of the King's wisdom, his decisive leadership, his protection of the empire's interests. Someone began a chant—"Anu! Anu! Anu!"—and it spread through the crowd like wildfire.

Inanna forced her hands to move, to mime the motions of celebration. Her face ached from the effort of maintaining her smile. Around her, the cream of Anunnaki civilization cheered the extinction of fifteen million souls as casually as they might celebrate a successful pest extermination.

*Three days,* she thought, the number burning itself into her mind. *I have three days to save them.*

On the screens, the simulation continued its terrible loop—water rising, settlements drowning, a species dying. And in the golden light of the Hall of Eternal Stars, the gods of humanity toasted their creation's end with cups of fermented starlight.

Inanna drank when the cup was pressed into her hand. The liquid tasted like ashes.

**Scene 2: The Celebration of Extinction**

The celebration spilled from the Hall of Eternal Stars into the adjoining reception chamber, where crystal formations harvested from Nibiru's deepest caverns lined the walls. Each one captured and refracted the bioluminescent light streaming from living chandeliers overhead—colonial creatures from the methane seas of a conquered moon, pulsing in synchronized rhythms, their blue-green glow washing over the assembled nobility like waves upon a shore.

Inanna moved through the crowd with practiced grace, accepting congratulations she didn't deserve for a victory she abhorred. Servants in simple gray tunics bore trays of fermented nectar, the amber liquid glowing faintly with enzymes that made it palatable only to Anunnaki physiology. The nobles snatched glasses without acknowledgment, their attention fixed on the holographic entertainment projecting above the central fountain—a rotating display of Earth, its blue surface marked with red zones indicating population centers soon to be erased.

"Remarkable density in the river valleys," Lord Shamash was saying to a cluster of admirers, gesturing at the projection with his drink. "The creatures congregated there like insects around sweetwater. Makes the cleanup considerably more efficient."

Laughter rippled through the group.

Inanna kept walking, her ceremonial robes suddenly too heavy, too warm. The golden thread woven through the fabric caught the bioluminescent light and threw patterns across the polished floor—patterns that reminded her of the cave paintings she'd observed through the monitoring drones. Human hands pressed against stone, leaving marks that said *I was here. I existed.*

Soon, nothing would remain to prove they ever had.

"Princess!" A young noble approached with an eager smile. "Magnificent news, isn't it? My father says the flooding will create the most spectacular geological formations. He's already planning an expedition to observe the aftermath."

"How forward-thinking of him."

"Indeed! Though I confess, I'll miss the entertainment value. The monitoring feeds have been quite diverting these past centuries. Did you know some of them actually developed music? Primitive percussion and vocal arrangements. Charming, in a simple-minded way."

Inanna's nails dug into her palms. "Charming."

"Ah, but I'm monopolizing your attention." The noble bowed with practiced grace. "Do enjoy the celebration, Princess."

He vanished into the crowd, and Inanna resumed her slow circuit of the chamber. Near the fountain, a minor administrator stared into his drink with an expression that might have been discomfort. By the eastern windows, a young priestess stood apart from her sisters, her lips moving in what could have been prayer. An elderly scholar watched the holographic Earth with something other than celebration in his ancient eyes.

Three. Perhaps four, if she counted the servant who flinched every time someone mentioned the word "extinction."

Out of hundreds.

"Inanna."

The voice came from her left, barely above a whisper. Inanna turned to find her mother standing in the shadow of a crystal formation, her silver robes blending with the blue-green light until she seemed almost translucent.

Queen Antu held no drink. Her hands were clasped before her, the only sign of tension the slight whitening of her knuckles.

"Mother."

They stood in silence for a moment, the celebration swirling around them like a current around two stones in a stream. Antu's face was composed as ever—the perfect mask of royal dignity she had worn for millennia. But her eyes met Inanna's, and in them, Inanna saw something she couldn't quite name. Not horror, exactly. Not even disagreement. Something older. Something tired.

"You should be mingling," Antu said finally. "Your absence from the festivities will be noted."

"Let it be noted."

"Inanna." The single word carried a weight of warning.

"How can you stand here?" Inanna kept her voice low, conscious of the nobles drifting past. "How can any of them? We're discussing the murder of fifteen million thinking, feeling beings. Beings we *created*."

"Like the culling of an invasive species." Antu's tone was flat. "Like the controlled burn of an overgrown forest. Like a hundred other administrative necessities this empire has undertaken across a thousand worlds."

"Is that what you believe?"

The question hung between them. Antu's expression flickered—just for an instant—before the mask reasserted itself.

"What I believe is irrelevant. What matters is what is."

"That's not an answer."

"No," Antu agreed softly. "It isn't."

She glanced around the chamber—a quick, practiced sweep that took in every potential observer—before leaning closer.

"There are things," she breathed, "that a queen cannot say. Cannot even think, not in any way that leaves evidence. But a mother..." She paused, and her hand brushed Inanna's arm. "A mother can hope that her daughter is wiser than she appears. And more cautious."

Before Inanna could respond, Antu pressed something into her palm—a data chip no larger than a fingernail, warm from her mother's grip.

"The jungle remembers," Antu whispered. "Even when we forget, the jungle remembers what we were before we became gods."

Then she stepped back, her public mask sliding into place with practiced ease.

"Do try the nectar, dear. The vintage is exceptional." She raised her voice just enough to be overheard. "And do remember to congratulate Lord Shamash on his contribution to the environmental projections. He's quite proud of his calculations."

Then she was gone, gliding through the crowd with the effortless grace of someone who had spent millennia navigating treacherous waters.

Inanna stood alone, her mother's gift burning against her palm. She didn't dare examine it here, but she knew—with the certainty of blood—that it contained coordinates. A destination. A chance.

*She knows. She's always known.*

Queen Antu, who smiled through state functions and played the role of dutiful consort with flawless precision. Who had given her daughter a knife on her naming day and spoken of remembering. Who had, perhaps, been running her own quiet rebellion for longer than Inanna had been alive.

The summons came through her personal comm unit before she could process her mother's gift—a single pulse of crimson light that made her blood run cold. Her father's cipher. His private chambers. Immediately.

Inanna straightened her shoulders, slipped the data chip into the hidden pocket sewn into her sleeve, and began moving through the crowd. She would answer the summons. She would play her role.

But her mother's words echoed in her mind like a promise.

*The jungle remembers.*

**Scene 3: The King's Private Warning**

King Anu's private chambers bore no resemblance to the opulent throne room where he performed his power for the masses. Here, austerity reigned. The walls were bare gray stone, unpolished and ancient—fragments of Nibiru's original crust, preserved from before the great catastrophe that had set their world wandering between stars. Holographic displays floated in precise geometric arrangements, each one showing strategic data: troop movements, resource allocations, the slow orbital dance of their fleet around Earth.

Her father stood with his back to her, studying a three-dimensional map of Earth's polar regions. Ice caps glowed an ethereal blue, overlaid with targeting trajectories in arterial red.

"Close the door, Inanna."

She obeyed, and the obsidian panels sealed behind her with a sound like a tomb being shut.

"You left the celebration early." Anu did not turn. "Your absence was noted."

"I received your summons, Father. I came immediately."

"Before the summons." Now he turned, and Inanna saw something in his eyes she had rarely witnessed: genuine anger, barely contained. "You were seen speaking with your mother in the shadows. You were seen accepting something from her hand."

Inanna's heart stuttered, but she kept her face composed. "A token of comfort. Mother knows how I struggle with large gatherings."

"Do not." The word cracked through the chamber like a whip. "Do not insult my intelligence with lies you would not believe yourself."

He gestured, and one of the floating displays shifted, expanding to fill the space between them. Inanna watched her own face appear—security footage from the observation deck, timestamp marking it as three solar cycles past. She saw herself pressing her hand against the viewport, tears tracking silver lines down her cheeks as she gazed at Earth.

The image changed. Her, accessing restricted cultural archives. Her, lingering in the bio-research wing where human specimens were studied. Her, questioning a junior scientist about the genetic kill switch's mechanism with poorly disguised horror.

"You have been monitoring me," she said, proud that her voice remained steady.

"I have been protecting you." Anu dismissed the display with a wave. "Do you think you are the first young royal to develop sympathies? Your grandmother wept for a dying species once. A silicon-based collective on the third moon of Aldebaran. She recovered. You will too."

He moved to a cabinet carved from petrified wood—a relic from some long-dead world—and withdrew a crystal decanter filled with amber liquid. The scent of fermented starfruit reached Inanna's nostrils as he poured two glasses.

"I have tried to be patient," Anu continued, offering her a glass. She took it but did not drink. "I told myself it was youth. Inexperience. That exposure to the humans' art and music had temporarily clouded your judgment." He sipped his own drink, watching her over the rim. "But tonight, at the ceremony, I saw your face. I saw what you were thinking."

"And what was I thinking, Father?"

"That we are monsters." He said it simply, without accusation. "That what we do is wrong. That these creatures—these beautiful, tragic, doomed creatures—deserve to live."

The accuracy of his assessment stole her breath.

"They are sentient beings," she heard herself say. "They create. They love. They—"

"They are tools." Anu's voice hardened. "Tools we made for a specific purpose, tools that have outlived their usefulness. Would you weep for a mining drone? A harvesting automaton?"

"They are not machines!"

"No. They are worse." He set down his glass with deliberate precision. "Machines do not rebel. Machines do not dream of overthrowing their creators. Machines do not breed beyond control and consume resources meant for their betters."

He crossed the chamber to a display case Inanna had never been permitted to examine closely. Inside, behind shimmering force fields, rested artifacts of terrible antiquity: a crown of black metal, a scepter that seemed to drink the light, and a small clay tablet covered in wedge-shaped marks.

"Do you know what this is?" He indicated the tablet.

"No."

"It is a prayer. One of the first humans ever wrote it, thousands of years ago. Do you know what it says?" He did not wait for her answer. "'Great Anu, father of gods, we are your servants. Command us and we obey. Our lives are yours, our deaths are yours. We exist only for your glory.'"

He turned to face her, and his expression had shifted to something almost sorrowful.

"They understood, once. They knew their place. But we were careless. We let them forget. We let them develop delusions of independence, of worth, of rights." He shook his head. "This extinction is not cruelty, daughter. It is correction. It is the restoration of natural order."

"Natural?" Inanna's laugh came out bitter, broken. "We made them. We designed their very genes. There is nothing natural about any of this."

"Then call it necessary." Anu's patience was visibly thinning. "Call it inevitable. Call it whatever you must to accept it, because accept it you will."

He moved closer, and despite herself, Inanna took a step back. Her father had never struck her—had never needed to. His disapproval alone had always been weapon enough.

"You are my daughter," he said, his voice dropping to something almost tender. "My blood. My heir. The future of our dynasty flows through your veins. I will not see that future compromised by misplaced sentiment for a species that will be forgotten within a generation."

"And if I cannot forget them?"

The tenderness vanished. "Then you will be forgotten with them."

The words hung in the recycled air between them, their meaning unmistakable. Inanna thought of the exile ships, the prison moons, the quiet disappearances of those who had opposed royal will. Her aunt, who had spoken against the conquest of the Pleiades colonies. Her cousin, who had questioned the legitimacy of Anu's claim to the throne. Gone, all of them. Erased from history as thoroughly as the humans would soon be erased from Earth.

"I am offering you a choice," Anu continued. "A choice I am not required to offer. Embrace your heritage. Take your place beside me as we shepherd our people into a new era. The humans' resources will fuel our expansion for millennia. Their planet will be terraformed into a paradise worthy of Anunnaki habitation. You could rule it, Inanna. Earth could be yours."

She saw it then—the future he was painting. Herself on a throne of human bones, presiding over a world scrubbed clean of its original inhabitants. Gardens growing where settlements had stood. Palaces rising from the ashes of human civilization. A queen of the dead.

"And my other choice?"

"There is no other choice." His eyes were ancient, cold, utterly certain. "There is only acceptance or destruction. Those are the only options our universe provides."

Inanna looked at her father—really looked at him—and saw for the first time the monster he had always been. Not evil, perhaps. Not in his own mind. Simply incapable of recognizing humanity in anything that was not Anunnaki. To him, the humans were no more worthy of moral consideration than the bacteria that lived in their guts.

And she understood, with crystalline clarity, that she could never make him see otherwise.

So she did what she had learned to do in a lifetime of surviving his court. She lied.

"You are right, Father." She let her shoulders drop, let her voice tremble with manufactured shame. "I have been foolish. Weak. I allowed myself to become attached to subjects of study, nothing more."

She raised her eyes to meet his, filling them with the desperate need for approval she had genuinely felt as a child.

"I do not want to be forgotten. I do not want to lose my place, my family, everything I have known." A tear—real, but born of grief rather than submission—traced down her cheek. "Please. Help me be stronger. Help me be worthy of your legacy."

Anu studied her for a long moment. She felt his gaze like a physical weight, pressing against her defenses, searching for cracks in her performance.

Then he smiled—a cold expression, but genuine.

"I knew you would see reason." He reached out and wiped the tear from her cheek with one calloused thumb. "You have your mother's softness, but my steel lies beneath it. I have always known this."

He gestured toward the door. "Go. Rest. The extinction will begin at the orbital alignment—three days from now. By then, I expect you to have fully mastered your emotions. You will stand beside me as we watch the floods cleanse Earth. You will not weep. You will not flinch. You will show our people that the royal house stands united."

"Yes, Father."

"And Inanna?" She paused at the door. "I will be watching. Every moment. Every breath. Until the cleansing is complete, you will not leave my sight. Consider it protective custody."

Her blood turned to ice water. Not three days of freedom to plan. He meant to keep her confined, monitored, until it was too late.

She inclined her head in acknowledgment and stepped through the obsidian doors. They sealed behind her, and she walked calmly through the corridors of power, nodding to guards, exchanging pleasantries with passing nobles.

Her father's final words echoed in her mind. *I will be watching. Every moment.*

Three days had become a luxury she could no longer afford. If he was watching—truly watching—he would see her preparations. He would know.

She would have to move tonight.

**Scene 4: Preparations in Shadow**

Inanna entered her chambers with measured steps, forcing herself to maintain the appearance of calm even as her mind raced. The privacy shields engaged automatically as the door sealed behind her, but she knew better than to trust them completely. Her father's surveillance was everywhere—and now, after his warning, it would be focused entirely on her.

Her quarters stretched before her—a curved expanse of polished obsidian floors and walls that shifted between opacity and transparency at a thought. Currently, they showed the star field beyond the station, Earth hanging like a blue-green jewel in the lower quadrant of her vision. Beautiful. Doomed.

She moved to her vanity station, a floating disc of brushed platinum that hummed with dormant technology. She sat gracefully, meeting her own reflection in the mirror's surface—dark eyes that revealed nothing, the ceremonial gold paint still marking her cheekbones and brow. Her fingers found the neural interface embedded in the vanity's edge, and she began the performance of evening ritual. Removing the pins from her elaborate coiffure. Wiping away the gold with a cloth that came away stained like old blood.

All the while, her mind worked behind the mask of her face.

Her grandmother had taught her the surveillance patterns long ago—the frequencies of the sweeps, the blind spots, the maintenance windows. Old Antu's mother, who understood that even princesses needed shadows to hide their secrets.

Inanna pressed her thumb to a hidden sensor beneath the vanity's lip. The mirror's surface flickered, then displayed what appeared to be a cosmetics inventory. But her eyes tracked the secondary data stream embedded in the color codes—the surveillance schedule, the guard rotations, the maintenance windows.

*Six hours until the next deep-scan sweep.*

Her father's warning had compressed everything. She couldn't wait three days. Couldn't even wait until tomorrow. If she was going to act, it had to be tonight.

She retrieved the data chip her mother had given her at the celebration and inserted it into the neural port behind her ear. Information flooded her consciousness—coordinates resolving in her mind. A location deep in the Amazon Basin, far from any known Anunnaki installation. Far from the flood zones that would soon swallow the coastal settlements. Far from the death her father had decreed.

Additional data scrolled past: Earth's geography unfurling in her mind's eye. Mountain ranges and river systems. The locations of the labor camps and the wild zones beyond them. Climate patterns, predator distributions, plant species that could sustain Anunnaki physiology in emergency conditions. Her mother had been gathering this for years—perhaps decades. Preparing for a moment she'd hoped would never come.

*How long has she been planning this? How long has she been waiting for me to be ready?*

Inanna pulled up the station's hangar manifest next, cross-referencing with the maintenance schedules. The royal barges were too conspicuous, too heavily monitored. The military cruisers required crew complements and authorization codes she couldn't fake. But there—a reconnaissance pod designated for atmospheric sampling, scheduled for routine maintenance in Bay Seventeen.

Bay Seventeen. Lightly staffed. A maintenance window in six hours that would leave only two technicians on duty.

She memorized the pod's specifications, its fuel capacity, its atmospheric entry protocols. It was small, barely large enough for a single occupant, designed for short-range scientific missions. The journey to Earth's surface would push its capabilities to their limits.

*Good,* she thought grimly. *Let them think no one would be foolish enough to attempt it.*

She rose and crossed to the sleeping alcove, where gossamer curtains of woven light created the illusion of privacy. Beneath the bed's hovering mass, invisible to casual inspection, a small panel responded to the specific bioelectric signature of her palm. It slid open with a sound like a held breath releasing.

The hidden compartment contained her true treasures: a protein synthesizer small enough to fit in her closed fist, and a knife. The knife was an antique, its blade forged from Nibiran steel before the Great Expansion, its handle wrapped in leather that had come from Earth itself—a gift from her mother on her naming day, centuries ago.

*"The blade remembers,"* Antu had said then, pressing it into her daughter's small hands. *"Even when we forget, the blade remembers what we were before we became gods."*

The same words, echoed across centuries. Her mother had been preparing her for this moment longer than Inanna had ever realized.

She changed out of her ceremonial gown, replacing it with the close-fitting tactical suit she'd hidden in the back of her wardrobe. Dark fabric that would absorb light rather than reflect it. Boots with magnetic soles and impact-absorbing treads. A cloak with thermal masking woven into its fibers.

She looked at herself in the mirror—not a princess now, but something else. Something that had no name in the Anunnaki lexicon.

*Traitor,* her father would call her.
*Fool,* her half-brother would sneer.
*Dead,* the court would pronounce, once they realized she was gone.

But as she secured the knife against her thigh and slipped the protein synthesizer into her belt pouch, Inanna felt something she hadn't experienced in centuries. Not fear—she'd lived with fear for so long it had become background noise. Not hope—hope was too fragile a word for what stirred in her chest.

*Purpose.*

She had six hours until the maintenance window. Six hours to finalize her route through the station's corridors, to prepare the diversions that would draw attention away from Bay Seventeen, to say goodbye to everything she'd ever known.

Six hours until she became the first Anunnaki in recorded history to commit treason for the sake of creatures her people considered less than animals.

The coordinates pulsed in her mind like a second heartbeat—her mother's gift, her destination, her chance.

*The jungle remembers,* her mother had said.

*Then let the jungle remember me too.*

**Scene 5: Flight into Darkness**

The corridor stretched before Inanna like a throat of darkness, swallowing the faint blue emergency lighting that pulsed along its ribbed walls. She pressed herself against the cold metal, her bare feet silent on the grated floor. The royal slippers she'd discarded three sections back—too soft, too likely to whisper against the steel.

*Breathe. Count. Move.*

She'd helped design these security protocols when she was barely past her first century, a princess playing at engineering while her tutors indulged her curiosity. Now that childhood game might save her life.

The scanner node ahead hummed with dormant energy, its crystalline eye cycling through spectral frequencies. Inanna counted the rhythm—three seconds of ultraviolet sweep, two seconds of thermal, one second of darkness as the system reset. She'd argued for eliminating that gap. Her father had called it an acceptable inefficiency.

*One. Two. Three.*

She slipped through the dead zone, her heart hammering against her ribs like something caged and desperate to escape.

Bay Seventeen was a forgotten limb of the station, relegated to maintenance craft and emergency pods after the grand docking facilities were constructed on the station's sunward face. Dust motes drifted in the recycled air, catching the amber glow of standby lights. The space smelled of lubricant and old ozone—the scent of machines waiting to be remembered.

Inanna's eyes found the pod immediately. A Descent-class vessel, compact and unremarkable, designed for atmospheric entry rather than combat or comfort. Its hull bore the scratches of a hundred routine missions, its designation number half-worn away: *D-7.*

*My chariot to exile.*

She crossed the hangar floor in quick, measured steps. The pod's access panel glowed to life at her touch, recognizing the genetic signature she couldn't hide. For a moment, Inanna froze, waiting for alarms, for guards, for the heavy hand of her half-brother on her shoulder. Nothing came but the soft hiss of the hatch unsealing.

Inside, the cockpit embraced her with familiar geometry—control interfaces designed for Anunnaki hands, screens that flickered to life with eager luminescence. She slid into the pilot's cradle, her fingers dancing across the startup sequence with muscle memory she didn't know she possessed.

*Atmospheric processors: online.*
*Navigation systems: calibrating.*
*Descent trajectory: calculating.*

Earth hung in the viewport like a jewel suspended in void, its surface swirled with white and blue and the deep green of continents that would soon drown. From here, she could almost pretend it was simply beautiful—not a death sentence waiting to be executed.

"Forgive me," she whispered to no one, to everyone. To the fifteen million souls who didn't know they had days left to live. "I'm coming."

The launch sequence initiated with a subsonic thrum that vibrated through her bones. The hangar's emergency doors began their ponderous slide, revealing the star-scattered darkness beyond.

Then the alarms screamed.

Red light flooded the cockpit, strobing in rhythm with a klaxon that seemed to pierce directly into her brain. The hangar doors shuddered, their motion reversing as override commands flooded the system.

"Princess Inanna." The voice crackled through the pod's communication system, cold and unsurprised. "I must confess, I expected this. Father's faith in your performance was touching, but I know you better than he does."

Enlil.

Her blood turned to ice water in her veins. On the secondary display, she could see security forces flooding into the hangar, their weapons raised, their faces hidden behind tactical visors.

"Brother." She forced her voice to remain steady, her hands never pausing in their work across the controls. "I didn't realize you cared enough to see me off personally."

"I care about the integrity of our mission." His tone carried no warmth, no familial recognition. "About the security of our people. You've always been sentimental, Inanna. It was charming when you were young. Now it's simply dangerous."

"If you knew I would attempt this, why wait? Why let me reach the hangar at all?"

"Because Father wanted to believe your tears. Wanted to believe his precious daughter had truly submitted. I knew better—but I also knew he needed to see you fail with his own eyes. Now there can be no mercy, no second chances. You've damned yourself beyond any doubt."

The hangar doors had stopped, half-open—a gap just wide enough for a skilled pilot, just narrow enough to be suicidal.

"You could still let me go." She was bargaining now, buying seconds while the pod's engines built toward launch capacity. "Tell them I overpowered the guards, stole the vessel before you could respond. I'll disappear. You'll never have to explain my sympathies to the council."

"And allow contaminated bloodlines to pollute our genetic legacy?" Enlil's voice hardened. "No, sister. You'll be returned to Father, and you'll watch from confinement as we cleanse that world. Perhaps then you'll understand why attachment to lesser species is a disease that must be purged."

The soldiers were at the pod now, magnetic clamps extending toward the hull. In moments, they would lock her in place, and everything—the warnings, the desperate hope, the faces of those human children she'd watched grow from orbit—would mean nothing.

*No.*

Inanna's hand slammed down on the emergency launch override.

The pod screamed forward, tearing free of the clamps with a shriek of protesting metal. The gap in the hangar doors rushed toward her, a sliver of salvation framed in steel. She felt the scrape of the hull against the door's edge, heard the groan of alloys never meant to touch, and then—

Silence. Stars. The infinite embrace of vacuum.

Behind her, the station dwindled, its lights angry and red, its pursuit craft already launching from the primary hangar. Ahead, Earth grew larger with each passing second, its atmosphere a thin blue line of promise and danger.

"You've made your choice, Inanna." Enlil's voice cut through the static, harder now, stripped of even the pretense of familial connection. "When we find you—and we will find you—you will face the full weight of Anunnaki justice. There will be no mercy. No recognition of blood. You are no longer a princess. You are simply a traitor."

She killed the communication link with a savage jab.

The pod shuddered as it caught the first whispers of atmosphere, heat building against the forward shields. Warning indicators flashed—damage from her desperate escape, systems operating beyond safe parameters. The craft wanted to shake itself apart, and Inanna fought the controls with every ounce of strength she possessed.

*Terror.* It coursed through her like electricity, primal and absolute. She was falling toward a world she'd only ever observed from safety, hunted by her own people, carrying knowledge that could save millions or damn her forever.

*Exhilaration.* She was free. For the first time in her centuries of existence, no protocol bound her, no expectation shaped her, no royal obligation weighed upon her shoulders. She was simply Inanna—falling, burning, choosing.

*Commitment.* There was no return now. The woman who had been a princess of the Anunnaki Empire died somewhere in the space between the station and the atmosphere. Whatever emerged from this fire would be something new, something forged in the crucible of betrayal and hope.

The pursuit craft appeared on her sensors, closing fast, their weapons systems charging. She had minutes at most before they achieved weapons lock.

But minutes were enough.

Earth's atmosphere wrapped around her pod like a lover's arms, and Inanna plunged toward the world she had chosen to save—or die trying to reach.

Behind her, the stars grew distant, and her old life burned away in trails of superheated plasma.

The jungle waited below, ancient and patient, ready to remember.
