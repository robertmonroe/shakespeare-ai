## Chapter 1: The Weight of What Remains

**Scene 1: Marcus sits on his bedroom flo...**

**Scene 1: Marcus sits on his bedroom floor**

The acceptance letters made a perfect circle around Marcus, their thick cream envelopes still sealed, still promising futures he couldn't imagine. Seven of them now. The latest had arrived yesterday—University of Southern Maine, his mom's favorite because it was close. She'd left it on his desk with a hopeful smile he'd pretended not to see.

Marcus leaned back against his bed frame, the afternoon light slanting through his window in dusty gold bars. Outside, the early April wind carried the salt-sharp smell of the ocean two blocks away, mixing with the softer scent of mud and awakening earth. Spring in Copper's Cove always smelled like possibility. Like starting over.

Through the window, he watched Copper at the bottom of the porch steps.

The old golden retriever stood very still, his head lowered, considering the three wooden stairs like they were a mountain. His fur, once the color of new pennies, had faded to something closer to tarnished brass, especially around his muzzle where gray had crept in like frost.

*Come on, boy.*

Copper placed one paw on the first step. His back leg trembled with the effort of lifting his weight. He made it up, paused, then tried for the second step.

His leg buckled.

Marcus's hand pressed flat against the cold windowpane before he realized he'd moved. His breath fogged the glass.

Copper steadied himself, shook once—that old familiar shake that used to spray water everywhere after beach runs—but now just looked like an old dog trying to resettle bones that didn't fit right anymore. He tried again. Failed again.

The third attempt, Copper made it. All three steps, one careful paw at a time, until he collapsed on the porch with a heavy sigh Marcus couldn't hear but knew by heart.

Something crinkled in Marcus's jacket pocket.

He pulled out the business card without meaning to—Dr. Sarah Chen, Coastal Veterinary Services, the edges already soft from two weeks of his thumb worrying the corners. Her direct number was written on the back in her neat handwriting, below four words: *When you're ready. —Sarah*

Marcus stared at it. The letters seemed to pulse in his peripheral vision, all those unopened futures arranged like a ritual circle, like they were waiting for something. Like they knew.

His phone buzzed. Mom: *Leftover lasagna in the fridge. Working late. Love you.*

He shoved the card back in his pocket, deep, where he wouldn't feel it against his ribs every time he breathed.

Outside, Copper had made it to his favorite spot on the porch—the corner where the sun hit longest in the afternoon, where he'd spent ten years watching for Marcus to come home. The dog turned three times, slower than he used to, before settling down with his nose on his paws.

Ten years. A third of Marcus's life. All of it without Dad.

Marcus pulled his knees to his chest, the acceptance letters crinkling under his shifting weight. Boston University. Northeastern. University of Vermont. All of them wanted him. All of them waiting for an answer he couldn't give, because answering meant choosing, and choosing meant leaving, and leaving meant—

His throat tightened.

Through the window, Copper's sides rose and fell with the deep breathing of sleep. Even from here, Marcus could see the way his back leg twitched, chasing something in dreams. Rabbits, probably. Or the tennis ball Dad used to throw into the waves, the one Copper would retrieve over and over until his legs gave out from joy, not pain.

The vet's card felt like a stone in his pocket.

Marcus stood abruptly, scattering the acceptance letters. They slid across the hardwood floor like autumn leaves, their careful circle broken. He grabbed his jacket from the bedpost and headed for the door, then stopped.

On his desk sat an old shoebox, the kind that had held his first pair of school sneakers. He'd kept it all these years, pushed to the back of his closet, pulled out only when the missing got too heavy to carry alone.

His hand hovered over the lid.

Not yet. Not today.

But tomorrow, maybe. Tomorrow they could go back to Serpent's Cove. Just one more time. One last—

Marcus closed his eyes, shutting down the thought before it could finish itself.

Outside, Copper slept on, dreaming of better days, while the afternoon light began its slow fade toward evening.

**Scene 2: Marcus's mother knocks on his ...**

**Scene 2: Marcus's mother knocks on his door**

The knock came soft, almost apologetic—three gentle taps that Marcus had learned to recognize over the years. His mother never barged in anymore, not since he'd turned thirteen and started closing his door.

"Come in," he said, not looking up from the acceptance letter he'd been pretending to read for the past twenty minutes.

The hinges creaked, a sound as familiar as the rhythm of waves against the rocks below town. His mother stepped inside carrying a basket of folded laundry, the scent of lavender detergent trailing behind her. Marcus watched from his peripheral vision as she paused just inside the doorway, her eyes sweeping across the scattered envelopes that littered his floor like autumn leaves.

She didn't say anything about them. She never did.

Instead, she moved to his dresser and began putting away clothes with practiced efficiency—socks in the top drawer, t-shirts in the second. The silence stretched between them, not uncomfortable exactly, but weighted with all the things neither of them wanted to say.

Copper lifted his head from his bed by the window, tail thumping twice against the floor in greeting before settling back down with a soft groan. The sound made Marcus's chest tighten.

"I made pot roast," his mother said finally, smoothing down a folded flannel shirt. "Your favorite."

"Thanks, Mom."

She closed the drawer and turned to face him, leaning against the dresser with her arms crossed loosely over her chest. In the amber light filtering through his window, Marcus could see the gray threading through her dark hair, the fine lines around her eyes that hadn't been there ten years ago. She wore one of Dad's old Bowdoin College sweatshirts, the navy blue faded to something softer.

"You know," she began, her voice careful, "Dr. Morrison called today. She said she hasn't heard from us about Copper's appointment."

Marcus's fingers tightened on the letter in his hands, crinkling the heavy paper. "I've been busy."

"I know." She moved to sit on the edge of his bed, close enough that he could smell her familiar scent—coffee and the hand cream she always used, the one that came in the green tin. "But honey, he's been having a hard time with the stairs. And yesterday, when I came home, he hadn't touched his breakfast."

"He ate it eventually."

"Marcus."

The way she said his name—gentle but firm, the same tone she'd used when he was seven and trying to convince her that Copper could sleep in his bed despite the no-dogs-on-furniture rule—made him finally look up at her.

Her eyes were the same warm brown as his own, and they held a sadness that he recognized because he felt it too. But there was something else there: acceptance. Understanding. The quiet strength she'd developed in the years since Dad died, when she'd had to be strong enough for both of them.

"I'm taking him to Serpent's Cove," Marcus said suddenly. "Tomorrow. One last hike."

His mother's expression shifted, surprise flickering across her features before settling into something more complex. She glanced at Copper, who had dozed off again, his chest rising and falling in the steady rhythm of sleep.

"Serpent's Cove," she repeated softly. "That's a long walk, sweetheart. Are you sure he can make it?"

"We'll go slow. Take breaks." Marcus set down the letter and pulled his knees up to his chest. "I just... I need to do this, Mom. Before—"

He couldn't finish the sentence. Didn't need to.

His mother was quiet for a long moment, her gaze drifting to the window where the evening sun painted everything in shades of gold and amber. Outside, a gull cried, its call echoing across the cove that gave their town its name.

"Your father loved that place," she said finally.

"I know."

"You were so small when we scattered the ashes. I wasn't sure you'd remember."

"I remember everything about that day." Marcus's voice came out rougher than he intended. "Copper kept trying to chase the seagulls, and you laughed for the first time in weeks. And Dad's ashes caught the wind and scattered over the water like—like snow."

His mother's eyes glistened, but she didn't look away. "He would have wanted this. One last adventure."

Something in Marcus's throat loosened, just a fraction. "Yeah?"

"Yeah." She reached over and squeezed his hand, her fingers warm and familiar. "But Marcus, when you come back—"

"I know." He squeezed back, then let go. "I know, Mom."

She stood, smoothing down her sweatshirt, and picked up the empty laundry basket. At the door, she paused and looked back at him, at Copper sleeping peacefully in the fading light, at the college letters that represented futures neither of them had discussed.

"Dinner's in an hour," she said. "And Marcus? Take the blue backpack from the garage. It's got better padding than your school one. For the hike."

After she left, Marcus sat in the gathering dusk, listening to Copper's breathing and the distant sound of his mother moving around the kitchen below. The house settled around him with its familiar creaks and sighs, the old bones of a place that had held his family through joy and grief and everything in between.

Through the window, he could just make out the dark line of the coast, the place where land met sea. Somewhere beyond the harbor, past the lighthouse and the rocky beaches, Serpent's Cove waited—that hidden stretch of shoreline where the cliffs curved like a sleeping serpent and the water ran deep and cold.

Tomorrow, he and Copper would make the journey one last time.

Tonight, Marcus would let himself believe that tomorrow would never have to end.

**Scene 3: After his mother leaves, Marcu...**

**Scene 3: After his mother leaves, Marcus kneels beside Copper on the floor**

The click of the front door echoed through the house, followed by the muffled sound of his mother's car starting in the driveway. Marcus waited until the engine noise faded before he finally moved, his knees protesting as he shifted from sitting to kneeling beside Copper.

The dog's tail thumped twice against the hardwood floor—a slower rhythm than it used to be, but still there. Still trying.

"Hey, boy," Marcus whispered, running his hands through the thick fur at Copper's neck. His fingers found the familiar patches where the golden coat had faded to white, spreading from his muzzle up toward his ears like frost creeping across a window. When had that happened? It seemed like just yesterday Copper's fur had been uniformly gold, so bright it seemed to catch sunlight even indoors.

Copper's brown eyes found his, and Marcus felt that familiar tightness in his chest—the one that had lived there for ten years, since the morning everything changed.

He reached for the desk drawer without looking, muscle memory guiding his hand to the back corner where he kept the things too precious to leave out but too painful to look at often. The blue bandana was exactly where he'd left it, folded into a small square, the fabric soft and worn from years of washing and wear.

Marcus held it to his nose. It didn't smell like his father anymore—hadn't for years—but the gesture was automatic, hopeful. Instead, it carried the faint scent of dog and salt air and something indefinably *before*.

"Do you remember the day we got you?" Marcus asked, unfolding the bandana across his palm. Copper's ears perked slightly at the sound of his voice. "I was seven. Dad took me to the farm out on Route 1, the one with the red barn."

The memory surfaced with startling clarity: September sunshine, the smell of hay and puppy breath, his small hands struggling to hold a wiggling ball of golden fur. There had been six puppies in the litter, but Copper had been the one to stumble over to Marcus first, tripping over his own too-big paws, pink tongue already trying to lick Marcus's face.

His father had laughed—that deep, rumbling laugh that Marcus sometimes struggled to remember now, despite the videos his mother kept on her phone. "I think he's chosen you, Marcus."

"Can we really keep him, Dad? Really?"

"Every boy needs a dog." His father had knelt down beside him, one large hand steadying the puppy while the other ruffled Marcus's hair. "And every dog needs a boy. Looks like you two found each other."

They'd stopped at the hardware store on the way home—Marcus could still picture the layout, the creaky wooden floors, the smell of paint and motor oil. His father had let him pick out supplies: a red collar, a silver food bowl, a rope toy. And the bandana, blue as the ocean on a clear day.

"Every adventure needs a good companion," his father had said, tying the bandana around the puppy's neck with careful fingers. It had been comically large then, hanging down to Copper's chest. The puppy had immediately tried to chew on it, making them both laugh.

Three months later, Marcus had stood in this same bedroom, clutching that same puppy—no longer quite so small—while downstairs, paramedics worked on his father's still form in the kitchen. He'd heard his mother's voice, high and desperate. Heard the radio chatter and heavy footsteps and the terrible, endless silence that followed.

Copper had licked the tears from his face then, too. Had pressed close and warm against Marcus's chest while the world shattered around them.

Marcus blinked hard, bringing himself back to the present. His fingers had been absently stroking Copper's head, tracing the familiar shape of his skull, the soft spots behind his ears. The dog's eyes had drifted half-closed, content despite the stiffness Marcus could feel in his joints, the slight tremor in his back leg.

"You've been with me through everything, haven't you?" Marcus's voice cracked. "Every birthday. Every first day of school. Every—" He stopped, swallowed. "Every time I needed you."

Copper shifted, resting his graying muzzle on Marcus's knee. The weight was lighter than it used to be. When had his dog gotten so thin?

Marcus carefully tied the bandana around Copper's neck, his hands steadier than his heart. It fit perfectly now, faded and frayed at the edges but still holding together. Still here.

Just like them.

He glanced at the window, where afternoon light was beginning to slant across the porch. The acceptance letters lay scattered behind him, forgotten. There would be time for those later—time for decisions about futures and colleges and all the things that waited beyond this moment.

Right now, there was only this: a boy and his dog, and one last adventure to plan.

Marcus stood slowly, his knees popping, and moved to his closet. The old hiking backpack hung on its usual hook, dusty but serviceable. He pulled it down and set it on the bed, then paused, looking back at Copper.

The dog was watching him with those knowing eyes, the bandana bright against his faded fur.

"Serpent's Cove," Marcus said softly. "One more time. What do you say, boy?"

Copper's tail thumped against the floor—once, twice, three times.

It was enough.

**Scene 4: Marcus begins packing his back...**

**Scene 4: Marcus begins packing his backpack for the journey to Serpent's Cove**

Marcus pulled his old hiking backpack from the closet, the canvas still stiff with salt residue from last summer's coastal trails. He set it on his bed, the acceptance letters pushed aside without ceremony, and stared at the empty main compartment like it was a question he didn't know how to answer.

What do you bring on a last journey?

He started with the practical things. Water bottle. First aid kit. His phone, though service at Serpent's Cove was spotty at best. But those weren't what mattered.

From the top drawer of his desk, Marcus retrieved the Ziploc bag of Copper's favorite treats—the expensive peanut butter ones from the specialty pet store in Portland. His mom had stopped buying them months ago when Copper's appetite started to fade, but Marcus had kept a secret stash. He turned the bag over in his hands, feeling the soft crumble of biscuits inside, and remembered the way Copper used to dance on his hind legs for just one.

*Seventh grade. Marcus's first dance. He'd spent twenty minutes in front of the mirror trying to fix his hair before giving up and collapsing on the floor beside Copper's bed. "I can't do this," he'd whispered into golden fur. Copper had simply rested his chin on Marcus's knee, then gently pawed at his pocket—the one with the treats. Making Marcus laugh when he'd been certain he'd forgotten how.*

The bag went into the backpack's side pocket.

Next, Marcus knelt beside his bed and reached underneath, his fingers finding the shoebox he kept there. Inside, wrapped in an old t-shirt, was the tennis ball. Once bright yellow, now cracked and faded to the color of old parchment. The felt was worn smooth on one side, completely missing on the other, revealing the rubber underneath.

He held it up to the afternoon light streaming through his window. Copper lifted his head from his bed in the corner, ears perking slightly at the familiar shape.

"Remember this, boy?"

Copper's tail gave a single, weak thump.

*The backyard, ten springs ago. Marcus's dad tossing the ball in a high arc, and Copper—still just a puppy, all paws and enthusiasm—tumbling over himself trying to catch it. Missing. Trying again. The ball had rolled under the porch, and seven-year-old Marcus had crawled after it, emerging covered in cobwebs and dirt, triumphant. "Again!" he'd shouted. "Again!"*

*They'd played until the sun set. It was the last game of fetch his father ever threw.*

Marcus's throat tightened. He placed the ball carefully in the backpack's top compartment where it wouldn't get crushed.

The bandana was harder to find. He knew it was in his room somewhere—he'd seen it recently, hadn't he? Marcus opened drawer after drawer, moving through the archaeology of his teenage years. Old birthday cards. A dried corsage from junior prom. Sarah's hair tie, the purple one she'd left on his desk after study sessions and never asked for back.

He found the bandana folded at the bottom of his memory box, beneath the program from his father's funeral. Blue as a summer sky, soft from a hundred washings. His dad had tied it around Copper's neck the day they brought the puppy home.

"So everyone knows he's ours," his father had said, kneeling to adjust the fabric. "So he knows he belongs."

Marcus brought the bandana to his face. It didn't smell like anything anymore—not his father's cologne, not Copper's warm fur. Just the neutral scent of old cotton. But when he closed his eyes, he could feel his father's hands guiding his seven-year-old fingers through the knot, teaching him how to tie it just right.

*Middle school. Eighth grade. Tyler Brennan and his friends cornering Marcus by the bike racks, shoving him, calling him names he'd tried hard to forget. Walking home with a bloody nose and a ripped backpack. Copper had been waiting on the porch like always, but that day he'd done something different—followed Marcus to school the next morning, keeping pace twenty feet behind. Sat outside the building all day. Walked Marcus home. Did it again the next day, and the next, until Tyler got the message that Marcus wasn't alone.*

*Marcus had tied the blue bandana around Copper's neck every morning that week. Armor. Protection. Love made visible.*

"You've always been there," Marcus whispered to the empty room.

From his bed in the corner, Copper made a soft sound—not quite a whine, not quite a sigh.

Marcus crossed to him, knelt down, and carefully tied the bandana around Copper's neck. His fingers fumbled with the knot. When had Copper gotten so thin? The bandana hung loose, the way it had when he was still a puppy.

"One more adventure," Marcus said, scratching behind Copper's graying ears. "Just you and me. Like always."

Copper's dark eyes met his, and Marcus saw something there he recognized—the same quiet understanding that had gotten him through nightmares and bad days, through the anniversary of his father's death every year, through the terrifying vulnerability of falling in love with Sarah Chen.

*Last month. Sitting on this same floor, phone in hand, trying to work up the courage to text Sarah back. "I don't know what to say," he'd told Copper. "What if I mess it up?" Copper had simply rested his head on Marcus's lap, patient and steady. Marcus had typed the message. Sarah had said yes to coffee. Then yes to a movie. Then yes to the junior prom. Copper had been there for all of it, listening to Marcus rehearse conversations, accepting tribute treats when dates went well, offering silent comfort when they didn't.*

Marcus zipped the backpack closed and checked his watch. Three-thirty. They had maybe four hours of good daylight left, enough time to reach Serpent's Cove if they moved slowly.

When they moved slowly.

He shouldered the pack and turned back to Copper, who was watching him with that knowing expression—the one that said he understood exactly where they were going and why.

"Ready, boy?"

Copper stood, shakier than Marcus wanted to acknowledge, and took a careful step forward.

Then another.

Together, they headed for the door.

**Scene 5: As darkness falls, Marcus sits...**

As darkness falls, Marcus sits on the edge of his bed, the last remnants of twilight bleeding through his window in shades of purple and gray. The house has grown quiet around him—his mother's footsteps stopped echoing down the hallway an hour ago, and even the usual creak of settling floorboards has faded into silence.

The acceptance letters still lie scattered across the floor where he left them, white envelopes against dark wood like fallen leaves. All afternoon he'd stepped around them, pretended they didn't exist, but now one catches what little light remains. The return address is embossed, formal: University of Maine, Orono. His father's school.

Marcus reaches down and picks it up. The envelope is heavier than the others, thicker. His fingers find the seal, and for a moment he just holds it there, feeling the weight of what's inside. The weight of a future he's supposed to want.

He tears it open.

The letter unfolds with a whisper of expensive paper. *Congratulations...* The word seems to float at the top of the page. *...pleased to offer you admission...* His eyes skim over phrases about academic excellence and community values, words that should mean something, words that probably would have made his father proud.

A rasping breath pulls his attention to the floor.

Copper lies on the braided rug beside the bed, the one that's been his spot since he was a puppy too small to jump up on the mattress. But there's nothing small about him now—just old, his golden fur faded to cream, his body rising and falling with breaths that sound like they cost something.

Marcus watches his ribs expand, contract. Expand. A pause that lasts too long. Contract.

"Hey, boy," he whispers.

Copper's tail thumps once against the floor, but he doesn't lift his head. His eyes open, though—still brown, still warm, still the same eyes that watched Marcus cry himself to sleep for months after the funeral, that never judged, never asked for explanations.

Marcus sets the letter on his nightstand and slides down to the floor, crossing his legs beside Copper's rug. He rests one hand on the dog's shoulder, feeling the warmth of him, the realness. Copper's breathing evens out slightly at the touch, and Marcus thinks about all the nights this dog has slept beside him, all the mornings he's woken to find a wet nose pressed against his cheek.

The vet's business card is still in his jeans pocket. He can feel its sharp corner digging into his thigh.

His mother's words from this morning drift back: *I know it's hard, sweetheart. But we have to think about what's best for him.*

Marcus knows what she meant. What she's been trying to say for weeks now without actually saying it. The same thing Dr. Peterson implied during their last visit, her gentle hands examining Copper's hips, her careful questions about his quality of life.

But they don't understand. They can't. Copper isn't just a dog.

He's the last piece of his father that still breathes.

Marcus looks at the acceptance letter on his nightstand, then back at Copper. The future and the past, both waiting for him to choose.

"Tomorrow," he says quietly, his hand moving to scratch behind Copper's ears the way he's done ten thousand times before. "Tomorrow we're going to Serpent's Cove. Just you and me. Like we used to."

Copper's tail moves again, a slow sweep across the rug.

"It's going to be a long walk. Three hours, maybe more." Marcus's throat tightens. "But we'll take our time. We'll stop whenever you need to. And when we get there..." He pauses, picturing the rocky shore, the tide pools where his father's ashes disappeared into the sea. "When we get there, we'll figure out what comes next."

The dog shifts, turning his head to look up at Marcus with those knowing eyes. For a moment, Marcus swears he understands—understands that this isn't just another hike, that something is ending and something else is trying to begin.

Marcus lies down on the floor beside him, not caring about the hardness of the wood or the chill seeping up through the boards. He curls himself around Copper's warmth, his face pressed into the soft fur of his neck, breathing in the familiar smell of him: grass and salt air and something uniquely, perfectly Copper.

"One last adventure," Marcus whispers into the darkness. "Then I'll be ready."

He doesn't say for what. He doesn't have to.

Outside, the wind picks up off the ocean, rattling his window in its frame. The moon rises somewhere beyond the clouds, invisible but present, pulling at the tides the way time pulls at everything else.

Marcus closes his eyes and listens to Copper breathe, counting each inhale like a gift, and somewhere in the rhythm of it, he finally falls asleep.
