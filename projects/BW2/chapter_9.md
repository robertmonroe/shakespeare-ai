## Chapter 9: The Oligarch's Web

**Scene 1: Max arrives at Vershinsky's sp...**

**Scene 1: Max arrives at Vershinsky's sprawling villa**

The Uber dropped Max at the bottom of the hill, exactly as instructed. No civilian vehicles beyond this point—that much was clear from the discreet signage in Spanish, English, and Russian. Max adjusted his Tom Ford jacket and began the walk up the private road, his Italian leather shoes crunching on pristine gravel.

The Mediterranean sun beat down on his shoulders, but the heat didn't account for the prickle of sweat at the base of his neck. Three hundred meters ahead, the villa rose like a modernist fortress against the Catalan sky—all white stone, glass, and geometric precision. Beautiful and impenetrable.

The first checkpoint appeared after fifty meters. A guardhouse painted to blend with the landscape, though the two men inside made no attempt at subtlety. Eastern European faces, military bearing, earpieces trailing down their necks. One stepped out, hand resting casually near his hip.

"Passport, please." The accent was thick, the English functional.

Max handed over his Canadian documentation—the venture capitalist identity he'd been living for three weeks. The guard scanned it with a handheld device while his partner watched Max through the guardhouse window, unsmiling.

"Purpose of visit?"

"Business meeting with Mr. Vershinsky. I'm expected."

The device beeped. The guard studied the screen, then Max's face, then the screen again. Finally, a curt nod. "Continue. Next checkpoint, one hundred meters."

Max walked on, counting his steps, noting the cameras embedded in the olive trees that lined the road. High-end equipment, probably thermal imaging in addition to visual. The property's perimeter fence was visible through the vegetation—three meters high, topped with sensors rather than the crude simplicity of razor wire. Money whispered where poverty shouted.

The second checkpoint was more thorough. A metal detector, a pat-down that found his phone and wallet but nothing else, because there was nothing else to find. Max had left everything tactical in the Barcelona safe house. Today he was just a Canadian investor with too much money and too few scruples.

"Arms up, please." A female guard ran a wand over him with professional efficiency. Her eyes never met his. Behind her, two more guards watched from positions that gave them clear firing lines with no crossfire risk. These people knew what they were doing.

"Clear."

The road opened up, and the villa revealed itself in full. Max had seen the satellite imagery, but photos didn't capture the aggressive luxury of the place. Infinity pools terraced down the hillside. Sculpture gardens featuring pieces Max recognized from auction catalogs—originals worth millions. A helipad with a gleaming Eurocopter. The main house itself sprawled across the hilltop, floor-to-ceiling windows reflecting the cloudless sky like a mirror.

A golf cart hummed up the drive, piloted by a young man in a crisp white shirt.

"Mr. Monroe? Please, come with me."

Max climbed in, using the ride to continue his assessment. Exit routes: the main road he'd come up, a service road visible on the eastern side, the helicopter for those with access. The property backed onto protected parkland—good for escape, bad for extraction. The security presence was heavy but not overwhelming. Vershinsky felt safe here, confident in his fortress.

That confidence would be his weakness.

The cart stopped at the main entrance, where a woman in an elegant black suit waited. Her smile was professional, her eyes were not.

"Welcome to Villa Meridiana, Mr. Monroe. I am Svetlana, Mr. Vershinsky's personal assistant." Her English was flawless, accent barely detectable. "Mr. Vershinsky is concluding a call. He will join you shortly on the terrace. Please, follow me."

They passed through an entrance hall that belonged in a museum—marble floors, a Chagall on one wall, a Kandinsky on another. The air conditioning was arctic, the silence absolute except for the click of Svetlana's heels.

Max's operational mind catalogued everything: security panel by the door, motion sensors in the corners, pressure plates under the rugs. The house was a vault that happened to have bedrooms.

Svetlana led him through French doors onto a terrace that overlooked the Mediterranean. The view was staggering—azure water stretching to the horizon, sailboats like white triangles in the distance, Barcelona's skyline hazy to the south.

"Please, make yourself comfortable. May I bring you something to drink?"

"Sparkling water would be perfect."

She disappeared back inside, leaving Max alone with the view and his thoughts. He moved to the terrace edge, hands in pockets, playing the part of a man admiring the scenery while actually checking sight lines and calculating distances.

A voice behind him, warm and cultured: "Magnificent, isn't it? I never tire of it."

Max turned.

Mikhail Vershinsky stood in the doorway, backlit by the house's interior. Tall, silver-haired, wearing linen trousers and a silk shirt unbuttoned at the collar. He looked like a man on vacation, not a former KGB officer who'd built an empire on the bones of the Soviet Union.

His smile was genuine. His eyes were not.

"Mr. Monroe," Vershinsky said, extending his hand. "Welcome to my home."

**Scene 2: Max is escorted to a terrace o...**

**Scene 2: Max is escorted to a terrace overlooking the sea**

The security officer led Max through a corridor lined with contemporary art—a Basquiat, what looked like an early Hockney, a sculpture that might have been a genuine Giacometti. The casual display of wealth was a statement in itself: *I possess what others merely admire in museums.*

They emerged onto a terrace that seemed to float above the Mediterranean. The afternoon sun painted the water in shades of cobalt and gold, and a warm breeze carried the scent of salt and jasmine. White furniture arranged in conversational clusters suggested civilized discourse, though the discreet cameras mounted at intervals reminded Max that every word would be recorded.

"Mr. Monroe." The voice was cultured, touched with an accent that had been softened by years in the West but never fully erased. "Welcome."

Mikhail Vershinsky rose from a chair positioned to command the best view. He was in his early sixties, trim and elegant in linen trousers and a crisp white shirt open at the collar. His silver hair was swept back from a face that might have belonged to a diplomat or university professor—distinguished features, intelligent eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses, the suggestion of a smile playing at the corners of his mouth.

But Max had studied the file. He knew what those hands had done in the final years of the Soviet Union, the bodies that had disappeared, the fortunes that had been seized when the old order collapsed and men like Vershinsky had positioned themselves to catch the falling pieces.

"Thank you for seeing me," Max said, accepting the firm handshake. The grip was measured, confident—a man who had nothing to prove but wanted you to know he could prove it anyway.

"Please, sit." Vershinsky gestured to a chair. "You'll join me for wine? I have a 2010 Pingus that is drinking beautifully."

A server materialized—one of the silent staff Max had noticed throughout the villa—and poured ruby liquid into crystal glasses. Max noticed Mariana standing near the terrace's edge, her posture perfect, her expression unreadable. She wore a cream-colored dress that moved with the breeze, and her dark hair was pulled back to reveal the elegant line of her neck. She hadn't acknowledged Max's arrival.

"To new opportunities," Vershinsky said, raising his glass. The wine was extraordinary, complex and rich, probably worth more than Max's monthly salary.

"Your home is remarkable," Max said, playing his role.

"A refuge." Vershinsky settled back into his chair with the ease of a man completely comfortable in his domain. "I've always believed that beauty feeds the soul. Don't you agree, Mariana?"

She turned, and Max caught something flicker across her face—too quick to name. "Beauty can be deceptive," she said quietly.

Vershinsky laughed, a warm sound that didn't quite reach his eyes. "My dear, you grow more philosophical each day. But she's right, Mr. Monroe. Beauty often masks danger. The most poisonous creatures in nature are frequently the most colorful."

Max sipped his wine, aware of the game being played. "I suppose that depends on whether you're the predator or the prey."

"Ah." Vershinsky's smile widened. "You see? This is why I wanted to meet you. Your file suggested intelligence, but files can be misleading. Tell me, what do you make of the current situation in Silicon Valley? All these young billionaires who believe they've invented disruption, when really they're simply repeating patterns as old as civilization itself."

"Power concentrates," Max said. "The names change, but the dynamics remain."

"Precisely." Vershinsky leaned forward, animated now. "Do you know what I learned in my previous career? Before I became, as the Western press enjoys saying, an 'oligarch'?" He pronounced the word with gentle mockery. "I learned that information is the only true currency. Money, influence, access—these are merely information in different forms. Control the flow of information, and you control everything else."

Max felt Mariana's eyes on him, though she hadn't moved from her position by the terrace's edge. The sun was beginning its descent, casting long shadows across the stone.

"The tech companies understand this," Vershinsky continued. "They collect data, they shape narratives, they decide what billions of people see and believe. Remarkable power. And like all power, it can be... influenced. Directed toward productive ends."

"Your ends," Max said.

Vershinsky's expression didn't change, but something shifted in the air between them—a recognition, perhaps, that the pleasantries had served their purpose. "I have interests in seventeen technology companies across four continents. I sit on advisory boards. I facilitate connections between entrepreneurs and government officials who can smooth regulatory challenges. I invest in promising ventures. Is this unusual? No. Is it valuable? Extremely."

He stood and walked to the terrace's edge, his silhouette framed against the Mediterranean. Mariana moved aside, creating space, and Max noticed how Vershinsky's hand brushed her lower back as he passed—a casual gesture of ownership that made Max's jaw tighten.

"You've worked with Senator Morrison's office," Vershinsky said, not turning around. "A capable man, though perhaps too idealistic for his own good. And you have connections to the intelligence community, though your file is admirably vague on specifics." Now he did turn, the setting sun behind him reducing his face to shadow. "Tell me, Mr. Monroe—what is it you really want from this meeting?"

The question hung in the air like a blade. Max was acutely aware that his answer mattered, that Vershinsky was probing for weakness, testing for deception. This was a man who had survived the collapse of empires and emerged wealthier and more powerful than before. A man who could read people the way others read books.

"I want to understand the landscape," Max said carefully. "The senator is concerned about foreign influence in American technology. I'm here to learn if those concerns are justified."

"Foreign influence." Vershinsky repeated the words as if tasting them. "Such a quaint phrase. As if capital has nationality, as if innovation respects borders. The world is integrated now, Mr. Monroe. Money flows where it can grow. Talent goes where it's valued. Information moves at the speed of light. These are realities, not threats."

"Unless the integration serves purposes beyond profit."

"Everything serves multiple purposes." Vershinsky returned to his chair, his movements unhurried. "That's what makes it interesting. Take Mariana, for instance. She serves as my liaison to certain Latin American markets. She's brilliant with languages, understands cultural nuances that would take me years to grasp. But she also appreciates fine art, plays Chopin beautifully, and has opinions on Dostoevsky that I find endlessly engaging. Multiple purposes, multiple values."

Max glanced at Mariana. Her face remained composed, but her hands had tightened on the terrace railing. She was gripping it hard enough that her knuckles had gone white.

"People aren't assets," Max said quietly.

"No?" Vershinsky's eyebrows rose. "Then you've never worked in intelligence, Mr. Monroe. Everyone is an asset. The only question is whether they know it." He finished his wine and set the glass down with a soft click. "But I'm being a poor host. You came to discuss investment opportunities, and here I am philosophizing. Let me be direct: I'm interested in expanding my portfolio in the American market. Specifically, companies working on artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and biotechnology. I have capital to deploy and connections that can open doors. What I need are partners who understand the regulatory environment and can navigate it effectively."

"Partners," Max repeated.

"Or intermediaries, if you prefer. I'm flexible on terminology." Vershinsky smiled. "I've worked with several members of Congress over the years. Senator Morrison is new to me, but his committee assignments are relevant to my interests. Perhaps an introduction could be arranged? Purely social, of course. I'm hosting a gathering next month in Geneva—very exclusive, very productive. The senator might find it enlightening."

Max felt the trap being set, the delicate web of obligation and compromise that Vershinsky was spinning. This was how it worked: a meeting, an introduction, a favor that seemed harmless. Then another. And another. Until the web was too thick to escape.

"I'll mention it to him," Max said noncommittally.

"Please do." Vershinsky stood, signaling that the meeting was concluding. "I think we understand each other, Mr. Monroe. You're cautious—wise, given your position. But consider this: the future will be built by those who can bridge divides, who

**Scene 3: The conversation shifts to bus...**

**Scene 3: The conversation shifts to business**

Vershinsky's study smelled of leather, tobacco, and old money. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves lined three walls, filled with first editions in Russian, English, and French. The fourth wall was different—a bank of discreet monitors displaying feeds from cameras positioned throughout the villa's grounds. Max counted at least twenty screens, their silent vigil a reminder that nothing here escaped observation.

The oligarch settled into a high-backed chair behind a mahogany desk that probably cost more than Max's annual salary. Mariana stood near the window, backlit by the afternoon sun filtering through sheer curtains, her face half in shadow.

"Now then, Mr. Monroe." Vershinsky steepled his fingers, the gesture almost professorial. "Let us discuss opportunity. The tech sector is entering a fascinating phase—quantum computing, neural interfaces, AI governance systems. The future, as they say, is being written in code."

Max nodded, playing his role. "My clients are always interested in emerging markets."

"Of course they are." Vershinsky's smile didn't reach his eyes. "I've recently acquired a significant stake in NeuroLink Systems. You know them, perhaps? Based in Palo Alto. Their CEO, David Chen, is a visionary. We had dinner just last month in San Francisco."

The name hit Max like a punch to the sternum. David Chen was on Mariana's list—number seven, marked with a red asterisk. According to the CIA's internal files, Chen had been flagged for accepting foreign investment under suspicious circumstances. The investigation had been quietly buried.

"I'm familiar with their work," Max said carefully.

"Excellent." Vershinsky rose, moving to a sidebar where crystal decanters caught the light. He poured amber liquid into three glasses without asking. "Then you'll appreciate the synergy. NeuroLink's technology pairs beautifully with certain government contracts. Homeland Security, for instance. My good friend James Hargrove has been instrumental in facilitating those relationships."

Max's blood ran cold. James Hargrove. Deputy Director of the CIA's Directorate of Operations. His boss's boss. The man who'd personally approved Max's assignment to Barcelona.

Vershinsky handed Max a glass, then carried one to Mariana. His fingers brushed hers as she accepted it, lingering a fraction too long. She didn't flinch, but Max saw her jaw tighten almost imperceptibly.

"James and I go back many years," Vershinsky continued, settling back into his chair. "To before the Wall came down. We understood each other then, and we understand each other now. The ideologies change, but the game remains the same."

"Which game is that?" Max asked, knowing he was pushing but unable to stop himself.

"Survival. Power. Control." Vershinsky sipped his drink. "The Americans like to pretend they're different from us, but at the top, we're all the same. We all want to shape the future. The question is simply who has the vision—and the resources—to do it."

One of the monitors caught Max's eye. A gardener was trimming hedges near the south wall, his movements methodical. On another screen, two men in suits patrolled the perimeter, hands resting on concealed weapons.

"I also have interests in BioSphere Analytics," Vershinsky said. "Their work in predictive modeling is revolutionary. The CEO, Patricia Valdez, she understands that data is the new oil. And like oil, it must be refined, controlled, distributed to the right people."

Patricia Valdez. Number twelve on the list. Max had read her file—connections to a pharmaceutical company that had been accused of manipulating clinical trial data. The whistleblower had died in a car accident before testifying.

"Senator Marcus Webb sits on the committee that regulates her industry," Vershinsky added, almost as an afterthought. "Fortunately, Marcus is pragmatic about innovation. He knows when to... facilitate progress."

The pattern was becoming clear, a web of corruption so vast and intricate that Max felt dizzy trying to trace its threads. Each name Vershinsky dropped was another connection, another node in a network that spanned continents and penetrated the highest levels of government and industry.

And Mariana had been killing them, one by one.

Max glanced at her. She stood perfectly still, the glass untouched in her hand, her expression unreadable. But her eyes—those dark, dangerous eyes—were fixed on Vershinsky with an intensity that made Max's skin prickle.

"You seem troubled, Mr. Monroe," Vershinsky observed. "Perhaps this is too much too quickly?"

"Just processing," Max said. "It's an impressive network."

"Network." Vershinsky rolled the word around like a fine wine. "Yes, I suppose it is. Though I prefer to think of it as an ecosystem. Everyone has their role. Everyone benefits. Even you, if you're wise enough to see the opportunity."

He stood, moving to one of the bookshelves. His fingers traced the spine of a leather-bound volume—Machiavelli's *The Prince*, Max noted with grim irony.

"The old systems are dying," Vershinsky said. "Democracy, capitalism, communism—they're all just theater now. What matters is who controls the infrastructure. The data. The technology. The politicians who write the laws and the intelligence officers who enforce them." He turned, and his smile was that of a shark. "People like James Hargrove. People like you, perhaps."

The implication hung in the air like poison gas.

Max's phone buzzed in his pocket—once, twice. The signal he and Elena had arranged. Something was wrong.

"I should take this," he said, reaching for the phone.

"Of course." Vershinsky waved a hand magnanimously. "Business never sleeps."

Max stood, moving toward the door. Behind him, he heard Vershinsky say something to Mariana in Russian, his tone intimate and possessive. Her response was too quiet to hear, but when Max glanced back, he saw Vershinsky's hand on her shoulder, and the look in her eyes was pure, controlled hatred.

In the hallway, Max checked his phone. Elena's message was brief: *Facial recognition hit. Vershinsky's head of security is FSB. Active agent. Get out.*

Max's hand tightened on the phone. He was standing in the home of a Russian intelligence asset, surrounded by armed guards, having just learned that his own deputy director was compromised. And somewhere in this fortress, Mariana was planning to kill the man who owned it.

The question was no longer whether Max was in over his head. The question was whether he'd live long enough to surface.

**Scene 4: Throughout the meeting, Max ob...**

**Scene 4: Throughout the meeting, Max observes Vershinsky's interactions with Mariana**

The villa's architecture guided them through a carefully choreographed journey of wealth. Vershinsky led them from the terrace through a gallery lined with what Max suspected were original Impressionist paintings, their value enough to fund a small nation's budget. Mariana walked slightly behind them, her heels clicking on marble that had probably been quarried in Carrara.

"You appreciate art, Mr. Monroe?" Vershinsky gestured at a Monet, his hand settling on Mariana's lower back as she passed. The touch lingered a fraction too long, fingers spreading possessively across the silk of her dress.

Max's jaw tightened. "I appreciate beauty when I see it."

"As do I." Vershinsky's smile didn't reach his eyes. His hand slid higher on Mariana's back, guiding her forward like a prized thoroughbred. "Beauty is meant to be acquired, protected. Controlled."

They entered a library that smelled of leather and old money. Floor-to-ceiling shelves held first editions behind climate-controlled glass. Vershinsky moved to a sideboard, pouring amber liquid into crystal tumblers.

"Mariana, bring these to our guest."

Not a request. A command.

She moved with practiced grace, taking the glasses and crossing to Max. Her eyes met his for a microsecond—something flickered there, a warning or plea he couldn't decipher. Her fingers brushed his as she handed him the tumbler, and he felt the tremor she was hiding.

"Thank you," Max said, holding her gaze.

"She is efficient, yes?" Vershinsky's voice cut between them. "I have trained her well. Come, Mariana."

He snapped his fingers once, a sharp sound that made Max's blood boil. She returned to Vershinsky's side immediately, and he draped his arm across her shoulders, thumb stroking the curve of her collarbone in slow, deliberate circles.

Max forced himself to sip the whiskey—probably worth more than most people's monthly salary—and focus on the mission. But every proprietary touch, every casual display of ownership, carved deeper into his composure.

"Your portfolio mentioned interests in biotech," Vershinsky said, settling into a leather chair and pulling Mariana down to perch on the armrest beside him. His hand rested on her thigh, fingers drumming possessively against the fabric. "I have connections in that sector. Very lucrative connections."

"I'm always interested in profitable ventures." Max sat across from them, watching Vershinsky's hand slide higher on Mariana's leg. She didn't flinch, didn't react at all—the stillness of someone who had learned that resistance only made things worse.

"Of course you are. Men like us, we understand value." Vershinsky's fingers tightened on Mariana's thigh. "We take what we want, protect what we own. You understand this, yes?"

The rage building in Max's chest was a living thing, hot and coiled. He imagined breaking every finger currently touching her. Instead, he smiled. "I understand investment."

"Investment, possession—same thing." Vershinsky laughed, the sound cultured and cold. He looked up at Mariana, his expression shifting to something darker. "Bring me the Davidoff file from the safe. You know the code."

She rose immediately, moving toward a panel in the wall.

"And Mariana?" Vershinsky's voice stopped her mid-step. "Don't keep me waiting."

"Of course not, Mikhail." Her voice was perfectly modulated, empty of emotion.

As she disappeared through a side door, Vershinsky leaned forward, his demeanor shifting to something more conspiratorial. "Beautiful, intelligent, and obedient. Rare combination. She knows her place, knows her value. This is important in any... asset."

Max's knuckles whitened around the tumbler. "You seem very... invested in her."

"She is mine." Simple. Absolute. "I found her when she was nothing—brilliant but directionless. I gave her purpose, opportunity. She understands what she owes me."

The words hung in the air like poison gas. Max forced another sip of whiskey, using the burn to center himself. He was Max Monroe, venture capitalist. Not Max Monroe, former Delta operator who wanted to put this bastard through the plate glass window behind him.

Mariana returned with a leather portfolio, moving back to Vershinsky's side. He took it without looking at her, but his free hand immediately found her waist, pulling her close.

"Good girl," he murmured, the words making Max's skin crawl.

She stood rigid beside him, her face a beautiful mask, while Vershinsky opened the portfolio and began discussing shell companies and offshore accounts. But Max saw the way her breathing had gone shallow, the tension in her shoulders, the microscopic flinch when Vershinsky's hand moved to the small of her back.

As Vershinsky droned on about investment opportunities and political connections, Max made mental notes—not just about the financial crimes being casually discussed, but about every exit, every security camera, every potential extraction point.

Because one thing had become crystal clear: whatever mission parameters he'd been given, whatever agency objectives existed, he wasn't leaving Barcelona without getting Mariana away from this monster.

Vershinsky's phone buzzed. He glanced at it, frowned. "Excuse me. Moscow calls—I must take this." He stood, his hand trailing across Mariana's hip as he passed. "Entertain our guest, darling. But not too well."

He laughed at his own implication and strode toward the terrace, already speaking rapid Russian into his phone.

The moment he was out of earshot, Mariana's mask cracked. She moved closer to Max, her voice dropping to barely a whisper.

"Not everything is what it seems. Be careful who you trust."

Max leaned in, his own voice low. "Mariana—"

But Vershinsky's laugh echoed from the terrace, and she stepped back immediately, the mask sliding back into place as if it had never slipped. By the time the oligarch returned, she was standing by the window, the picture of serene composure.

Max's hands ached from clenching them. The mission had just become personal.

**Scene 5: When Vershinsky steps away to ...**

**Scene 5: When Vershinsky steps away to take an urgent encrypted call**

The library smelled of old leather and cigar smoke, a masculine sanctuary lined floor to ceiling with books Max suspected had never been opened. Vershinsky's phone had buzzed three times before the oligarch finally excused himself, his charm evaporating as he barked something in rapid Russian and strode toward the French doors leading to the terrace.

Max watched him go, relief loosening the tension in his shoulders. Two hours of verbal chess had left him exhausted, every word a potential landmine. He reached for his water glass, his hand not quite steady.

"He likes you."

Mariana's voice was barely above a whisper. She'd been silent throughout the meeting, a beautiful ornament positioned in the corner armchair, legs crossed, watching everything with those dark, unreadable eyes. Now she was moving, rising with fluid grace, closing the distance between them.

Max set down his glass. "That's not reassuring."

"It shouldn't be." She stopped inches away, close enough that he caught her perfume—something subtle and expensive that cut through the library's heavier scents. Close enough to see the fine tension in her jaw, the way her fingers curled slightly at her sides. "Max, listen to me carefully."

Through the glass doors, Vershinsky paced the terrace, his back to them, phone pressed to his ear. Max could see the rigid set of the oligarch's shoulders, the sharp gestures of a man accustomed to giving orders.

"Not everything is what it seems." Mariana's eyes locked onto his, and Max felt the weight of something urgent, almost desperate, behind her words. "Be careful who you trust."

The statement hung between them, heavy with implications. Max's pulse quickened. "Including you?"

Something flickered across her face—pain, perhaps, or regret. Her hand moved as if to touch his arm, then stopped, hovering in the space between them. "Especially me."

"Mariana—"

"He's coming back." She stepped away as smoothly as she'd approached, but not before Max saw it—the briefest flash of fear in her eyes, there and gone like a candle flame in wind. "Remember what I said. Trust no one. Not even yourself."

The cryptic warning sent ice down Max's spine. What the hell did that mean? He wanted to grab her, demand answers, but Vershinsky was already pushing through the French doors, his expression thunderous before settling back into practiced affability.

"My apologies," the oligarch said, sliding his phone into his jacket pocket. "Business never sleeps, as you Americans say." His gaze moved between them, sharp and assessing. "I hope Mariana has been keeping you entertained?"

"We were discussing the architecture," Mariana said smoothly, her voice devoid of the urgency from moments before. She'd transformed again, becoming the elegant accessory, her face a beautiful mask. "The ceiling frescoes are eighteenth century, yes?"

"Seventeenth, actually." Vershinsky moved to her side, his hand settling on the small of her back with casual possession. "Salvaged from a monastery in Valencia. Everything has its price, Max. Everything can be acquired if one knows the right pressure points to apply."

Max forced himself to meet the oligarch's eyes, to ignore the way Mariana's shoulders had gone rigid beneath Vershinsky's touch. "I'll keep that in mind."

"Please do." Vershinsky's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Now, shall we continue our discussion? I have a proposition regarding your company's encryption protocols that I think you'll find most... interesting."

As they returned to their seats, Max caught Mariana's reflection in one of the library's gilt-framed mirrors. She was watching him, her expression unguarded for just a heartbeat. The look in her eyes was a warning and a plea combined.

Trust no one. Not even yourself.

The words echoed in Max's mind as Vershinsky began speaking again, weaving his web of influence and opportunity. Outside, the Mediterranean sun was setting, painting the sky in shades of blood and gold.

**Scene 6: Vershinsky returns and the mee...**

**Scene 6: Vershinsky returns and the meeting concludes**

The terrace doors swept open with theatrical precision, and Vershinsky materialized like a conductor returning to his orchestra. His phone had already disappeared into the folds of his linen jacket, his expression revealing nothing of the conversation that had pulled him away.

"My apologies," he said, settling back into his chair with the fluid grace of a man who'd spent decades controlling rooms. "Moscow never sleeps, even when the sun shines on Barcelona."

Max forced his posture to relax, Mariana's whispered warning still burning in his ear. *Not everything is what it seems. Be careful who you trust.* The words had been so quick, so urgent, that he'd barely had time to register the fear beneath them before she'd leaned back, her face resuming its professional mask.

"Business waits for no one," Max said, reaching for his water glass to buy himself a moment. The condensation was cold against his palm, grounding him.

Vershinsky's smile widened, revealing teeth too perfect to be entirely natural. "Indeed. Which brings me to a proposal." He leaned forward, elbows on the wrought-iron table, fingers steepled. "There is a summit in three weeks. Dubai. The Global Technology and Innovation Forum—you may have heard of it?"

Max had. It was invitation-only, a gathering of tech titans, venture capitalists, and the kind of power brokers who shaped policy from the shadows. The kind of event that didn't make headlines but changed the world nonetheless.

"I'm familiar with it," Max said carefully.

"I thought you might be." Vershinsky's eyes gleamed with something that might have been amusement or calculation—with him, it was impossible to tell the difference. "I have secured several invitations for promising entrepreneurs in my portfolio. Consider this one yours. The opportunities for mutual benefit are... substantial."

The phrase hung in the air like bait on a hook. *Mutual benefit.* In Vershinsky's vocabulary, that could mean anything from a lucrative investment to a binding obligation that would take years to escape.

"That's generous," Max said, keeping his tone neutral. "What would you expect in return?"

Vershinsky laughed, a rich sound that echoed off the villa's stone walls. "Always the American directness. I appreciate that." He stood, buttoning his jacket with practiced ease. "For now? Nothing. Come to Dubai. Listen. Learn. See what possibilities exist when capital and vision align. We can discuss specifics when you've had time to consider the landscape."

Max rose as well, aware that the meeting had reached its conclusion. Vershinsky extended his hand, and Max shook it, feeling the surprising strength in the older man's grip.

"Mariana will send you the details," Vershinsky said, guiding Max toward the villa's entrance with a hand that barely touched his elbow but somehow directed him completely. "Travel arrangements, accommodations, schedule. Everything will be taken care of."

They walked through the villa's cool interior, past artwork that belonged in museums and security cameras disguised as architectural details. Max's mind raced, trying to process everything he'd learned, everything he'd observed. The names Vershinsky had dropped so casually—tech CEOs, senators, intelligence officials—formed a constellation of corruption that stretched across three continents.

At the massive front door, Vershinsky paused. "One more thing, Mr. Monroe. Dubai is a city of mirrors. Everyone you meet will show you a reflection of what they want you to see. The key to success is knowing which reflections are real." His smile never wavered. "Safe travels."

The door closed with a solid thunk, and Max found himself on the circular driveway, the Mediterranean sun suddenly too bright after the villa's filtered light. His rental car waited where he'd left it, looking small and vulnerable against the backdrop of Vershinsky's fortress.

Max's hand was on the door handle when movement caught his eye. He looked up, scanning the villa's facade, and found her—Mariana, standing at a second-floor window. She was partially obscured by gauze curtains that billowed in the breeze, but he could see her face clearly enough. She wasn't looking at him with the professional courtesy she'd maintained throughout the meeting. Instead, her expression was raw, urgent, almost pleading.

Their eyes locked for three seconds. Four. Then she raised one hand, pressing it flat against the glass. The gesture could have meant anything—goodbye, warning, plea for help. Before Max could react, she stepped back, and the curtains fell closed, erasing her from view.

Max slid into the driver's seat, his pulse hammering in his throat. He started the engine, feeling the weight of surveillance cameras tracking his departure. As he navigated down the long driveway, past manicured gardens and discrete security posts, his phone buzzed.

A calendar invitation. The Dubai summit. Three weeks from today.

He accepted it with one hand, steering with the other as the villa's gates swung open to release him. The Mediterranean stretched out to his left, impossibly blue, impossibly beautiful. To his right, Barcelona sprawled toward the horizon, a city of secrets and shadows.

Max thought about Mariana's whispered warning. About Vershinsky's casual display of connections that should have been impossible. About the summit in Dubai, where mirrors would show only what people wanted him to see.

He was in it now—fully entangled in a web where every strand connected to something darker, where every player wore masks within masks. Sarah would be furious when he debriefed. Chen would want to pull him out. But Max knew with cold certainty that the only way through was forward.

Dubai was the nexus. Whatever Vershinsky was building, whatever network of corruption and influence he represented, it would all converge there.

Max pressed harder on the accelerator, putting distance between himself and the villa, though he knew distance meant nothing anymore. He was already caught.

The question now was whether he could turn the web against its creator before it consumed him completely.
