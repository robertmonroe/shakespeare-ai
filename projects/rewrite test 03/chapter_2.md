## Chapter 2: Viral Dreams

**Scene 1: Javier wakes up to discover hi...**

**Scene 1: Javier wakes up to discover his latest mariachi fusion video has exploded overnight**

The buzzing wouldn't stop.

Javier's phone vibrated against the wooden nightstand in a relentless rhythm, dancing closer to the edge with each notification. He groaned and reached for it blindly, his eyes still crusted with sleep, squinting against the morning light filtering through his bedroom curtains.

The screen was alive with numbers.

His heart stuttered. He blinked hard, certain he was misreading. The video he'd posted before bed—a ranchera melody woven through with electronic beats, his voice soaring over both his vihuela and a synthesized bass line—had 2.3 million views.

2.3 *million*.

Javier sat bolt upright, his Dodgers comforter falling to his waist. His fingers trembled as he unlocked the phone, and immediately the notifications exploded across the screen like fireworks. Comments. Shares. Follows. The numbers climbed even as he watched, ticking upward in real-time.

"No way," he whispered. "No way, no way, no way."

He tapped into the comments section, his pulse hammering in his ears.

*This is INCREDIBLE. Why isn't this on the radio???*

*Finally someone who gets it—honoring roots while pushing forward. More of THIS please!*

*Crying at my desk. My abuela would have loved this. Thank you for keeping our music alive.*

*Who IS this guy?? Someone sign him already!*

The comments scrolled endlessly, a river of words in English, Spanish, and languages he couldn't identify. Hearts and fire emojis cascaded down the screen. His follower count had jumped from eight hundred to forty-seven thousand overnight.

Javier's breath came in short gasps. His bedroom—cramped and familiar, with its peeling Selena poster and the guitar cases leaning against the closet door—suddenly felt too small, like the walls couldn't contain what was happening.

"Javi?" His mother's voice called from down the hall. "You awake? Breakfast is ready!"

He couldn't answer. His throat had closed up. He kept scrolling, reading comment after comment, each one a validation he hadn't known he'd been desperate for.

*This fusion is everything. Cultural pride meets innovation.*

*I've listened to this 20 times already. When's the album dropping?*

*From Tokyo with love—your music transcends borders, hermano.*

His hands shook so badly he nearly dropped the phone. Someone in Tokyo was listening to his music. Someone in Tokyo *cared* about what he'd created in this tiny bedroom in East LA, where the traffic noise from Whittier Boulevard was already building outside his window.

"Javier Hernández, if you're on that phone instead of getting ready—"

"Mamá!" The word burst out of him. He stumbled out of bed, his feet tangling in the sheets, nearly face-planting on the worn carpet. He caught himself on the doorframe and threw open his bedroom door.

His mother stood in the hallway, wooden spoon in hand, her eyebrows raised in that expression that usually meant he was in trouble. But he was grinning so wide his face hurt.

"Mamá, look!" He thrust the phone toward her, the screen still glowing with notifications. "Look at this!"

She took the phone carefully, her expression shifting from annoyed to confused to astonished as she scrolled. Her lips moved silently, counting the views.

"Mijo," she breathed. "This is... is this real?"

"I don't know!" Javier laughed, a slightly manic sound. "I posted it last night before bed and now—" He gestured wildly at the phone, at the universe, at everything. "Now people everywhere are watching it. People in other *countries*, Mamá."

She looked up at him, and he saw his own disbelief mirrored in her dark eyes. Then, slowly, a smile broke across her face—the genuine one she saved for when he'd done something that made her truly proud.

"Ay, Dios mío," she whispered, pulling him into a tight hug. The wooden spoon pressed awkwardly against his back. "My talented boy."

But even as Javier hugged her back, even as joy flooded through him like sunlight, a small seed of terror took root in his chest. This was real. This was happening. And he had absolutely no idea what came next.

His phone buzzed again in his mother's hand. Another notification. Then another. The world was watching now, and there was no going back.

**Scene 2: At school, Javier experiences ...**

**Scene 2: At school, Javier experiences newfound attention from classmates who previously ignored him, including some who make him uncomfortable by reducing his music to a "cool Mexican thing." His best friend congratulates him, but Javier notices the complex mix of admiration and envy in their interaction.**

The hallway smelled like floor wax and the cafeteria's mystery meat from lunch, but Javier barely noticed as he navigated through the Tuesday morning crowd. His phone had been buzzing since he woke up—notifications stacking on top of notifications, his video's view count climbing into numbers that didn't seem real.

"Yo, Javier!"

He turned to find Brandon Chen—*Brandon Chen*, who'd never spoken more than three words to him in two years—jogging to catch up.

"Dude, that video is sick! My sister showed me last night. You're like, famous now." Brandon's grin was wide and genuine, but his eyes kept darting to the students passing by, as if making sure people saw them talking.

"Oh, thanks. It's just—"

"The mariachi stuff is so cool, man. Like, so authentic." Brandon said "authentic" the way someone might say "exotic," drawing out the syllables. "My mom loves that Mexican music. She's always playing it when she cleans."

Javier's smile felt tight on his face. "That's... great."

"You should totally play at the spring talent show. Everyone would go crazy." Brandon was already backing away, mission accomplished. "Catch you later, man!"

Three more people stopped him before he reached his locker. Stephanie Rodriguez, who usually pretended not to speak Spanish even though everyone knew she did, suddenly wanted to know if he took requests. "My abuela would die if you played 'Cielito Lindo,'" she said, her voice dripping with a performative enthusiasm that made his stomach twist.

At his locker, Javier fumbled with the combination, hyper-aware of the whispers rippling through the corridor. He caught fragments—"that's him," "saw it on TikTok," "two million views now"—and felt his shoulders creep toward his ears.

"Look who's Mr. Popular."

Javier relaxed at Marco's familiar voice. His best friend since fourth grade leaned against the neighboring locker, arms crossed, wearing his usual thrifted band t-shirt—today's selection was The Smiths.

"It's insane, right?" Javier opened his locker, shoving his backpack inside. "I don't even know most of these people."

"Well, they know you now." Marco's tone was light, but something flickered across his face. "The video's everywhere. Even my mom sent it to me. My *mom*, who still thinks the internet is dangerous."

"What'd you think?" Javier tried to keep his voice casual, but he realized he actually cared about Marco's answer more than all the strangers commenting online.

Marco shrugged, studying the scuffed linoleum. "It's good. Really good. The arrangement is tight, and the way you blended the guitarrón with that beat..." He paused, jaw working. "Yeah. It's fire."

"But?"

"No but. I'm happy for you, man. Seriously." Marco's smile didn't quite reach his eyes. "Just don't forget us little people when you're playing Coachella or whatever."

He said it like a joke, but Javier heard the edge underneath. They'd spent countless hours in Marco's garage, working on songs together, dreaming about making it big as a duo. Javier had recorded this one alone, on a whim, after a lesson with Tío Miguel.

"Come on, you know it's not like that—"

"Javier Morales!"

They both turned as Ashley Kim and her two constant companions materialized, a wall of perfume and confidence that made Javier take an involuntary step back into his locker.

"Oh my God, we've been looking everywhere for you." Ashley's ponytail swished as she tilted her head, studying him like he was a painting in a museum. "That video is literally the coolest thing. I had no idea you were so talented."

Javier had sat three seats behind Ashley in English for an entire semester. She'd never once turned around.

"Thanks, I—"

"You should come to my party this weekend. It's going to be huge." Ashley's eyes sparkled with calculation. "Maybe you could bring your guitar? Play something?"

"His vihuela," Marco muttered.

Ashley's gaze flicked to Marco, then dismissed him just as quickly. "Whatever it's called. It would be amazing. Very... cultural."

The word landed like a stone in Javier's chest. Cultural. Like he was a museum exhibit. Like his music was a costume she wanted to try on.

"I'll think about it," he managed.

"Great! I'll DM you the details." Ashley and her friends swept away, already whispering to each other.

The warning bell rang, sending students scrambling. Marco pushed off from the locker.

"You going to go?" he asked.

"To Ashley Kim's party? I don't know. Probably not."

"Probably not," Marco echoed. "But maybe." He adjusted his backpack straps. "Look, I gotta get to class. Just... be careful, okay? These people, they're into you because you're trending. Next week it'll be someone else."

"I know that."

"Do you?" Marco's dark eyes were serious now, worried. "Because I've known you since we were kids, and you've always wanted this. To be noticed. To matter. Just make sure you know why they're noticing you."

Before Javier could respond, Marco disappeared into the flow of students heading to first period.

Javier stood alone by his locker, the hallway emptying around him. His phone buzzed again—another hundred notifications, another thousand views, another wave of strangers telling him how much they loved his "Mexican vibe" or asking if he knew any "Selena songs."

He thought about the music he'd made, the careful way he'd woven together the melodies Tío Miguel had taught him with the modern sounds he loved. He'd done it because it felt right, because it was honest.

But now everyone wanted to tell him what it meant. What *he* meant.

The late bell rang, shrill and insistent. Javier grabbed his books and headed to class, where his history teacher would inevitably ask him to play something, and his classmates would applaud, and he'd smile and nod and wonder why this thing he'd wanted so badly felt like wearing shoes that didn't quite fit.

His phone buzzed one more time. He glanced at the screen.

An email. The subject line made his breath catch: "Recording Opportunity – Spotlight Records."

Javier stopped in the middle of the empty hallway, staring at the words until they blurred.

Everything was about to change. He could feel it.

He just wasn't sure if he was ready.

**Scene 3: Javier receives an email from ...**

**Scene 3: Javier receives an email from Spotlight Records**

Javier's thumb had developed a mind of its own, compulsively refreshing his email every few minutes as he pretended to work on his calculus homework. The numbers on the page blurred together, meaningless symbols while his real attention stayed locked on his phone screen.

When the notification finally appeared, his heart stuttered.

**New message from: talent.scout@spotlightrecords.com**

He blinked. Read it again. The words didn't change.

His hands trembled as he opened the email, nearly dropping his phone in the process. The message was brief, professional, impossibly real:

*Dear Javier,*

*We've been following your recent viral success with great interest. Your voice and stage presence have caught the attention of our A&R team at Spotlight Records. We'd love to schedule a video call this week to discuss potential opportunities for collaboration.*

*Would you be available Thursday at 7 PM PST?*

*Best regards,*  
*Marcus Chen*  
*Talent Acquisition, Spotlight Records*

Javier read it three times. Then four. Each word seemed to glow on the screen, pulsing with possibility.

Spotlight Records. *Spotlight Records.*

He launched himself off his bed, pacing the small bedroom that suddenly felt too cramped to contain the electricity surging through his veins. His guitar leaned against the wall where he'd left it that morning, the strings still holding the ghost of last night's practice session. The fairy lights strung above his bed cast warm pools of gold across the posters on his walls—legends like Vicente Fernández and Los Tigres del Norte sharing space with Bad Bunny and Peso Pluma.

His laptop sat on his desk, buried under a pile of textbooks and sheet music. Javier shoved everything aside, papers fluttering to the floor as he flipped it open and typed "Spotlight Records" into the search bar.

The label's website loaded, sleek and professional, featuring a rotating carousel of their artists. He recognized most of them—pop singers with millions of followers, indie rock bands that had blown up on alternative radio, a few hip-hop artists whose songs dominated every party playlist. Their production values were insane: music videos shot in exotic locations, stadium performances with pyrotechnics, magazine covers and talk show appearances.

This was the real deal. This was *everything*.

Javier clicked through to their roster page, studying each artist's journey. Most had started exactly where he was now—bedroom recordings, social media followings, viral moments that caught the right person's attention. And Spotlight had transformed them into household names.

His cursor hovered over a video titled "From Viral to Victory: How Spotlight Builds Stars." He pressed play.

A montage unfolded: unknown artists in modest apartments, then cut to those same faces on award show stages, holding trophies and grinning at screaming crowds. The narrator's voice was smooth, confident: "At Spotlight Records, we don't just sign talent. We create careers."

Javier's reflection stared back at him from the darkened laptop screen during a transition, his eyes wide and hungry. He could see it so clearly—himself on those stages, his music pouring out of car speakers and headphones across the world, his family in the front row watching him live the dream.

No more wondering if music could be more than a hobby. No more apologetic explanations about "keeping his options open" when relatives asked about his future. This could be his life. His actual, real life.

A knock on his door made him jump.

"Mijo?" His father's voice filtered through the wood. "You okay in there? Thought I heard you moving furniture."

Javier scrambled to minimize the browser window, his heart still racing. "Yeah, Papá. Just... studying. Getting restless."

The door cracked open, and his father's weathered face appeared, concern creasing his forehead. He still wore his work uniform, the name patch reading "Hector" stitched above the pocket. "It's almost ten. You need sleep for school tomorrow."

"I know, I know. Just finishing up." Javier forced himself to sound casual, though every cell in his body wanted to scream the news. But something held him back—a superstitious fear that speaking it aloud might make it evaporate like morning mist.

His father's gaze swept the room, landing on the guitar. His expression softened. "You've been playing a lot lately. More than usual."

"Yeah. It helps me think."

"That's good, mijo. Just don't let it distract from your schoolwork." His father's tone carried no judgment, only the gentle worry that had become familiar over the years. "Music is beautiful, but you need something solid to fall back on."

Javier nodded, the words landing differently now. Something solid. What if music *could* be solid? What if this email was the foundation of something real?

"Good night, Papá."

"Buenas noches."

The door clicked shut, and Javier was alone again with his glowing screen and racing thoughts.

He pulled up the email once more, fingers hovering over the reply button. Thursday at seven. Two days away. He could barely imagine waiting two hours, let alone forty-eight.

*Dear Mr. Chen,*

*Thursday at 7 PM works perfectly. Thank you for this opportunity.*

*Javier Morales*

He hit send before he could second-guess the wording, then immediately wondered if he should have sounded more professional, more grateful, more something.

The sent message sat in his outbox, irreversible and terrifying and wonderful.

Javier collapsed back onto his bed, staring at the ceiling where glow-in-the-dark stars formed constellations he'd stuck up in middle school. His phone buzzed with notifications—more comments on his videos, more followers, more strangers from distant cities telling him his music moved them.

But all of it felt like prologue now. Thursday at seven, everything could change.

He grabbed his guitar, fingers finding the strings in the semi-darkness, and began to play softly. The melody that emerged was new, unformed, full of hope and hunger and the electric anticipation of dreams that might finally, impossibly, be coming true.

**Scene 4: During the video call with Spo...**

**Scene 4: During the video call with Spotlight Records executives, Javier's excitement turns to confusion**

Javier adjusted his laptop for the third time, angling it so the afternoon light from the living room window didn't wash out his face. His hands trembled slightly as he smoothed down his shirt—the nice button-up Mamá had ironed for him that morning, the one he usually saved for quinceañeras and church.

"You look handsome, mijo," Mamá whispered from the kitchen doorway, though she'd positioned herself close enough to hear everything. She'd been hovering there since he'd set up, pretending to wipe down counters that were already spotless.

The video call notification chimed. Javier's heart hammered against his ribs as he clicked accept.

Two faces materialized on screen. The woman wore a sleek black blazer, her blonde hair pulled back so tight it looked painful. The man beside her had the kind of casual-expensive look Javier had only seen in commercials—perfectly rumpled shirt, designer stubble, teeth too white to be natural.

"Javier! There he is!" The man's voice boomed through the speakers. "I'm Derek Chen, A&R Director at Spotlight Records, and this is Monica Whitfield, our VP of Artist Development."

"Hi—hello. Thank you for—" Javier's voice cracked. He cleared his throat. "Thank you for taking the time."

"Are you kidding? We should be thanking you!" Derek leaned toward his camera. "That video of yours—what was it, the one with the trumpet and the electronic beat?"

"'Corazón Moderno,'" Javier supplied.

"Right, right. Seventeen million views and counting. Seventeen million! Do you understand how rare that is? How special?" Derek's enthusiasm felt like a physical force even through the screen. "You've got something, kid. Real star quality."

Warmth flooded Javier's chest. He'd watched that number climb every hour, refreshing obsessively, but hearing it from an actual record executive made it real in a way it hadn't been before.

Monica spoke for the first time, her voice cooler, more measured. "Your energy is infectious, Javier. And your look—very authentic, very relatable. The market research shows you're particularly popular with the eighteen-to-twenty-four demographic, which is exactly where we want to be."

"We see real potential here," Derek continued. "Album potential. Tour potential. We're talking about building a brand."

Javier's mouth went dry. "That's—that's incredible. Music is everything to me. My tío, he's been teaching me mariachi since I was—"

"About that." Monica's smile didn't quite reach her eyes. "We've been analyzing your content, looking at which videos perform best, where you're getting the most engagement. And there's a pattern."

She disappeared from frame briefly, then returned holding a tablet. "Your straight pop covers? Massive engagement. The ones where you're just you, your voice, maybe some guitar? People love those. But the videos where you lean heavy into the mariachi elements—the full charro outfit, the traditional arrangements—those numbers drop by nearly forty percent."

The warmth in Javier's chest began to cool. "But 'Corazón Moderno' has the mariachi trumpet. That's what makes it different."

"Right, and we love that you're pulling from your heritage," Derek said quickly. "That little flavor, that hint of something exotic—it's great. It's a hook. But Monica's right that we need to think strategically about your image going forward."

Exotic. The word landed wrong, like a note played sharp.

"What we're proposing," Monica continued, her fingers steepled in front of her, "is a refinement. Keep that Latin energy, absolutely. Maybe one or two songs on the album with some cultural elements, but subtle. Mainstream. We want you accessible to the broadest possible audience—someone a kid in Ohio can relate to just as much as someone in Texas or California."

Behind him, Javier heard Mamá's dishrag stop moving.

"You're saying..." Javier struggled to find the right words. "You want me to stop playing mariachi music?"

"We're saying we want you to be a pop star," Derek said, his smile never wavering. "Look, the mariachi thing—it's niche. It's beautiful, don't get me wrong, but it's limiting. You've got the voice to be huge, Javier. Stadium huge. But you can't do that if you're boxing yourself into one genre, especially one that's so... specific."

"We'd set you up with our top producers," Monica added. "The people who've worked with everyone from Justin Bieber to Shawn Mendes. They'd help you find your sound—something fresh, something now. Think of it as evolution."

Javier's laptop screen blurred slightly. He blinked hard. "The mariachi isn't a box. It's who I am. It's my family, my—"

"And that's wonderful background," Derek interrupted gently. "That's your story, and we'd definitely include that in your press materials. 'From humble mariachi roots to pop sensation'—people eat that stuff up. But the actual music needs to be something that can play on Top 40 radio. You understand, right?"

The living room suddenly felt too small, too warm. Javier could smell the caldo Mamá had been simmering earlier, could hear the tick of the wall clock that had hung in the same spot his entire life. Everything familiar, everything home.

"What if I don't want to change it?" The question came out smaller than he'd intended.

Monica and Derek exchanged a glance. When Monica spoke again, her voice had acquired an edge. "Then you'd be passing up the opportunity of a lifetime. We're prepared to offer you a three-album deal, Javier. Advance payment, marketing budget, the works. But we need to know you're serious about this career. That you're willing to make the necessary adjustments to succeed at this level."

"Think about it," Derek said. "We'll send over the contract details. But Javier? Kid? This doesn't come around twice. You're viral now, but that's a flash. Tomorrow, next week, it could be someone else. You need to strike while people still remember your name."

The call ended with promises to send paperwork, with Derek's too-bright smile and Monica's cool nod. When their faces disappeared, Javier found himself staring at his own reflection in the black screen—a teenage boy in an ironed shirt, sitting in a living room that suddenly felt like it belonged to someone else's life.

"Mijo." Mamá's hand landed on his shoulder. Her fingers were cold from handling ice water. "What did they say?"

Javier opened his mouth, but the words tangled in his throat. How could he explain that his dream was being offered to him, but only if he agreed to cut out its heart?

The email notification pinged. Contract attached. Subject line: "Your Future Starts Here."

His hand hovered over the trackpad, unable to click, unable to close the laptop, unable to do anything but sit frozen between two versions of himself—the one who could have everything he'd imagined, and the one who'd still be able to look Tío Miguel in the eye.

**Scene 5: Javier visits Tío Miguel for h...**

**Scene 5: Javier visits Tío Miguel for his regular lesson**

Javier climbed the narrow stairs to his uncle's apartment two at a time, his phone clutched in his hand like a talisman. The screen still glowed with notifications—another thousand followers since breakfast, comments in languages he couldn't read, hearts and fire emojis cascading beneath his latest video. His chest felt tight with excitement, with the need to share this moment with the one person who would truly understand what it meant.

The hallway smelled of Mrs. Cordova's pozole from apartment 3B and the faint mustiness of old carpet. Javier knocked on the familiar door with its peeling number seven, already imagining Tío Miguel's face when he told him about the record label's interest. Maybe his uncle would finally see that the lessons had been worth it, that Javier wasn't just another kid playing around.

The door opened.

Tío Miguel stood in the threshold, but something was wrong. The warmth that usually lit his uncle's weathered face—the crinkle around his eyes, the slight upward curve of his mouth—was absent. Instead, his expression was flat, carved from stone.

"Tío, you won't believe what—"

"Come in." The words were clipped, cold.

Javier's excitement faltered as he stepped inside. The small apartment felt different today. The afternoon light streaming through the window seemed harsh rather than golden, illuminating dust motes that hung in the air like tiny accusations. The music stand stood empty in the corner. Tío Miguel's vihuela rested in its case, latched shut.

His uncle moved to the kitchen table, where his laptop sat open. Javier's stomach dropped. On the screen, frozen mid-strum, was his own face—the thumbnail from his most recent video.

"Tío, I was going to tell you—"

"When?" Miguel's voice was quiet, which somehow made it worse than if he'd shouted. "When were you going to tell me that you've been performing our music for strangers? That you've been taking what I taught you in this room and—" He gestured at the screen, his hand trembling slightly. "—and putting it out there like some kind of show?"

"It's not like that." Javier's words tumbled out. "I'm sharing it. People love it. They're commenting from Mexico City, from Guadalajara, from places I've never even heard of, saying how beautiful it is, how it makes them think of home—"

"Home." Miguel's laugh was bitter. He closed the laptop with a decisive snap. "You think you're showing them home? You think a thirty-second video with your face in it, with your pop music backing track, shows them anything real?"

The words stung like a slap. "I thought you'd be proud. I'm getting millions of views. There's a record label that wants to sign me. A real label, Tío. This could be everything."

"Everything." Miguel repeated the word like it tasted sour. He turned away, staring out the window at the street below. His shoulders were rigid beneath his faded guayabera. "Do you know why I teach you? Why I spend my Saturdays showing you techniques that took me years to learn?"

Javier opened his mouth, then closed it. He'd never really thought about it.

"I teach you because this music is not entertainment. It's not content." Miguel's voice cracked on the last word, as if the term itself wounded him. "Every song I've taught you carries the voices of men who played it before us. My father. His father. Men who played at weddings and funerals, who played when there was nothing else to give. And you—" He turned back, and Javier saw something in his uncle's eyes that looked like grief. "You take it and you perform it for strangers who click a button and move on to the next video of a cat or a dance or whatever else appears on their screen."

"That's not fair." Javier's own anger flared now, hot and defensive. "You're the one who always said music should be shared. You said it's meant to connect people."

"Connect, yes. Not broadcast. Not package and sell." Miguel moved to the music stand, gripping it with both hands. "You don't understand what you're doing. You think because they leave comments, because they press a heart, that means something? They consume you, Javier. They consume our heritage like it's fast food, and tomorrow they won't even remember your name."

"You're wrong." But Javier's voice wavered. "This is my chance. This is how music works now. If I don't put myself out there, nobody will ever hear me."

"Maybe that's how your music works." Miguel's words fell like stones. "But this—what I've been teaching you—this is not yours to give away so cheaply."

The silence that followed was suffocating. Javier could hear the tick of the wall clock, the distant wail of a siren on the street below, his own heartbeat pounding in his ears.

"So what are you saying?" Javier's throat felt tight. "You won't teach me anymore?"

Miguel looked at him for a long moment, and the pain in his uncle's face was so raw that Javier had to look away. "I'm saying I don't know who I've been teaching. The Javier I thought I knew would have understood what this music means. Would have respected it enough to ask before turning it into—" He waved his hand dismissively. "—into whatever this is."

"Tío—"

"I think you should go."

The words hung in the air between them, final and irrevocable. Javier stood frozen, waiting for his uncle to take them back, to soften, to be the Tío Miguel who had always believed in him. But Miguel had already turned away, moving to the window again, his back a wall of disappointment.

Javier's hands clenched around his phone. All those notifications, all those comments and views and opportunities—they suddenly felt hollow, meaningless in the face of his uncle's rejection. But beneath the hurt, anger simmered. How could Tío Miguel not see that this was his dream coming true? How could he turn something beautiful into something shameful?

"Fine." The word came out harder than Javier intended. "I'll go. But you're wrong about this. You're wrong about all of it."

He didn't wait for a response. He walked to the door, each step feeling like a betrayal of something he couldn't quite name. His hand was on the doorknob when his uncle spoke again.

"That record label." Miguel's voice was barely above a whisper. "They will ask you to choose, mijo. And I'm afraid I already know what you'll choose."

Javier wanted to argue, to defend himself, to demand an explanation for what his uncle meant. But the weight of disappointment in the room was crushing, and he couldn't breathe. He yanked open the door and left, letting it close behind him with a soft click that sounded like an ending.

In the hallway, he stood for a moment, staring at his phone screen. A new notification appeared—someone had shared his video with a caption in Portuguese. The number beneath it climbed: 2.3 million views. 2.4 million. 2.5 million.

The numbers blurred as unexpected tears stung his eyes. This was supposed to be the best moment of his life. So why did it feel like he'd just lost something irreplaceable?

**Scene 6: At a family gathering that wee...**

**Scene 6: At a family gathering that weekend, Tío Miguel refuses to acknowledge Javier**

The smell of carne asada drifted through Abuela's backyard, mixing with the sweet scent of her jasmine vines climbing the weathered fence. Javier stood near the sliding glass door, watching his family through the reflection—cousins chasing each other around the picnic tables, his aunts arranging platters of food on the long folding table covered in plastic tablecloths decorated with chili peppers.

He'd been at the gathering for forty minutes and hadn't said more than ten words.

"Mijo, ven a comer," his mother called from the patio, waving him over with a paper plate already loaded with rice and beans.

Javier shook his head. "Not hungry yet, Mamá."

She exchanged a glance with his father, who was manning the grill. Even from here, Javier could see the concern creasing her forehead. They'd noticed something was wrong—parents always did—but they didn't know what.

Through the kitchen window, Javier spotted Tío Miguel accepting a beer from Tía Rosa. His uncle's face was animated, laughing at something she'd said, his whole body relaxed in a way it never was anymore around Javier.

Javier's phone felt like a brick in his pocket. The unsigned contract sat in his email, waiting. The deadline was Monday—two days away.

He moved through the kitchen, weaving between his younger cousins who were sneaking cookies before dinner. Tío Miguel stood by the refrigerator, peeling the label off his beer bottle with his thumb.

"Tío," Javier said softly.

His uncle's shoulders stiffened. Without looking up, Miguel took a long drink and walked past him, so close Javier could smell the familiar scent of his cologne—the same one he'd worn for years, the one that had always meant safety and guidance.

Now it just smelled like rejection.

"Miguel!" Tía Rosa called from the living room. "Come look at the pictures from Andrea's quinceañera!"

Tío Miguel disappeared around the corner without a backward glance.

Javier stood frozen in the kitchen, his chest tight. A week ago—just one week—they'd been in the garage together, his uncle's hands guiding his fingers across the guitarrón strings, patient and proud. Now Miguel wouldn't even meet his eyes.

"Everything okay, primo?" His cousin Danny appeared at his elbow, holding two Jarritos.

"Yeah. Fine." Javier accepted the pineapple soda automatically, though he didn't want it.

"You sure? You look like someone kicked your dog."

"I don't have a dog."

Danny laughed, but it faded when Javier didn't join in. "Seriously, though. You and Tío Miguel have a fight or something? He practically ran away from you just now."

"Something like that."

"Want to talk about it?"

Javier shook his head. How could he explain? That his uncle had discovered the videos, seen the record deal offer, and now refused to speak to him? That he didn't even know why Miguel was so angry, because his uncle wouldn't stay in the same room long enough to tell him?

Danny squeezed his shoulder and drifted back toward the other cousins playing lotería at the dining room table.

Javier tried twice more over the next hour. Once, he cornered Tío Miguel near the bathroom, but his uncle simply said, "Excuse me, mijo," in a voice so formal and distant it might as well have belonged to a stranger, and slipped past him. The second time, Javier found him alone on the front porch, but Miguel saw him coming through the screen door and immediately went back inside, calling for Abuela to ask if she needed help with anything.

Each rejection landed like a physical blow.

By the time the sun started setting, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple, Javier gave up. He grabbed his hoodie from the pile of jackets on Abuela's bed and slipped out to the backyard, to the far corner where an old wooden bench sat beneath the avocado tree.

This was where he and Tío Miguel used to sit during family parties when Javier was younger, when the noise and chaos got to be too much. His uncle would tell him stories about the old mariachi groups, about performers who could make grown men cry with a single note, about the history woven into every song.

Now Javier sat alone, the bench feeling too big without Miguel beside him.

He pulled out his phone, the screen's glow harsh in the gathering dusk. The email from Spotlight Records stared back at him. He'd read it so many times he'd memorized it:

*We're excited to offer you a recording contract... incredible potential... mainstream appeal... streamlined sound... broader audience...*

All the words that meant: leave behind what makes you different.

Behind him, through the kitchen window, he heard his family laughing. Someone had put on music—not mariachi, just Top 40 radio hits. His mother's voice rose above the others, telling a story that made everyone crack up.

He should be in there with them. Instead, he was out here, thumb hovering over the contract, completely alone.

A door slid open. For one desperate moment, Javier's heart leaped—maybe Tío Miguel had finally come to talk to him.

But it was his father, carrying two plates of food.

"Your mother insisted," Papá said, settling onto the bench and handing Javier a plate. "Said you'd waste away to nothing if someone didn't make you eat."

Javier accepted the plate but didn't pick up the plastic fork.

His father ate in silence for a moment, then said carefully, "You want to tell me what's going on with you and your tío?"

"He won't talk to me."

"I noticed. Why not?"

Javier's throat tightened. "I don't know. He just... he found out about something, and now he won't even look at me."

"Found out about what?"

The contract felt like it was burning through his phone, through his pocket, straight into his skin. But Javier couldn't say it out loud. Not yet. Not when he didn't understand why it mattered so much, why Tío Miguel's silence hurt worse than any criticism could have.

"I can't explain it," Javier whispered.

His father sighed, the sound heavy with concern. "Mijo, whatever it is, Miguel loves you. You know that, right? He's stubborn—always has been—but he loves you."

Javier nodded, not trusting his voice.

"Give him time. He'll come around."

But time was exactly what Javier didn't have. The deadline was Monday morning. In less than forty-eight hours, he had to decide: sign the contract and lose the mariachi elements that had brought him and his uncle together, or turn down the offer and maybe lose his only shot at the dream he'd been chasing his whole life.

His father finished his food and stood, resting a hand briefly on Javier's shoulder. "Come inside when you're ready. Your abuela wants to cut the cake soon."

Then Javier was alone again, the party continuing without him, the contract waiting, and Tío Miguel somewhere inside, so close and yet completely unreachable.

He looked down at his phone one more time. The email sat there, patient and persistent, demanding an answer he didn't know how to give.

Without his uncle's guidance, without understanding why this mattered so much, how was he supposed to choose?

The avocado tree rustled above him in the evening breeze. From inside, someone turned up the music. His family's laughter drifted out through the open windows, warm and familiar and impossibly far away.

Javier sat in the darkness, clutching his phone, and had never felt more alone.
