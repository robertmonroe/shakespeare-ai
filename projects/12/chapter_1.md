## Chapter 1: Crimson Dawn

**Scene 1: Dr. Kira Chen performs routine...**

**Scene 1: Dr. Kira Chen performs routine maintenance diagnostics in the deep tunnels**

The hum of the atmospheric processors filled the tunnel like a mechanical heartbeat—steady, rhythmic, eternal. Dr. Kira Chen pressed her palm against the conduit housing, feeling the vibration travel through her glove, up her arm, settling somewhere in her chest where it matched the tempo of her own pulse.

Level 7. Seventy meters beneath the Hellas Basin colony floor. Down here, the red dust couldn't reach her.

Her headlamp cut a narrow cone through the darkness, illuminating the maze of pipes and cables that threaded through the basalt walls. The air tasted recycled—metallic with a hint of the chemical scrubbers that kept it breathable. She'd designed these processors herself, back when her name still meant something other than *failure*.

"Processor Array Delta-Seven, running diagnostics," she murmured into her comm, though no one was listening. The overnight shift supervisor had stopped checking in on her months ago. Down here, Kira was alone with the machines, and that was exactly how she wanted it.

Her tablet chirped softly. Temperature readings scrolled across the screen in neat columns of green. Pressure valves: nominal. Carbon dioxide conversion: 97.3% efficiency. She allowed herself the ghost of a smile. The systems were perfect because she'd made them perfect. Because she couldn't afford another mistake.

*Twelve people.*

The thought arrived unbidden, as it always did, sharp as a scalpel between her ribs. Twelve faces she'd memorized from the memorial service she hadn't been allowed to attend. Twelve names etched into a monument on Titan, frozen forever in methane ice while she walked free on Mars.

Kira shook her head, forcing her attention back to the tablet. The past was a luxury she couldn't afford. Not when fifty thousand people above her depended on these systems to breathe.

She moved deeper into the tunnel, her boots scuffing against the textured floor panels. The colony had grown beyond anyone's projections—from a research outpost of three hundred to a thriving settlement in just under a decade. They'd even started calling it a city, though Kira avoided the residential levels where families gathered in the biodomes, where children played in artificial parks under simulated sunlight.

She preferred the depths. The honest machinery. The predictable mathematics of airflow and chemical reactions.

Her headlamp caught the junction box for Processor Six, and she knelt beside it, pulling her multi-tool from her belt. The access panel came away with a soft hiss of equalizing pressure. Inside, a tangle of fiber optics glowed like bioluminescent sea creatures in the darkness—blue, amber, steady green.

"Still beautiful," she whispered.

The processors were her children, in a way. More reliable than people. More forgiving than memory.

A notification flashed on her tablet: *ROUTINE MAINTENANCE LOG—LEVEL 7, SECTOR D—DR. K. CHEN—04:47 MARS STANDARD TIME*

Four-forty-seven. The colony above would be stirring now. First shift workers heading to the mining operations. Hydroponics specialists tending the vertical farms. Parents waking children for school. The ordinary rhythm of life she'd helped make possible but no longer participated in.

Kira ran her scanner along the processor's core assembly, watching the readings cascade across her screen. Everything nominal. Everything perfect. Just like yesterday, and the day before, and the three hundred days before that.

She closed the access panel and stood, her knees protesting the cold that seeped through the floor despite the heating elements. The tunnel stretched ahead into darkness, another two kilometers of conduits and junctions to inspect before her shift ended.

Before she had to return to her quarters and face the silence that waited there.

Her tablet chimed—a different tone this time. Kira frowned and pulled it closer. A minor fluctuation in Processor Twelve's output. Probably nothing. A sensor drift, maybe. But she'd learned on Titan that "probably nothing" could become "catastrophic failure" in the space between heartbeats.

She adjusted her course, heading toward the western junction. Her headlamp swept across the tunnel walls, catching the occasional streak of rust-colored dust that had somehow infiltrated even this deep. Mars was patient. Mars always found a way in.

The hum of the processors grew louder as she approached Twelve's housing. She could hear the subtle variance now, a slight irregularity in the rhythm. Her fingers moved across the tablet, pulling up deeper diagnostic layers, searching for the anomaly.

There. A pressure differential in the tertiary exchange chamber. Point-zero-three percent outside normal parameters. Nothing that would trigger an alarm. Nothing that anyone else would even notice.

But Kira noticed everything.

She was reaching for the access panel when her comm crackled to life—the first human voice she'd heard in six hours.

"Dr. Chen, this is Colony Control. Please acknowledge."

Her hand hesitated. They never called her. Not unless—

"Chen here," she said, her voice rough from disuse.

"Ma'am, we're showing some unusual readings on the perimeter sensor array. Probably just a dust storm, but the chief wants all essential personnel to check in. Confirm your location, please."

Kira glanced at the processor housing, then at her tablet. The pressure differential was still there, a tiny imperfection in her perfect system.

"Level 7, Sector D-West. Running standard diagnostics. Everything nominal down here."

"Copy that, Doctor. Stay on comms, please. We're getting some... hold on."

Static filled the line. Kira waited, her engineer's mind already running through scenarios. Dust storms were common, but the perimeter sensors were designed to filter out atmospheric interference. Unusual readings meant—

The comm exploded with noise—shouting, alarms, a sound like thunder that couldn't exist in Mars's thin atmosphere.

"—multiple contacts—not a storm—*Jesus Christ they're firing*—"

Then silence.

Kira's tablet slipped from her fingers, clattering against the tunnel floor. Above her, through seventy meters of rock and steel and the carefully constructed layers of humanity's greatest achievement on Mars, something had just gone terribly, impossibly wrong.

And she was alone in the dark with the machines that kept fifty thousand people alive.

**Scene 2: Kira reluctantly takes a comm ...**

**Scene 2: Kira reluctantly takes a comm call from her supervisor**

The diagnostic hum died to silence, leaving only the whisper of air cycling through the tunnel's ventilation ducts. Kira pulled off her gloves and reached for her water canister when her comm unit chirped—the insistent triple-tone that meant Marcus Webb was calling from Administration.

She considered ignoring it. Marcus would understand. He always understood, which somehow made it worse.

The chirping continued. Kira sighed and tapped her temple interface.

"Chen here."

"Kira! Good, you're still down there." Marcus's voice carried that carefully calibrated warmth that colony administrators practiced—friendly but professional, concerned but not intrusive. She'd heard it a thousand times in the three years since she'd arrived on Mars. "I was hoping to catch you before you went full hermit mode for the day."

"I'm running level-seven diagnostics on the atmospheric processors," Kira said, keeping her tone neutral. "The flow variance I mentioned last week is still within acceptable parameters, but I want to—"

"The processors are fine, Kira. They're always fine. You built them too well." A pause. "Listen, I'm calling about tonight. The anniversary celebration. We'd really like to see you there."

Kira pressed her fingers against the cool metal of the tunnel wall, feeling the almost imperceptible vibration of the colony's heartbeat—fifty thousand people living, breathing, consuming oxygen and water and power. All of it flowing through systems she'd designed, calibrated, obsessively maintained.

"I don't do well at celebrations, Marcus. You know that."

"I know you *think* you don't." His voice softened. "But Kira, it's been three years. The colony is thriving. Hellas Basin is everything the Mars Compact promised it would be. Hell, it's better. We've got actual families here now. Kids born on Martian soil. The hydroponics expansion is exceeding projections. And the atmospheric processors—*your* processors—are running at ninety-eight percent efficiency. That's unheard of."

She closed her eyes. In the darkness behind her eyelids, she saw Titan's methane clouds, heard the screaming over the comm channels, watched pressure readouts plummet as twelve people died because she'd missed something, overlooked some critical variable in her beautiful, elegant design.

"Marcus—"

"I'm not trying to push," he said, though they both knew he was. "I just think it might be good for you to see what you've helped build here. Not from down in the tunnels, but up here with the rest of us. Real people, Kira. Living real lives. Because of you."

Through the tunnel's maintenance viewport, Kira could see the primary atmospheric processor—a cathedral of gleaming titanium and carbon fiber, its exchange membranes cycling with mechanical precision. Red emergency lighting bathed everything in shades of rust and blood.

"I'll think about it," she said.

"That's all I ask." Marcus's relief was audible. "The celebration starts at eighteen hundred in Central Plaza. Governor Okonkwo is giving a speech, there'll be food from the new cultivation domes, and Chen Zhao is bringing out his experimental whiskey. The stuff he's been aging in the low pressure storage."

Despite herself, Kira felt a flicker of curiosity. Chen Zhao—no relation, though they'd joked about it—had been trying to perfect Martian whiskey for two years, claiming the lower gravity would create unique molecular structures in the aging process.

"Experimental whiskey sounds like a medical emergency waiting to happen."

Marcus laughed. "That's the spirit. Sort of. Look, just... show up. Have one drink. Let people see you're not actually a ghost haunting the maintenance tunnels."

"Some days I'm not sure I'm not," Kira muttered.

"What was that?"

"Nothing. I need to finish these diagnostics."

"Right. Of course." Another pause. "Kira? For what it's worth, nobody here blames you for Titan. That was Earth. This is Mars. Different world, different life. You're allowed to have one."

The words landed like small stones in still water, rippling through her carefully constructed defenses. Kira's throat tightened.

"Eighteen hundred," Marcus continued. "Central Plaza. I'll save you a glass of potentially lethal whiskey."

"I said I'd think about it."

"I know. But I also know you're too brilliant to make the same mistake twice. And hiding down there? That's a mistake, Kira. Trust me."

The comm clicked off before she could respond. Kira stood in the red-lit tunnel, surrounded by the machinery that kept fifty thousand people alive, and felt the familiar weight settle back onto her shoulders. The weight of responsibility. Of guilt. Of the gap between the brilliant, confident engineer she'd been and the hollow, careful ghost she'd become.

Above her, through hundreds of meters of Martian rock and reinforced habitat modules, the colony prepared for celebration. Children played in pressurized gardens. Couples planned their evening. Marcus probably believed she'd actually show up, that his gentle manipulation had worked.

Kira pulled her gloves back on and returned to her diagnostics. The numbers didn't lie, didn't judge, didn't expect her to be anything other than precise. Down here in the deep tunnels, she could be useful without being seen.

It was enough. It had to be enough.

Her tablet chimed with a new data stream from Processor Seven. Flow rates, temperature gradients, pressure differentials—all within normal parameters. All perfect. All because she'd learned from her mistakes, had built redundancy upon redundancy, had checked and rechecked every calculation until her eyes burned and her hands shook.

Never again, she'd promised herself. Never again would people die because of her oversight.

The tunnel stretched ahead, deeper into the colony's infrastructure. Kira checked her oxygen levels—six hours remaining—and started walking. There were always more systems to check, more variables to monitor. The work was endless, and she was grateful for it.

Behind her, the atmospheric processor hummed its steady rhythm, breathing life into the Martian desert. Above, the colony celebrated its success, unaware of the woman in the tunnels who couldn't let herself believe in it.

The comm unit on her wrist displayed the time: 14:37. Three hours and twenty-three minutes until the celebration began. Kira told herself she wouldn't go, knew Marcus would be disappointed but understanding, and tried to ignore the small, stubborn part of her that wondered what Chen Zhao's whiskey might taste like.

She had work to do. The numbers were waiting.

**Scene 3: Kira ascends to Level 3 for a ...**

**Scene 3: Kira ascends to Level 3 for a scheduled inspection**

The lift hummed beneath Kira's boots as it carried her upward through the colony's circulatory system. She watched the depth counter tick backward—minus-forty-two meters, minus-thirty-eight—each number bringing her closer to the populated levels she typically avoided.

The doors parted at Level 5 with a pneumatic sigh.

Sound hit her first. The deep tunnels held only the mechanical breathing of processors and the echo of her own footsteps, but here—here was life. Children's laughter ricocheted off composite walls. Somewhere, music played, something with drums and a stringed instrument she couldn't name. The air itself felt different, warmer, carrying the mingled scents of cooking spices, recycled water from the public fountains, and the faint mineral tang that no filtration system could completely scrub from Mars.

Kira stepped into the main transit corridor, her tablet clutched like a shield against her chest.

The corridor stretched a hundred meters in either direction, its walls lined with residential pods stacked three high. Viewscreens mounted every ten meters displayed rotating images of Earth—forests, oceans, cities at night—a reminder of home for those who'd never stopped thinking of it that way. Kira had disabled the screen in her own quarters years ago.

A woman emerged from a nearby pod, herding two small children ahead of her. The boy, maybe six, wore a shirt emblazoned with the Hellas Basin Rovers logo. The girl clutched a stuffed animal that might have been a dog, or possibly a bear—the red dust that permeated everything had stained it the same russet as the Martian surface.

"Aito, slow down!" the mother called in Japanese-accented English. "Your sister can't keep up."

The boy stopped, bouncing on his toes with barely contained energy. "But Mom, if we're late, we won't get the good seats for the greenhouse viewing!"

Kira pressed herself against the wall as they passed, making herself small. The mother offered a polite nod. Kira returned it, then looked away, focusing on her tablet's screen as if something urgent demanded her attention.

She moved deeper into the corridor, navigating the morning flow of colonists beginning their day. A group of engineers in matching jumpsuits discussed water reclamation efficiency in rapid Mandarin. An elderly man pushed a cart loaded with hydroponic vegetables toward the market level, the greens so vibrant they seemed to glow against the corridor's neutral tones. Two teenagers leaned against a wall, their heads close together, whispering and laughing about something that made them both blush.

Fifty thousand people. Fifty thousand lives woven together in this impossible place, three hundred million kilometers from the world that had birthed them. They'd built something here that mattered—not just survival, but community. Culture. Home.

Kira had helped build the systems that kept them breathing. The atmospheric processors, the backup oxygen generation, the emergency protocols that would trigger if pressure dropped or toxicity spiked. Her designs. Her equations. Her expertise, salvaged from the wreckage of her reputation.

But she'd never let herself be part of what those systems protected.

She reached the junction point at the corridor's midpoint, where a maintenance access panel waited behind a yellow-striped barrier. Her fingers moved automatically through the unlock sequence, muscle memory from a thousand similar inspections. The panel swung open, revealing the junction box's nest of fiber optics and sensor arrays.

"Excuse me? Dr. Chen?"

Kira's hand froze on the diagnostic scanner. She turned slowly.

A young man stood behind her, maybe twenty-five, with dark skin and nervous eyes. He wore the gray coveralls of the agricultural division. "I'm sorry to bother you. I just—I wanted to say thank you. For the work you do. My daughter, she has asthma, and the air quality here, it's better than anything we could have afforded Earth-side. The doctors say she'll probably grow out of it completely. Because of the filtration systems you designed."

Kira's throat tightened. "The whole engineering team—"

"But you're the lead atmospheric specialist. Everyone knows." He smiled, genuine and warm. "So, thank you. Really."

He walked away before she could respond, rejoining a woman and a small girl waiting by the lift entrance. The girl coughed into her hand, then laughed at something her mother said.

Kira watched them disappear into the lift. Then she turned back to her inspection, blinking against the unexpected sting in her eyes.

The junction box readings scrolled across her tablet. All nominal. Pressure steady. Air quality optimal. Everything functioning exactly as designed.

She logged the inspection and sealed the panel, then continued toward the Level 3 access shaft. The corridor grew more crowded as she approached the main hub—the heart of the colony where the commercial district, medical center, and administrative offices converged. A man sold coffee from a cart, the synthetic beans genetically modified to grow in Martian greenhouses. The aroma was almost right, close enough to trigger memory.

Near the hub entrance, a school group clustered around their teacher, a tall woman with silver-streaked hair pulled into a bun. The children—maybe eight or nine years old—wore matching red jackets, their excited chatter creating a wall of sound.

"—and tomorrow we'll tour the water reclamation facility," the teacher was saying. "Who can tell me why water is our most precious resource on Mars?"

Hands shot up. A girl with braids called out without waiting to be chosen: "Because we can't make more! We have to reuse everything!"

"Exactly right, Mei. Every drop of water in this colony has been used hundreds of times. The shower you took this morning? That water might have been someone's drinking water last week, and before that—"

"That's gross!" a boy shouted, and the group dissolved into giggles.

The teacher smiled. "That's survival. That's what makes us Martians instead of just tourists."

Kira slipped past them, unnoticed. The Level 3 access shaft waited beyond the hub, a service corridor that would take her up to the atmospheric processor junction points where the real work waited.

Behind her, the colony hummed with life—fifty thousand heartbeats, fifty thousand reasons her systems couldn't fail.

She'd lost twelve people on Titan because she'd missed something, trusted a calculation that proved fatally flawed.

She wouldn't miss anything here.

The shaft door closed behind her, muffling the sounds of the colony. Kira climbed the ladder toward Level 3, leaving the warmth and noise below, returning to the solitary work that was all she'd allow herself.

Above, through meters of regolith and composite shielding, the Martian sun climbed higher in the crimson sky, illuminating a morning that seemed like any other.

**Scene 4: While working on the atmospher...**

**Scene 4: While working on the atmospheric junction...**

The junction's cooling manifold hissed like a sleeping dragon as Kira recalibrated the pressure sensors. Her tablet displayed a cascade of green indicators—all systems nominal, atmospheric composition holding steady at Earth-standard within acceptable tolerances. She should have felt satisfaction. Instead, she felt the familiar hollowness of routine masking purpose.

She was reaching for the next diagnostic port when her geological survey array—a pet project she'd installed six months ago to monitor subsurface stability—chirped an alert.

Kira frowned. The array wasn't supposed to be active. She'd set it to passive monitoring only, conserving power after Operations had denied her request for a dedicated sensor grid. Someone must have bumped the settings during the last maintenance cycle.

She pulled up the readout, intending to silence it and return to her actual work.

The numbers stopped her cold.

Deep-penetration radar had detected something at 847 meters below the colony's foundation. The density readings were all wrong—too regular, too geometric. Natural basalt formations didn't create perfect ninety-degree angles. Lava tubes didn't arrange themselves in concentric circles spanning two hundred meters.

Kira zoomed in on the spectral analysis. The material composition was Martian—iron oxide, olivine, pyroxene—but the structural arrangement defied geological explanation. It looked almost like... architecture.

Her heart rate ticked upward. She ran the scan again, checking for equipment malfunction. The atmospheric processor's steady thrum seemed to fade as she focused on the screen. Condensation dripped somewhere in the darkness beyond her work light, counting seconds.

The second scan confirmed the first.

"What are you?" she whispered.

She pulled up the colony's geological survey database, searching for any previous mention of anomalous structures in this sector. Nothing. The initial site surveys had been thorough—they'd mapped the entire basin before breaking ground. How had they missed something this substantial?

Unless it hadn't been there to find.

No. That was ridiculous. Structures didn't just appear. More likely the survey equipment had been calibrated for different parameters, filtering out readings that didn't match expected geological patterns.

Kira's fingers flew across her tablet, adjusting the array's settings to map the full extent of the anomaly. The processor's rhythmic breathing filled the silence as data compiled. She should report this. Protocol demanded it. But she could already hear Director Voss's dismissive tone, see his expression when she interrupted his schedule with "unusual readings" from unauthorized equipment.

Better to gather real data first. Something concrete. Something they couldn't ignore.

The mapping completed. Kira stared at the three-dimensional render rotating on her screen. The structure—if that's what it was—extended in a spoke-like pattern radiating from a central hub. The symmetry was perfect. Too perfect.

Her scientific training warred with the implications. Mars was dead. Had been dead for billions of years. The idea of artificial structures predating human colonization was the domain of fringe theorists and bad science fiction.

Yet there it was, rendered in false-color topography on her tablet. Undeniable.

She saved the data to an encrypted partition and set the array to continuous monitoring. Whatever this was, it had waited beneath the Martian regolith for eons. It could wait a few more hours while she finished her shift and compiled a proper analysis.

Kira returned to the atmospheric sensors, but her hands moved automatically now, her mind elsewhere. Deep beneath her feet, something impossible waited in the ancient dark. Something that suggested humanity's greatest achievement—taming the Red Planet—had been built on top of a mystery they'd never suspected existed.

She checked her chronometer. Four hours until shift end. Four hours to decide how to present this without sounding like she'd succumbed to isolation psychosis.

The processor hummed its mechanical lullaby, oblivious to the questions multiplying in Kira's mind. Above, fifty thousand colonists went about their morning routines, equally unaware that their chief atmospheric engineer had just detected something that would rewrite everything they thought they knew about Mars.

If she was right.

If the readings were real.

If—

Her tablet chimed. A priority message from Operations: atmospheric composition readings requested for the morning briefing. Routine. Expected. Normal.

Kira sent the data with practiced efficiency and returned to her diagnostics, but part of her attention remained fixed on that encrypted partition, on the impossible geometry waiting in the deep places of an ancient world.

She didn't know that in less than three hours, the mystery beneath her feet would be the least of her concerns.

She didn't know that someone else already knew what she'd found.

And she didn't know that humanity's time on Mars was being measured in minutes, not years.

The atmospheric processor breathed. The colony lived. And far above, beyond the protective dome and the thin Martian atmosphere, something crimson and terrible was beginning its descent.

**Scene 5: Without warning, emergency ala...**

**Scene 5: Without Warning**

The shriek of the emergency klaxons split the air like a blade.

Kira's hands froze on the diagnostic panel, her entire body going rigid as the sound hammered through the maintenance tunnel. Not the soft chime of a systems alert. Not the measured pulse of a scheduled drill. This was the colony-wide alarm—the one she'd heard only twice before in three years, both times for atmospheric breaches that turned out to be sensor malfunctions.

The overhead lights shifted from warm white to pulsing amber.

"All personnel, this is Colony Control." The voice crackling through the comm system belonged to Marcus Webb, the settlement's director. His usual measured tone had cracked at the edges. "We are under attack. I repeat, we are under attack. Proceed immediately to designated shelters. This is not a drill."

Under attack.

The words didn't make sense. Mars had no hostile wildlife, no competing colonies within three thousand kilometers. The only conflicts in the Hellas Basin were bureaucratic ones—water allocation disputes and mining rights arguments settled in conference rooms, not with weapons.

Kira's training kicked in before her conscious mind caught up. She pulled up the security feed interface on her tablet, fingers moving with practiced efficiency even as her pulse thundered in her ears. The screen flickered, then resolved into a grid of camera views from across the colony.

The central plaza feed showed colonists running. Not the orderly evacuation pattern from the drills, but pure chaos—people scattering like disturbed insects, children being swept up by parents, market stalls overturning as bodies collided with them. Kira increased the volume, and the sounds of screaming filtered through the tinny speakers.

Then the sky caught fire.

Brilliant lances of superheated plasma streaked down from the rust-colored heavens, each impact erupting in a blossom of white-hot destruction. The greenhouse dome—three hectares of carefully cultivated crops that fed a quarter of the colony—simply ceased to exist, replaced by a roiling fireball that sent debris spinning outward in lazy Martian gravity.

"No," Kira whispered. "No, no, no."

She switched feeds frantically. The northern residential sector: burning. The water reclamation facility: a crater. The medical center—

A shadow fell across one of the exterior cameras, and Kira's breath caught.

The craft descending through the thin atmosphere was unlike anything in the colony's fleet. Angular and predatory, its hull was covered in overlapping scales that caught the light like polished obsidian. As she watched, ports along its flanks irised open, and more plasma bolts lanced downward, each one finding a target with surgical precision. The communications array. The solar farm. The western airlock.

They weren't just attacking. They were systematically dismantling the colony's infrastructure.

More ships appeared, smaller ones peeling off from the larger craft like remora from a shark. These dove lower, and Kira caught her first clear view of the attackers through a rooftop camera. Bipedal, moving with fluid grace despite their bulk, covered in what looked like natural armor plating. Saurian. The word rose unbidden from some half-remembered intelligence briefing she'd skimmed years ago. The Collective had been mentioned as a distant concern, a territorial species humanity had encountered at the edges of explored space.

Distant. Not here. Not Mars.

One of the creatures raised a weapon—organic-looking, grown rather than built—and fired at a cluster of colonists trying to reach a shelter entrance. The plasma bolt hit the reinforced door, and the feed went white before cutting to static.

Kira cycled through camera after camera, each view worse than the last. The market sector was an inferno. Bodies lay in the streets, some moving, some terribly still. A woman she recognized—Yuki from hydroponics, who always had a smile and a bad joke—was dragging an injured man toward cover when another plasma strike turned them both to ash.

The tablet slipped from Kira's trembling hands, clattering against the metal grating.

This couldn't be happening. Shouldn't be happening. The colony had no military value, no strategic importance. They were farmers and scientists and engineers, fifty thousand people just trying to survive on a dead world. Why would anyone—

The maintenance tunnel shuddered.

Dust rained from the ceiling as a deep boom resonated through the bedrock. Another explosion, close enough that Kira felt it in her chest. The lights flickered, and for one horrible moment she thought the power grid was going down, but the emergency batteries kicked in and the amber glow returned.

She snatched up the tablet with shaking hands. The main colony network was fragmenting—feeds dropping offline one by one as infrastructure failed. But the deep maintenance systems ran on isolated circuits, hardened against exactly this kind of catastrophic failure. Her circuits. Her design.

A new voice cut through the chaos on the comm channel. "—breach at Airlock Seven, they're coming through—" The transmission dissolved into weapons fire and screaming.

Kira's mind raced. She was three levels down, in tunnels that most colonists didn't even know existed. The atmospheric processors, the water mains, the geothermal taps—all the vital systems that kept the colony alive ran through this subterranean maze. If the attackers were systematic, and they clearly were, they'd target these next.

She needed to move. Needed to reach a shelter, or better yet, one of the emergency evac tunnels that led to the backup habitats in the canyon walls. But her legs wouldn't cooperate. She stood frozen, watching the feeds, watching her home burn.

On one of the remaining exterior cameras, the largest Saurian craft settled onto the colony's landing pad with ponderous grace. A hatch dilated in its belly, and more troops poured out, these ones carrying different weapons—not plasma rifles but something that looked like containment equipment.

They weren't just destroying the colony.

They were taking it.

The realization cut through Kira's paralysis like ice water. She killed the feeds, shoved the tablet into her tool bag, and ran.

Behind her, deeper in the tunnel, something exploded with enough force to knock her off her feet.

**Scene 6: As explosions rock the upper l...**

**Scene 6: As explosions rock the upper levels**

The tunnel shuddered. Dust rained from the ceiling in ghostly curtains, catching the emergency lighting in amber streaks. Kira's fingers froze over the diagnostic panel as another tremor rolled through the bedrock—deeper this time, closer.

On the security feed grid, camera seventeen dissolved into static. Then twelve. Then nine.

She watched the colony die in real-time across sixteen flickering screens.

Section Four's residential dome was simply *gone*, replaced by a crater that vented atmosphere in a screaming white plume. The feed from the eastern greenhouse showed figures running—so many figures—before something bright and terrible swept across the frame and the image cut to black.

Kira's hand moved to the comm panel. Stopped. Moved again.

"—need medical at the primary shelter—"

"—hull breach on levels six through nine—"

"—where's the fucking militia—"

The voices overlapped, frantic, human. Someone was crying. A child, maybe. The audio clipped and distorted as too many people tried to transmit at once.

Her fingers hovered over the emergency response channel. She'd drilled for this. Every colonist had. Her role was clear: maintenance personnel proceed to designated rally points, assist with evacuation protocols, provide infrastructure support.

Another explosion. The lights flickered. When they steadied, half the security feeds showed only snow.

Kira pulled up the structural integrity overlay. Red bloomed across the schematic like blood in water. The upper levels were compromised—not just damaged, but *gone*. The main shelters, the ones designed to hold five thousand people each, showed catastrophic pressure loss.

Five thousand people.

She thought of Titan. The way the ice had groaned before it gave way. The fourteen seconds between the first alarm and total structural failure. Not enough time to think. Barely enough time to scream.

Twelve dead. Her fault. Her calculations, her oversight, her arrogance in thinking she'd accounted for every variable.

"—maintenance personnel, respond—" Marcus Webb's voice cut through the chaos, steady despite the static. "—need damage assessment on atmospheric processors—Kira, if you're hearing this—"

Her hand was on the transmit button. She could feel the ridged plastic under her thumb.

The tunnel shook again. Somewhere above, metal shrieked as it tore. The sound carried through the rock itself, a subsonic moan that she felt in her bones.

On screen six, a Saurian drop ship settled over the central plaza like a hunting bird. Its weapons ports were still glowing.

Kira's thumb lifted from the transmit button.

She pulled up the emergency protocols instead, her hands moving with the mechanical precision of someone not quite inhabiting their own body. The deep maintenance tunnels had their own shelter systems—redundant life support, independent power, blast doors rated for meteor impact. They were designed to keep critical personnel alive long enough to restore colony functions after a catastrophic event.

They were designed to keep *her* alive.

"—Marcus to all stations, we're implementing full evacuation—" His voice was thinner now, stretched tight. "—proceed to secondary shelters, I repeat—"

The transmission dissolved into a squeal of interference.

Kira brought up the tunnel's blast door controls. Six emergency bulkheads, each capable of sealing off a section of the maintenance network. She could isolate herself in the deep core, surrounded by the atmospheric processors and water recyclers and all the beautiful, reliable machinery that had never failed her.

Not like people failed. Not like she'd failed.

"Kira!" Marcus again, barely audible through the static. "Kira, we need—"

She closed the first bulkhead.

The hydraulics hissed, and two tons of reinforced steel slid into place with a sound like a vault door closing. The noise from above became muffled, distant. The screaming on the comm channels faded to ghosts.

Second bulkhead. Third.

On the security feeds, something was burning in the residential sector. She could see figures silhouetted against the flames, running or falling or simply standing still. It was hard to tell at this resolution.

Fourth bulkhead. Fifth.

"—anyone in the lower tunnels—" A woman's voice, unfamiliar. Young. "—we're trapped in junction seven, the stairs collapsed—please, if anyone—"

Kira's hand trembled over the final bulkhead control.

Junction seven was three hundred meters up-tunnel. Maybe five minutes at a run. The route was clear on her schematic—no breaches, no structural damage. She could reach them. Bring them down to the deep core, seal them in with her.

Another explosion rolled through the bedrock. The lights went red, then amber, then settled into the dim emergency mode that painted everything the color of old blood.

On screen three, the ceiling of the main concourse was collapsing. She watched it fall in terrible slow motion, a wave of concrete and steel that swallowed everything beneath it.

Fourteen seconds. That's all it had taken on Titan.

She closed the sixth bulkhead.

The sound of the colony died. The tunnel became a tomb of silence, broken only by the steady hum of the processors and the whisper of recycled air through the vents. The security feeds still flickered on the wall, but Kira couldn't look at them anymore.

She slid down the wall until she was sitting on the cold floor, her back against metal that thrummed with the heartbeat of machinery. Her own heart was racing, a panicked flutter that made her vision swim.

The comm panel crackled. "—junction seven, please—" The woman's voice was quieter now, hoarse. "—is anyone—"

Kira reached up and switched off the receiver.

The silence was absolute.

She sat in the darkness between the emergency lights, surrounded by the infrastructure she'd built with her own hands. The atmospheric processors cycled faithfully, scrubbing CO2, generating oxygen, maintaining the precise balance of gases that kept human lungs working in the Martian deep. The water recyclers hummed their endless song. The power conduits carried electricity from the fusion reactor five levels down, reliable and constant and utterly indifferent to the death happening above.

It was beautiful, in its way. Clean. Predictable.

Safe.

Kira pulled her knees to her chest and pressed her forehead against them. She was shaking, though the temperature was perfectly regulated at twenty-one degrees Celsius. Her breath came in short, sharp gasps that the processors would dutifully convert back into breathable air.

She was alive.

She was alone.

And somewhere above, in the ruins of Hellas Basin, the screaming had finally stopped.

The emergency lighting cast her shadow long and thin across the tunnel floor, a dark shape that flickered with each pulse of the amber LEDs. The processors hummed. The recyclers whispered. The colony's infrastructure worked exactly as designed, maintaining perfect conditions for the survival of Dr. Kira Chen.

The only person left alive to appreciate it.

She closed her eyes and tried not to count the seconds.
