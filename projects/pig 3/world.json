Oakhaven is divided into distinct districts, including the older, historical district with cobblestone streets and brownstone buildings, a modern downtown with towering skyscrapers and glass facades, and quieter residential neighborhoods with tree-lined avenues. The city is nestled in a valley, surrounded by rolling hills that are slowly giving way to suburban sprawl. To the east of Oakhaven lies the sprawling Evergreen Farms region, a patchwork of agricultural land that supplies much of the city's food. This is where Arnie's original farm is located. Small pockets of natural areas, such as Oakhaven Central Park and the Ash River Greenway, provide limited green spaces within the city limits. Oakhaven experiences a temperate climate with four distinct seasons. Summers are warm and humid, with average temperatures in the low 80s Fahrenheit. Winters are cold and snowy, with temperatures often dipping below freezing. Spring and autumn are mild and pleasant, with vibrant foliage displays.

Unexpected flash floods along the River Ash are also a potential hazard due to outdated infrastructure. Beyond the districts of Oakhaven, the surrounding region includes smaller towns and villages scattered throughout Evergreen Farms.
