## Chapter 1: The Assignment

**Scene 1: Max Monroe is abruptly pulled from a surveillance operation in Prague**

The extraction came without warning.

Max Monroe had been sitting in a cramped Škoda across from the Hotel Paris for eleven hours when his encrypted phone vibrated once—the recall signal. No explanation. No context. Just the single pulse that meant drop everything and move.

He'd left the vehicle running, the keys in the ignition for the cleanup team that would materialize within minutes. By dawn, it would be as if he'd never been in Prague at all.

Now, twenty-three hours later, his body still operated on Central European Time while his mind tried to catch up with the fluorescent reality of Langley, Virginia. The Gulfstream had touched down at 2:47 AM, and Max had been shuttled directly from the private airstrip to CIA headquarters in an unmarked SUV with windows tinted black enough to violate civilian traffic laws.

The building loomed against the night sky, a brutalist monument to secrets. At this hour, most of its windows were dark, but Max knew the real work happened in rooms without windows at all.

"ID and credentials," the guard at the first checkpoint said, his voice flat with the particular boredom of the graveyard shift.

Max slid his badge across the scanner. The red light turned green with a soft beep that seemed too cheerful for the setting.

"Proceed to elevator bank C. You're cleared for sub-level three."

Sub-level three. Max felt something tighten in his chest—not quite anxiety, but its more sophisticated cousin. In his eight years with the agency, he'd been to sub-level three exactly twice. Both times had resulted in operations that didn't officially exist.

The elevator descended with the smooth, expensive silence of German engineering. Max caught his reflection in the polished steel doors—forty-eight hours of stubble, eyes red-rimmed from the overnight flight, his leather jacket creased from being slept in. He looked exactly like what he was: a man pulled from the field without time to prepare.

The doors opened onto a corridor that smelled of recycled air and floor polish. Track lighting cast everything in a sterile glow. Another guard waited, this one younger, his hand resting with practiced casualness near his sidearm.

"Mr. Monroe. This way, please."

They walked in silence, their footsteps muffled by industrial carpet the color of dried blood. Max counted the doors they passed—twelve on the left, nine on the right—a habit from training that had become reflex. Know your exits. Always.

The guard stopped at an unmarked door, swiped his own credentials, then stepped aside. "Director Voss is waiting."

Sabine Voss. Max's handler for the past three years, though "handler" felt too simple a word for their relationship. She was the voice in his ear during operations, the strategist who'd kept him alive in Caracas, the woman who'd once told him he had a gift for making people believe his lies.

He'd never been sure if she meant it as a compliment.

The guard's hand moved to the door handle, but Max caught the subtle shift in his posture—the slight tension in his shoulders, the way his eyes didn't quite meet Max's. Whatever waited on the other side of that door, even the security detail had been briefed enough to be nervous.

"Thank you," Max said, keeping his voice neutral.

The guard nodded and opened the door.

The briefing room beyond was smaller than Max expected, dominated by a single conference table of polished mahogany. No windows, as he'd predicted. The walls were bare except for a digital clock displaying 03:17 in red numerals and a flat-screen monitor, currently dark.

Director Sabine Voss stood at the far end of the table, her back to him, studying something on a tablet. She wore a charcoal suit despite the hour, her black hair pulled back in a style that was both severe and elegant. When she turned, her expression was unreadable—a skill Max recognized because he'd spent years perfecting it himself.

"Max. Thank you for coming on such short notice."

As if he'd had a choice.

"Prague was just getting interesting," he said, closing the door behind him. The lock engaged with a soft click that seemed to seal them off from the rest of the world.

"Prague is handled. We have other priorities." She gestured to a chair. "Sit. We don't have much time, and you need to be wheels-up for Vienna in six hours."

Vienna.

Max remained standing, his instincts firing warning signals. "What's in Vienna?"

Sabine Voss's eyes met his, and in them he saw something that made his pulse quicken—not fear exactly, but the recognition of a particularly dangerous game about to begin.

"Your next assignment," she said, pressing a button on the table. The monitor flickered to life, displaying a photograph of a woman with dark hair and eyes the color of Arctic ice. "And possibly the most important operation of your career."

Max looked at the face on the screen, committing it to memory even as questions multiplied in his mind.

"Her name is Roxana Volkov," Sabine continued, her voice taking on the clipped efficiency of a briefing. "And for the next six weeks, she's going to be the center of your world."

**Scene 2: Director Sabine Voss briefs Max on Operation Nightfall**

The briefing room existed in a state of perpetual twilight. No windows interrupted the charcoal-gray walls, and the overhead lights—recessed and clinical—cast everything in a bluish pallor that reminded Max of a morgue. He'd been in this room dozens of times before, but it never felt less sterile, less designed to strip away anything resembling comfort or distraction.

Director Sabine Voss stood at the head of the obsidian conference table, her fingers resting lightly on a manila folder stamped with red diagonal stripes. She hadn't opened it yet. That was deliberate—Sabine never did anything without intention.

"Operation Nightfall," she said, her voice carrying the particular flatness of someone delivering bad news they'd already made peace with. "Viktor Volkov. Russian diplomat, Vienna station. On paper, he's a cultural attaché coordinating educational exchanges. In reality, he's a procurement officer."

She slid the folder across the table. It whispered against the polished surface.

Max didn't reach for it immediately. "Procurement of what?"

"NATO tactical communications protocols. Troop movement schedules for the Baltics. Satellite encryption keys." Sabine's dark eyes held his without blinking. "The kind of intelligence that gets people killed. Entire units, if deployed correctly."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop. Max opened the folder. The first photograph showed a man in his late forties—thick neck, receding hairline, the kind of face that disappeared in crowds. Viktor Volkov looked like an accountant, not a traitor.

"We've had him under surveillance for eight months," Sabine continued, moving to the wall-mounted screen. She tapped her tablet, and the display illuminated with a web of connections—names, dates, locations linked by color-coded lines. "He's careful. Doesn't use digital communication for anything sensitive. No dead drops we can find. His diplomatic immunity means we can't touch him directly, and the Austrians won't move without concrete proof."

Max studied the surveillance photos cycling across the screen. Viktor at a café, Viktor entering the Russian embassy, Viktor at the opera. Always alone or with other diplomats. Nothing incriminating.

"Traditional methods have failed," Sabine said, and there was something almost like frustration in her voice—a hairline crack in her professional veneer. "We've tried everything short of breaking into the embassy itself. Which, as I'm sure I don't need to remind you, would be an act of war."

"So where does the proof live?" Max asked, though he suspected he already knew the answer.

Sabine changed the image. A study materialized on screen—dark wood paneling, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, a antique desk positioned beneath a window. The photograph had been taken from an extreme angle, probably from a building across the street with a telephoto lens.

"Viktor's private study in his residence. Separate from the embassy. We have thermal imaging that shows he spends two to three hours there most evenings. Alone." She zoomed in on the desk. "We believe he keeps physical copies of the documents there. Photographs them, then passes the images during in-person meetings we can't monitor."

Max leaned back in his chair, the leather creaking softly. "You need someone inside the residence."

"We need someone who can get inside without raising suspicion. Someone Viktor would never suspect." Sabine's expression remained neutral, but her next words carried weight. "We need his wife to do it for us."

The screen changed again. This time, a woman appeared—late thirties, dark hair swept back from a face that suggested intelligence more than conventional beauty. High cheekbones, observant eyes, a slight asymmetry to her smile that made it seem genuine. She wore a navy dress at what looked like a gallery opening, holding a glass of wine, caught mid-conversation.

"Roxana Volkov," Sabine said. "Née Morozova. Former art history professor at Moscow State University. Married Viktor five years ago. No children. No known political affiliations. By all accounts, she's a civilian who married into a world she doesn't fully understand."

Max studied Roxana's face. There was something in her eyes—a distance, maybe loneliness. Or perhaps he was projecting what he needed to see.

"She has unrestricted access to the study?" he asked.

"According to our surveillance, yes. She's often home alone while Viktor works late. We've observed her entering the study on multiple occasions." Sabine paused. "She's also been attending cultural events solo with increasing frequency. The marriage appears... strained."

Max heard what she wasn't saying. A lonely wife. An absent husband. A classic access point.

"You want me to recruit her," he said.

"I want you to get close to her. Gain her trust. Convince her to photograph the documents in Viktor's study." Sabine's voice hardened. "Viktor is scheduled for transfer to Beijing in six weeks. Once he's in China, he'll be completely beyond our reach, and the intelligence pipeline continues. This is our window."

Six weeks. Max had worked faster timelines, but not often, and never with stakes this high.

"What's her vulnerability?" he asked, falling into the operational calculus that had defined his career. Everyone had one—the crack in the foundation you could exploit.

Sabine pulled up another series of images. Roxana at a museum, Roxana at a concert, Roxana sitting alone at a café with a book. Always alone. Always that same distant expression.

"Isolation," Sabine said. "She left her career, her friends, her entire life in Moscow when she married Viktor. She speaks limited German. Her social circle consists almost entirely of other diplomatic wives she has nothing in common with. She's intellectually starved and emotionally neglected."

"So I become what she's missing." Max closed the folder. "How do you want the approach?"

"Organic. Natural. Nothing that could trigger suspicion." Sabine turned off the screen, and the room seemed darker without its glow. "There's a lecture series at the Kunsthistorisches Museum starting next week. 'Renaissance Patronage and Power.' Roxana has attended every session of similar series for the past two years. You'll be there."

Max nodded slowly, the operation taking shape in his mind. The accidental meeting. The shared interest. The gradual building of trust. It was a familiar choreography, one he'd performed before, though never with consequences quite this severe.

"What's the authorization level?" he asked.

Sabine met his eyes, and for a moment, the professional mask slipped enough for him to see the weight she carried. "This comes from the top, Max. The Director of National Intelligence is personally monitoring this operation. The NATO Secretary General has been briefed. If Volkov's intelligence reaches the wrong hands before we can shut him down..." She didn't finish the sentence. She didn't need to.

Max felt the familiar tightening in his chest—the physical manifestation of responsibility settling onto his shoulders. People would die if he failed. Maybe not immediately, maybe not in ways he'd ever see, but they would die nonetheless.

"I'll need full operational support," he said. "Legend, cover story, technical assets."

"Already prepared. You're Dr. Maxwell Morrison, visiting fellow at the University of Vienna, researching Baroque art patronage. Published academic, independently wealthy, recently divorced." Sabine slid another folder across the table, thicker than the first. "Your legend has been backstopped for five years. Publications, conference appearances, even a ex-wife in Boston who'll confirm the story if anyone checks."

"Thorough."

"This operation doesn't have room for mistakes." Sabine's voice softened fractionally. "I know what I'm asking, Max. I know this kind of mission takes a toll."

Max thought about Roxana's photograph—that distant look in her eyes, the loneliness he recognized because he'd weaponized it before. He thought about Viktor, who looked like an accountant but traded in death. He thought about the soldiers whose lives depended on intelligence remaining secure.

"When do I leave?" he asked.

"Tomorrow. You have a week to establish your cover before the first lecture." Sabine gathered her tablet, preparing to leave. "Your handler in Vienna is already in place. Contact protocols are in the folder. And Max—" She paused at the door. "Roxana Volkov is a civilian. Whatever happens, remember that. She's not the enemy."

The door sealed behind her with a pneumatic hiss, leaving Max alone in the twilight room. He opened the second folder and began reading his new life, committing details to memory with practiced efficiency. But his eyes kept returning to Roxana's photograph, to that expression that suggested she was already searching for something she couldn't name.

In six weeks, he would either save lives or destroy an innocent woman's world.

Possibly both.

**Scene 3: Sabine presents Roxana's comprehensive dossier**

Sabine slid a manila folder across the polished table, followed by a tablet displaying a high-resolution photograph. Max's eyes settled on the image before him.

Roxana Volkova stood in what appeared to be the courtyard of the Belvedere Museum, autumn light catching the copper tones in her dark hair. She wore a charcoal coat, hands tucked into its pockets, her gaze directed at something beyond the frame. There was a stillness to her posture that suggested either profound contemplation or profound loneliness.

"Roxana Mikhailovna Volkova, née Sokolova," Sabine began, her fingers dancing across her own tablet. The wall screen flickered to life with a cascade of images. "Thirty-four years old. Born in Moscow to a family of academics—father was a philosophy professor, mother taught literature. She followed the family tradition."

More photographs appeared. Roxana in a university lecture hall, younger, animated, gesturing toward a projected image of a Renaissance painting. Roxana at a gallery opening, champagne flute in hand, mid-laugh with a group of colleagues. The transformation between those images and the solitary figure in Vienna was striking.

"She was on track for tenure at Moscow State University," Sabine continued. "Published two well-received papers on Italian Baroque art. Specialized in Caravaggio, particularly his use of chiaroscuro—the interplay of light and shadow."

Max leaned back, studying the progression of images. "Let me guess. She met Viktor and threw it all away for love."

"Not quite that simple." Sabine tapped the screen, pulling up what appeared to be surveillance footage from a Moscow café, five years old according to the timestamp. "Viktor was already married when they met. His first wife died in a car accident six months later. He and Roxana were married within the year."

The implication hung in the air like cigarette smoke.

Max picked up the physical file, flipping through pages of surveillance reports. "Convenient timing."

"The accident was investigated. Nothing conclusive." Sabine stood, moving to the window overlooking the Virginia landscape. "What matters is that Roxana gave up everything. Her position, her research, her entire life in Moscow. Viktor's diplomatic career meant constant relocation—Prague, Geneva, now Vienna. Difficult to maintain an academic career when you're moving every eighteen months."

"Does she resent him for it?" Max asked, studying a more recent photograph. Roxana at the Vienna State Opera, seated alone in a red velvet chair during intermission, program folded in her lap.

"That's what you need to find out." Sabine returned to the table, scrolling through more files. "Our psychological profile suggests a woman experiencing significant isolation. She attends cultural events three to four times per week—always alone. Viktor rarely accompanies her. His schedule is consumed by diplomatic functions she's not invited to."

The screen displayed a calendar marked with colored dots. Red for gallery visits. Blue for concerts. Green for lectures at the University of Vienna's art history department, which she audited without enrollment.

"No friends?" Max asked.

"Not in Vienna. She maintains email correspondence with former colleagues in Moscow, but those contacts have diminished over the past year." Sabine pulled up a graph showing communication frequency. The downward trend was unmistakable. "She's a woman adrift, Max. Intelligent, educated, underutilized. The perfect combination of vulnerability and access."

Max studied another photograph—Roxana in a café, laptop open, surrounded by art books. Her expression was absorbed, almost hungry. He recognized that look. He'd seen it in mirrors during his own moments of isolation, those rare instances when the masks came off.

"What does she do all day?" he asked.

"She's writing a book. Or trying to." Sabine brought up intercepted cloud storage documents. "A monograph on Caravaggio's late period. She's been working on it for three years. Progress is slow. We suspect Viktor doesn't take it seriously."

"Does he know about the book?"

"He knows. He's made comments at dinner parties—we have audio—dismissing it as a hobby. Something to keep her occupied." Sabine's tone carried a rare edge of distaste. "He's controlling in subtle ways. Monitors her spending. Questions her whereabouts. Classic patterns of psychological manipulation."

Max set down the file, his fingers drumming once against the table. "You're painting a picture of an unhappy marriage."

"I'm painting a picture of an opportunity." Sabine met his eyes. "Roxana Volkova is isolated, intellectually starved, and trapped in a gilded cage. You're going to offer her something she hasn't had in five years."

"Which is?"

"To be seen." Sabine pulled up a final image—Roxana at a gallery, standing before a Caravaggio painting, her face illuminated by the carefully directed spotlights. The chiaroscuro her specialty demanded. Light and shadow. "Someone who understands her work. Who values her mind. Who makes her feel like the person she used to be."

Max studied the photograph for a long moment. In the play of light across Roxana's features, he saw something that made his jaw tighten almost imperceptibly. Recognition, perhaps. Or warning.

"When do I leave?" he asked.

"Forty-eight hours. We've established your cover as an art consultant based in London, in Vienna to authenticate a private collection. You'll have a gallery opening to attend Thursday evening." Sabine handed him another folder, thicker than the first. "Everything you need to know about Italian Baroque art is in here. I suggest you study it carefully. Roxana will spot a fraud in seconds."

Max took the folder, feeling its weight. Six weeks to become someone else. Six weeks to make a lonely woman trust him. Six weeks to betray that trust for secrets that might prevent a war.

"One more thing," Sabine said as he stood to leave. "Roxana's not just Viktor's wife. According to our sources, she was the one who encouraged him to pursue the diplomatic track in the first place. She may be more complicit than she appears."

Max paused at the door, glancing back at the wall screen where Roxana's image still glowed. The woman in the photograph looked back at him across the distance of surveillance and circumstance, her expression unreadable.

"Or," he said quietly, "she might be exactly what she appears to be. A woman who made a terrible mistake and doesn't know how to escape it."

Sabine's silence was answer enough.

**Scene 4: Sabine outlines the mission timeline and methodology**

Sabine Voss pressed a button on the remote, and the wall screen shifted to display a calendar marked with red X's counting down from forty-two days. The harsh fluorescent lighting of the briefing room cast sharp shadows across her face as she turned to face Max.

"Six weeks," she said, her voice cutting through the recycled air like a blade. "That's all we have. Viktor Volkov's transfer to Beijing is confirmed for November fifteenth. Once he's in China, he'll be untouchable, and whatever intelligence pipeline he's running will go underground."

Max leaned back in his chair, the leather creaking beneath him. He studied the calendar, mentally calculating the margin for error. It was tight—too tight for his liking—but he'd worked with less.

"The timeline's aggressive," he said. "Building trust takes time. If I rush it, she'll sense something's off."

"Which is why we're not leaving the first contact to chance." Sabine clicked the remote again. The screen now displayed a sleek gallery interior, all white walls and track lighting. "The Kunsthalle Wien is hosting a special exhibition next Friday evening—'Echoes of the Soviet Avant-Garde.' Roxana hasn't missed a Russian art exhibition in Vienna in three years. She'll be there."

Max rose from his seat and moved closer to the screen, examining the gallery layout. His reflection ghosted across the projected image—a shadow merging with the pristine exhibition space.

"And my cover?"

Sabine slid a thin folder across the conference table. The sound of paper on polished wood seemed unnaturally loud in the confined space. "Alexander Hartley, independent art dealer specializing in Eastern European acquisitions. We've been building this identity for two months—gallery contacts in London and Prague, a legitimate website, transaction histories, even a few pieces currently on consignment at Sotheby's."

Max opened the folder. Inside were business cards, a passport, credit cards, all bearing his new name. A photograph showed him at what appeared to be an art auction, deep in conversation with a well-dressed woman. He didn't remember the photo being taken—which meant the agency had been planning this longer than Sabine was letting on.

"You've been thorough," he observed, a hint of something unreadable in his tone.

"We always are." Sabine moved to stand beside him, her reflection joining his on the screen. "The gallery owner, Markus Brenner, is an asset. He'll introduce you to Roxana as a favor to an old friend. From there, the connection needs to be organic. You'll express interest in her expertise, perhaps consult her about a piece you're considering for acquisition."

"The Kandinsky in Viktor's file."

"Exactly." A ghost of approval flickered across Sabine's features. "She wrote her dissertation on Kandinsky's Munich period. It's her passion. Use that."

Max turned from the screen, his eyes meeting Sabine's. In the sterile light, he could see the fine lines around her eyes, the tension in her jaw. This mission mattered to her—perhaps more than she was saying.

"What's the secondary objective?" he asked quietly.

Sabine's expression hardened. "There is no secondary objective. Get the documents, get out, maintain plausible deniability for Roxana if possible. Clean and simple."

"Nothing about this is simple." Max closed the folder, his fingers resting on his new identity. "You're asking me to manipulate a woman who's done nothing wrong, to turn her against her husband, potentially destroy her life. All for photographs of documents we're not even certain exist."

"They exist." Sabine's voice dropped to barely above a whisper, but the certainty in it was absolute. "Three NATO officers are dead, Max. Two in accidents that weren't accidents, one from a heart attack at thirty-four with no prior health conditions. Whatever Viktor is selling, people are dying to protect it."

The room seemed to contract around them, the air growing heavier. Max could hear the faint hum of the ventilation system, the distant click of footsteps in the corridor outside. He thought of the woman in the dossier—Roxana, sitting alone at a café, her face turned toward the sunlight streaming through the window. Unaware that her world was about to be carefully, methodically dismantled.

"When do I leave?" he asked.

"Thursday morning. You'll have two days to settle into your cover before the exhibition." Sabine moved to the door, her hand resting on the handle. "Your apartment in Vienna is already prepared, Leopoldstadt district. The address is in your operational packet, along with your contact protocols."

Max gathered the folder, feeling the weight of Alexander Hartley settling onto his shoulders like a familiar coat. "And if six weeks isn't enough?"

Sabine paused, her back to him. When she spoke, her voice carried the weight of decisions made in rooms even more secret than this one.

"Then we move to contingency plans neither of us will enjoy." She opened the door, and the sounds of the building rushed in—voices, computers, the machinery of intelligence gathering. "Don't let it come to that, Max. For everyone's sake."

She left him alone in the briefing room, surrounded by the ghosts of his new identity and the ticking clock on the screen. Forty-two days. Max stood motionless, his mind already in Vienna, already calculating angles and approaches, already becoming someone else.

The fluorescent lights hummed their monotonous song, and somewhere in the building, a phone rang unanswered. Max looked once more at Roxana's photograph on the screen, committing her face to memory—the slight sadness in her smile, the intelligence in her eyes, the loneliness that seemed to emanate from the image itself.

"I'm sorry," he said to the empty room, though he wasn't sure if he was apologizing to Roxana, to himself, or to whoever Alexander Hartley might have been in another life.

Then he turned and walked out, leaving the briefing room behind, carrying nothing but a folder full of lies and six weeks to make them truth.

**Scene 5: Alone in his apartment after the briefing**

The first gray light of dawn filtered through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Max's apartment, casting long shadows across the hardwood floor. He sat at the dining table—a sleek piece of glass and chrome that doubled as his workspace—with Roxana Volkova's dossier spread before him like a dissection.

The apartment reflected the man: minimal, functional, revealing nothing. White walls. Black leather furniture. No photographs, no plants, no evidence that anyone actually lived here. Just a staging ground between assignments, a place to sleep and prepare. The coffee maker hissed in the kitchen, the only sound besides the distant hum of early morning traffic on Connecticut Avenue.

Max picked up one of the surveillance photographs, holding it toward the window. Roxana at a gallery opening in Vienna, three months ago. She stood apart from a cluster of diplomats' wives, her attention fixed on a painting the camera hadn't captured. Her posture was elegant but isolated—shoulders slightly turned away from the crowd, champagne glass held but not sipped. The photographer had caught her in profile: high cheekbones, dark hair swept into a chignon, an expression that seemed far away.

He set it down and picked up another. Roxana leaving the Kunsthistorisches Museum, alone. Another at a café on Graben, reading. Always alone. Always with that same quality of distance, as if she existed in a space slightly removed from the world around her.

*Just another mark*, he told himself, reaching for his coffee. *Another asset to be cultivated.*

But his hand paused over a close-up shot, taken with a telephoto lens. This one was different. She'd been caught unaware, looking up at something—a building, perhaps, or the sky. Her face was unguarded, and in her eyes he saw something that made his chest tighten inexplicably. Not sadness, exactly. Recognition, maybe. The look of someone who understood what it meant to wear a mask.

Max pushed back from the table, crossing to the window. The city was waking up below—joggers on the sidewalk, taxis beginning their morning rounds. Normal people living normal lives. He pressed his palm against the cool glass.

He'd run this play before. Different cities, different names, different faces. Istanbul. Prague. Singapore. The approach was always the same: identify the weakness, exploit the need, establish trust, extract what was required. Clean. Professional. Effective.

So why did his reflection in the window look tired?

He returned to the table, forcing himself to focus on the operational details. Roxana's routine: Tuesday mornings at the Albertina, Thursday evenings at the opera, Sunday afternoons at Café Central. Her vulnerabilities: isolation, intellectual hunger, a marriage that appeared more political arrangement than partnership. Viktor traveled frequently, leaving her alone for days at a time.

The approach vector was clear. Art would be the entry point—his cover as a private acquisitions consultant was already being established. He'd studied enough to be convincing, and Roxana's academic background meant she'd appreciate genuine knowledge. First contact would be accidental, carefully orchestrated to seem like fate.

Max pulled out a yellow legal pad and began sketching the operation timeline. Week one: establish presence, create opportunities for natural encounters. Week two: initial contact, build rapport. Week three: deepen connection, identify emotional leverage points. Week four—

He stopped writing.

The pen hovered over the paper as he stared at Roxana's photograph again. In the harsh morning light, he could see the fine print of her dossier beneath it: *No known political affiliations. No indication of disloyalty to husband. Described by acquaintances as "kind" and "thoughtful."*

Kind. Thoughtful. The words seemed to pulse on the page.

Max set down the pen and rubbed his eyes. He was tired, that was all. The flight from Bogotá had been long, and he hadn't slept properly in three days. This hesitation was just fatigue, the normal human reluctance before stepping into a role that would consume the next six weeks of his life.

He gathered the photographs into a neat stack, slipping them back into the folder. His fingers lingered on the cover, where someone had stamped in red ink: *OPERATION NIGHTFALL - EYES ONLY*.

"It's just a job," he said aloud to the empty apartment. His voice sounded hollow in the minimalist space, absorbed by the bare walls and offering no echo, no confirmation.

He carried the folder to the bedroom and locked it in the safe hidden behind a framed print—an abstract piece he'd chosen because it meant nothing, revealed nothing. As the safe door clicked shut, he caught sight of himself in the mirror above the dresser.

For just a moment, he let himself wonder what Roxana would see when she looked at him. Would she recognize another exile, another person playing a part? Or would she see only what he showed her—the carefully constructed fiction of a man who didn't exist?

Max turned away from his reflection and headed for the shower. He had a flight to Vienna in eight hours, and before that, there were cover documents to review, contact protocols to memorize, a legend to inhabit so completely that he could almost forget who he really was.

Almost.

As the hot water beat against his shoulders, he made himself a promise: this time would be no different than the others. He would do what needed to be done, extract what needed to be extracted, and move on to the next assignment. Roxana Volkova was a means to an end, nothing more.

But even as he repeated this to himself, her eyes from the photograph lingered in his mind—intelligent, sad, searching. The eyes of someone waiting for something she couldn't name.

Max turned the water to cold and let it shock the doubt from his system. By the time he stepped out, his face was composed again, professional. The operative had returned, and the man who'd hesitated at the dining table was locked away as securely as the dossier in the safe.

He had work to do.

## Chapter 2: First Contact

**Scene 1: Max arrives at the Kunsthistor...**

**Scene 1: Max arrives at the Kunsthistorisches Museum**

The afternoon light slanted through the tall windows of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, turning the marble floors to honey. Max Monroe stood in the Maria Theresien-Platz entrance, watching invitation-holders trickle past the velvet ropes into the private exhibition. His charcoal suit was Savile Row, his shoes Italian leather, his watch a vintage Patek Philippe—every detail calibrated to suggest old money and refined taste.

Michael Brennan. American. Boston family. Yale Art History. Specializing in Imperial Russian decorative arts.

He'd been Michael Brennan for three weeks now, building the legend through carefully placed phone calls, a few strategic appearances at Christie's Vienna, and a rented apartment in the First District with the right address. The cover sat on him like a well-tailored coat.

Max presented his invitation—acquired through a contact at Sotheby's—and moved into the exhibition hall. The space was intimate, perhaps fifty guests maximum, their murmured conversations echoing off the vaulted ceilings. Champagne flutes caught the light. The air smelled of expensive perfume and old wood polish.

He'd walked this room twice before during public hours, memorizing sight lines and conversation zones. Now he moved with practiced ease toward the Fabergé collection, positioned in an alcove beneath a painting of Catherine the Great. The centerpiece was the Winter Egg, its surface of carved rock crystal and platinum catching light like frozen water.

Perfect.

Max positioned himself at a forty-five-degree angle to the display case, close enough to seem engaged but not so close as to appear territorial. From here, he could see both entrances. His hand rested casually in his pocket, fingers brushing the business cards embossed with Michael Brennan's details.

A waiter passed with champagne. Max took a glass he wouldn't drink.

He checked his watch—a gesture, nothing more. Roxana Volkov would arrive between four-fifteen and four-thirty. She never missed Russian imperial exhibitions, and she was always fashionably late. The Agency's surveillance had been thorough.

Two women in their sixties examined a jeweled cigarette case nearby, speaking German. A young couple photographed a miniature portrait. Max studied the Winter Egg, letting his eyes trace the delicate platinum branches etched across its surface, the tiny diamonds representing frost. He'd memorized every detail, every date, every provenance note. Michael Brennan would know these things.

The muscles between his shoulder blades held a familiar tension. First contact was always a tightrope—too eager and you spooked them, too aloof and you lost the opportunity. Everything depended on reading the moment, on instinct honed through a dozen operations across a dozen cities.

But Roxana Volkov wasn't a target in the usual sense. She was an access point. A door that needed opening.

Max adjusted his cufflink and waited, his reflection ghosting across the glass case. Behind him, the gallery filled with the soft percussion of footsteps and cultured voices. The light shifted as clouds moved outside.

Four-seventeen.

The main entrance drew his peripheral attention—a small group entering, led by a museum curator in an immaculate suit. And there, just behind him, a woman in a navy dress that whispered money and Moscow in equal measure.

Roxana Volkov.

Max didn't turn. Not yet. He let her move into the space, let her orient herself, let the moment breathe. His heart rate stayed steady, his breathing unchanged. This was just another operation.

He took a small step closer to the Winter Egg, tilting his head as if noticing something new, and waited for the world to shift into motion.

**Scene 2: Roxana enters the gallery, and ...**

**Scene 2: Roxana enters the gallery, and Max observes her from a distance**

The Fabergé exhibition room hummed with the murmur of Vienna's elite, their voices echoing softly against marble floors and vaulted ceilings. Max stood before a display case containing the Azure Serpent Clock, pretending to study its coiled mechanism while his peripheral vision tracked the entrance.

She arrived at precisely 7:47 PM.

Roxana Volkov moved through the arched doorway like a woman accustomed to being watched but indifferent to it. Her black cocktail dress was understated—Dior, Max guessed, maybe Saint Laurent—the kind of expensive simplicity that whispered rather than shouted. Dark hair swept up in a classic chignon. Pearls at her throat. She paused just inside the threshold, her gaze sweeping the room with the practiced efficiency of someone cataloging exits and faces in a single glance.

*FSB training*, Max thought. *Or just the instincts of a woman who's learned to be careful.*

He watched her decline a glass of champagne from a passing waiter with a polite shake of her head. No alcohol. Maintaining control. She moved deeper into the gallery, her heels clicking a measured rhythm against the floor, stopping before a display of miniature Easter eggs. The way she tilted her head, the slight softening of her shoulders—there was something almost wistful in her posture.

Max counted to thirty, then began his approach.

He drifted past two other displays, timing his steps so that he would arrive at the Imperial Coronation Egg precisely fifteen seconds before she did. The egg sat in solitary splendor beneath focused lighting, its gold surface gleaming, the double-headed eagles rendered in exquisite detail. He positioned himself at the optimal angle—close enough to seem absorbed in the piece, far enough to allow her space.

Her reflection appeared in the glass case beside his.

They stood in silence for a moment, two strangers admiring the same object. Max could smell her perfume now—something subtle, expensive. Not the heavy Russian scents popular in Moscow, but something French. Chanel, perhaps.

"Remarkable, isn't it?" Max said, his American accent carefully neutral—educated East Coast with hints of time spent abroad. "The precision of the enamelwork. Wigström was Fabergé's head workmaster when this was created. You can see his signature attention to detail in the gradation of the yellow enamel."

Roxana turned slightly, her dark eyes assessing him with the kind of quick intelligence that made Max's pulse quicken—not from nerves, but from the recognition of a worthy opponent.

"You know your Fabergé, Mr...?" Her English was flawless, touched with a British accent that suggested expensive schools.

"Brennan. Michael Brennan." He extended his hand. "Guilty as charged. Occupational hazard, I'm afraid. I deal in European decorative arts."

Her handshake was firm, brief. "Roxana Volkov."

"A pleasure." Max returned his gaze to the egg, giving her space to decide whether to continue the conversation. "Though I have to admit, I'm partial to the lesser-known pieces. Everyone knows the Coronation Egg, but have you seen the Lilies of the Valley Egg? It's in the far corner. The pearls that form the lily petals—"

"Are each hand-selected for uniform size and luster," Roxana finished, the ghost of a smile touching her lips. "And the miniature portraits of Nicholas II and his daughters are concealed behind the central flower. I've seen photographs, but never the actual piece."

Max smiled, genuinely pleased. "You're not just another champagne-sipping socialite, are you, Mrs. Volkov?"

"Ms. Volkov," she corrected, though without edge. "And no. My grandfather was a curator at the Hermitage. I grew up surrounded by these pieces. Or at least, the ones that survived."

There it was—that note of sadness he'd read about in her file. The weight of history, of things lost. Max filed it away.

"Then you must let me bore you with my amateur observations," he said, gesturing toward the Lilies of the Valley Egg across the room. "Unless you're waiting for someone?"

Roxana glanced at the thin gold watch on her wrist—Cartier, Max noted—then back at him. For a moment, he thought she might decline. Her expression was carefully neutral, the mask of a diplomat's wife firmly in place.

But then something shifted in her eyes. A decision made.

"I'm not waiting for anyone," she said quietly. "And I doubt very much that you could bore me, Mr. Brennan."

They moved together through the gallery, their footsteps falling into an easy rhythm. The crowd parted around them, and Max was acutely aware of the space between them—close enough for conversation, distant enough to remain proper. Professional.

*Just another operation*, he reminded himself.

But as they stopped before the Lilies of the Valley Egg and Roxana leaned forward to examine the delicate pearls, her face illuminated by the display lights, Max felt something he hadn't anticipated.

Interest. Real, unscripted interest.

He pushed the thought aside and launched into his prepared observations about the egg's provenance, his voice warm and engaging, every word calculated to draw her deeper into conversation.

Roxana listened, asked intelligent questions, and when she laughed at his story about a disastrous auction in Geneva, the sound was genuine and unguarded.

The operation was proceeding exactly as planned.

So why did that make him uneasy?

**Scene 3: Their conversation about the F...**

**Scene 3: Their conversation about the Fabergé egg evolves into a deeper discussion**

The gilded halls of the Kunsthistorisches Museum seemed to contract around them as they moved from the Fabergé display into the adjoining gallery. Max found himself genuinely engaged, a dangerous development he noted with professional detachment even as he leaned closer to hear Roxana's observations.

"You see how Fabergé used guilloché here?" She gestured toward a smaller egg in a corner case, her gloved hand hovering near the glass. "The wave pattern beneath the translucent enamel. It's meant to evoke water, memory—things that slip through your fingers."

Max studied her profile in the warm museum lighting. She wore her dark hair swept back in a simple chignon, and her burgundy dress was elegant without being ostentatious. Everything about her presentation was controlled, refined. But there was something in the way she looked at the egg—a hunger, or perhaps a loss.

"You speak as if you've seen these before," he said. "Outside of museums."

A smile flickered across her lips. "My grandmother had a collection. Nothing so grand as these, of course. Smaller pieces. A cigarette case. A frame with the Romanov crest." She paused, and the smile faded. "All gone now. Sold when we left."

"Left Russia?"

"St. Petersburg. I was twelve." She moved to the next case without waiting for him, her heels clicking softly on the marble floor. "Do you know what it's like, Mr. Brennan, to have your entire world reduced to two suitcases?"

Max followed, maintaining the careful distance of a new acquaintance while his mind catalogued every detail. The slight tension in her shoulders. The way she touched her wedding ring—not nervously, but absently, as if checking it was still there. The refined Moscow accent beneath her German.

"I can't imagine," he said truthfully. "Though I suppose we all carry invisible suitcases. Things we can't bear to leave behind, even when we should."

She turned to him then, and her eyes—gray-green in this light—held his for a moment longer than politeness required. "That's rather philosophical for an art dealer."

"Art dealers traffic in memory," Max replied, warming to the role. "Every piece we sell is someone's past being packed away. You learn to recognize the weight of it."

They had entered a gallery of imperial portraits now, massive canvases depicting Catherine the Great, Alexander II, Nicholas and Alexandra in their doomed splendor. A handful of other visitors drifted through the space, but Roxana seemed oblivious to them. She stopped before a portrait of the last Tsarina, her expression unreadable.

"My grandmother used to say that beauty without purpose is just decoration," Roxana said quietly. "She meant the court, the excess. All of it." She gestured at the painting. "And yet, look at the brushwork. The way Serov captured the sadness in her eyes. Even in 1900, before everything fell apart, he saw it. The ending that was coming."

Max moved beside her, close enough now to catch the subtle scent of her perfume—something with jasmine and bergamot. "Do you miss it? Russia?"

"Every day." The admission seemed to surprise her. She glanced at him, then away. "Which is absurd, isn't it? I have a good life here. Vienna is beautiful. My husband is... successful. We have everything we could need."

The pause before "successful" lasted only a heartbeat, but Max caught it. Filed it away.

"And yet?" he prompted gently.

Roxana laughed, but there was no humor in it. "And yet I spend my afternoons talking to strangers in museums about Fabergé eggs and lost grandmothers. You must think me terribly melancholy, Mr. Brennan."

"I think you're honest," Max said. "It's refreshing."

They walked in silence through two more galleries. Max let the quiet settle between them, a technique he'd learned years ago—people filled silence with truth more readily than they answered questions. Roxana paused occasionally before a painting or artifact, but her earlier enthusiasm had dimmed. She seemed suddenly aware of herself, of how much she'd revealed.

At a display of illuminated manuscripts, she finally spoke again. "Do you really visit Café Central regularly?"

"Most afternoons," Max lied smoothly. "The coffee is terrible, but the atmosphere makes up for it."

"I used to go there," she said. "Years ago, when I first came to Vienna. Before..." She trailed off, touching her ring again. "I always thought I'd go back, but somehow I never do."

"You should," Max said. "They still have the same terrible coffee."

This time her laugh was genuine, and it transformed her face. For a moment, the careful mask slipped, and Max saw the woman beneath—younger than her polished exterior suggested, perhaps lonely, certainly isolated in ways that had nothing to do with geography.

"Perhaps I will," she said.

They had circled back to the exhibition's entrance. Through the tall windows, Max could see dusk settling over Vienna, the buildings taking on that particular golden quality of late afternoon. Other visitors were beginning to drift toward the exits.

Roxana checked a delicate watch on her wrist. "I should go. My driver will be waiting."

"Of course." Max extended his hand. "It was a pleasure, Mrs. Volkov. Truly."

She took his hand, her grip surprisingly firm. "Roxana, please. And yes, it was." She hesitated, and Max recognized the moment—the decision point, the instant when a target either committed or withdrew. "The opera season opens next week. Die Fledermaus. Do you attend?"

"I have tickets for Friday's performance," Max said. Another lie, though he'd acquire them within the hour.

"We have a box," Roxana said. "Fifth tier, center. Perhaps I'll see you there."

"Perhaps you will."

She held his gaze a moment longer, then released his hand and turned toward the exit. Max watched her go, noting the straightness of her spine, the controlled elegance of her movements. At the doorway, she glanced back once, and something in that look—vulnerable, hopeful, already regretting her openness—made his chest tighten.

He waited until she disappeared before pulling out his phone. The message to his handler was brief: *First contact successful. Subject responsive. Proceeding to phase two.*

But as he walked out into the cooling Vienna evening, Max couldn't shake the memory of her voice saying *Do you know what it's like to have your entire world reduced to two suitcases?* 

He did know. He'd done it to people. Helped orchestrate the reduction of entire lives into rubble and ash.

He reminded himself that this was different. This was necessary.

The lie felt thinner than usual.

**Scene 4: As they view a painting of the...**

**Scene 4: As they view a painting of the Russian countryside**

The painting dominated the north wall of the gallery—a vast canvas depicting the endless steppes of southern Russia at twilight. Pale gold light stretched across snow-dusted fields toward a horizon that seemed to exist beyond the frame itself. A single birch tree stood sentinel in the foreground, its white bark luminous against the gathering dusk.

Roxana stopped walking.

Max watched her profile as she studied the landscape, noting how her breathing had changed, becoming slower, deeper. The museum's climate control hummed softly overhead, maintaining the precise temperature required for preserving centuries-old pigments. Somewhere in an adjacent gallery, footsteps echoed and faded.

"Levitan," she said quietly. "Isaac Levitan. 1895."

"You know it?"

"I know the feeling." Her gloved hand rose slightly, as if she might touch the canvas, then fell back to her side. "That particular quality of light. The way the snow catches the last sun before night comes. You can almost feel the cold."

Max moved closer to the painting, maintaining the careful distance he'd established—near enough to be companionable, far enough to remain unthreatening. The oil paint had been applied in thin layers, building depth through transparency. He could see why the artist had been celebrated.

"It's beautiful," he offered.

"It's lonely." Roxana's voice had changed, losing some of its polished veneer. "All that space. All that silence. When I was a girl, my grandmother had a dacha outside Moscow. In winter, the fields looked exactly like this. Endless. Empty."

She blinked, and the moment passed. The mask slipped back into place—the composed diplomat's wife, the elegant expatriate. But Max had seen beneath it, and he knew she was aware he'd seen.

"I'm sorry," she said, managing a small smile. "I don't usually become maudlin in museums."

"Don't apologize. That's what art is supposed to do, isn't it? Make us feel something real."

Roxana turned from the painting, her heels clicking softly on the polished floor as she moved toward the next gallery. Max fell into step beside her, letting a beat of silence establish itself before speaking again.

"You know, if you enjoy this kind of thing, you should try the Staatsoper sometime. They're doing *Eugene Onegin* next month." He kept his tone casual, conversational. "Tchaikovsky's Russia might be more dramatic than Levitan's, but there's the same kind of... melancholy underneath."

"You like opera?" There was genuine interest in her voice.

"When I can. It's one of the reasons I love Vienna—you can actually afford to go regularly without mortgaging your future." He smiled. "Back in New York, decent seats cost what I'd normally spend on groceries for a month."

"And do you go alone?"

The question hung between them, delicate as the Fabergé egg they'd discussed earlier. Max recognized it for what it was—an inquiry about his availability, his attachments, his accessibility.

"Usually," he said. "I find I notice more when I'm not trying to share the experience. Selfish, maybe, but honest."

They passed through an archway into a smaller gallery, this one displaying Orthodox icons. Gold leaf caught the carefully positioned lighting, creating halos within halos.

"I haven't been to the opera since we arrived in Vienna," Roxana said. "Dmitri finds it boring. He prefers..." She paused, seeming to choose her words carefully. "More modern entertainment."

"His loss." Max stopped before an icon of Saint Nicholas, studying the severe Byzantine features. "Though I suppose opera isn't for everyone. I'm probably too much of a romantic. I even have a regular table at Café Central—same time every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon. Read the paper, watch the world go by. Terribly predictable."

"That doesn't sound predictable. It sounds civilized."

"In this city, maybe they're the same thing." He glanced at his watch—a calculated gesture, suggesting time constraints, preventing the conversation from extending too long. "I should probably let you get back to the exhibition. I've monopolized enough of your afternoon."

"You haven't monopolized anything." Roxana's hand touched his arm briefly, a fleeting contact through the layers of fabric. "This has been the most pleasant conversation I've had in weeks. Thank you, Mr. Brennan."

"Michael, please. And the pleasure was entirely mine."

They exchanged the polite formalities of parting—the subtle dance of two people acknowledging mutual interest while maintaining plausible deniability. As Max walked toward the museum's exit, he resisted the urge to look back. He knew Roxana was watching him leave.

Outside, the afternoon had turned colder. Clouds had moved in from the west, threatening snow. Max turned up his collar and descended the museum steps, mentally reviewing the encounter, cataloging every word, every gesture, every micro-expression.

He'd planted the seeds. Staatsoper. Café Central. Tuesday and Thursday afternoons.

Now he just had to wait for them to grow.

But as he walked through the darkening streets toward his safe house, Max couldn't quite shake the image of Roxana's face as she'd studied that painting—the loneliness in her eyes, the longing for something she'd lost or never had. It had been real. Unguarded. Human.

He told himself it didn't matter. Told himself he'd seen it because he'd been trained to look for exactly those kinds of vulnerabilities.

He almost believed it.

**Scene 5: Viktor Volkov's security detai...**

**Scene 5: Viktor Volkov's security detail appears**

The change in Roxana was instantaneous.

Max saw it happen—the way her shoulders stiffened mid-sentence, her gaze cutting past him toward the gallery entrance. The animated warmth that had colored her face for the past forty minutes drained away, replaced by something carefully neutral.

He followed her line of sight and spotted them immediately: two men in dark suits, their builds suggesting hours in the gym rather than museums. They stood just inside the doorway, hands clasped in front of them, scanning the room with the methodical precision of trained security personnel. The taller one spoke quietly into his sleeve.

"I'm afraid I need to go," Roxana said, her voice suddenly formal, distant.

The transformation was remarkable. The woman who moments ago had been laughing at his story about a disastrous auction in Prague—leaning close, eyes bright with genuine amusement—had vanished. In her place stood the diplomat's wife, poised and impenetrable.

"Of course," Max said smoothly, though he let a hint of disappointment color his tone. "I've monopolized far too much of your time already."

"No, you haven't." The words came quickly, almost urgently, before she caught herself. Her fingers tightened around the small clutch she carried. "I mean—the conversation has been lovely. Truly."

The taller security man was moving toward them now, weaving between clusters of well-dressed patrons admiring Catherine the Great's jeweled snuffboxes. His eyes never left Roxana.

She noticed too. Max watched her take a small breath, squaring her shoulders as if preparing for something unpleasant. The gesture was so subtle he might have missed it if he hadn't been trained to read such tells.

"Mrs. Volkov," the security man said in Russian-accented English. "The car is ready."

"Thank you, Dmitri. I'll be just a moment."

The man didn't move. He stood there, solid as a monument, his presence a clear message: *time's up*.

Roxana turned back to Max, and for just a second, her mask slipped. He saw it again—that sadness he'd glimpsed earlier, deeper now, tinged with something that looked like resignation.

"It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Brennan." She extended her hand.

Max took it, noting the coolness of her skin, the way her grip was firm but brief. Professional. "The pleasure was entirely mine. Perhaps we'll run into each other again. Vienna is a small city in some ways."

"Perhaps." She hesitated, and Max recognized the war playing out behind her eyes. Want versus obligation. Freedom versus control. "You mentioned you frequent Café Central?"

"Almost daily. I find the atmosphere conducive to contemplation." He smiled. "And the apple strudel is exceptional."

"I've heard that." Another pause. The security man shifted his weight, a subtle prompt. "I sometimes walk past there. On Herrengasse."

It was the smallest of invitations, carefully worded, plausibly deniable. Max felt a flicker of something unexpected—not triumph at the successful manipulation, but something uncomfortably close to guilt.

"Then I hope our paths cross again," he said.

Roxana nodded once, then turned toward the exit. Dmitri fell into step beside her, joined by his partner. Max watched them move through the gallery, noting how the security detail positioned themselves—one slightly ahead, one behind, boxing her in without appearing to.

At the doorway, Roxana paused. She glanced back, her eyes finding his across the room.

The look lasted only a heartbeat, but Max felt its weight. There was longing in it, and loneliness, and something else he couldn't quite name. Then she was gone, disappearing into the museum's grand hallway, her footsteps echoing on marble.

Max remained where he was, standing before the Fabergé egg they'd been discussing—an exquisite creation of gold and enamel, beautiful and hollow. Through the arched doorway, he could hear the security team's radio chatter, low and efficient.

He pulled out his phone, pretending to check messages, while his mind catalogued every detail of the past hour. The operation was proceeding exactly as planned. Roxana had taken the bait. The seed was planted.

So why did he feel like he'd just done something he couldn't take back?

Through the tall windows, he caught a glimpse of a black Mercedes pulling away from the museum entrance, its windows tinted dark. He imagined Roxana inside, returning to whatever gilded cage awaited her in the diplomatic quarter.

Max pocketed his phone and turned back to the exhibition, but the art held no interest now. The gallery felt emptier than it had before, despite the other patrons milling about.

He needed to report in. Langley would want to know the first contact was successful.

But first, he needed a drink.

**Scene 6: Alone in the museum after Elen...**

**Scene 6: Alone in the museum after Roxana departs**

Max stood motionless in the Imperial Gallery, listening to Roxana's footsteps fade into the museum's marble silence. The click of her heels echoed through the vaulted spaces, each sound growing fainter until it was swallowed entirely by the weight of centuries-old art surrounding him.

He exhaled slowly, only then realizing he'd been holding his breath.

The Fabergé egg gleamed under its spotlight, its golden surface catching the light in ways that seemed almost alive. Max approached it again, studying the intricate enamel work—the same craftsmanship he'd discussed with Roxana moments ago. His reflection ghosted across the protective glass, distorted and unfamiliar.

*Michael Brennan*. The name sat uncomfortably in his mouth now that she was gone.

He pulled out his phone, typing a brief message to Langley: *First contact established. Target receptive. Proceeding to phase two.*

Professional. Clinical. Exactly as it should be.

Max pocketed the phone and walked toward the windows overlooking the Ringstrasse. Late afternoon sun slanted through the glass, painting golden rectangles across the parquet floor. Outside, Vienna moved with its usual unhurried elegance—trams gliding past, pedestrians strolling beneath the bare trees of late autumn.

Somewhere out there, Roxana was climbing into a car. Returning to Volkov's world of armed drivers and encrypted phones and secrets that could reshape the global order.

And she'd smiled at him. Really smiled—not the practiced curve of lips that diplomats and spies deployed like weapons, but something genuine. When he'd made that joke about American tourists photographing their lunch, her laugh had been spontaneous, unguarded. For just a moment, the careful mask had slipped.

Max pressed his palm against the cool window glass.

This was textbook so far. He'd established the cover identity, created common ground, planted the seeds for future "accidental" encounters. Opera at the Staatsoper. Morning coffee at Café Central. He'd given her breadcrumbs, and she'd picked them up eagerly—perhaps too eagerly.

That loneliness in her eyes. He hadn't expected it to be so naked, so raw.

*She's the target*, he reminded himself. *Volkov's mistress. Your access point to one of the most dangerous men in the intelligence world.*

But his hand was trembling slightly against the glass.

Max had run dozens of operations. He'd seduced assets in Moscow, Beirut, Shanghai—places where betrayal was currency and trust was a weapon. He knew how to read people, how to find the pressure points in their armor and exploit them with surgical precision. He'd broken hardened operatives and turned ideological zealots. He'd done things that kept him awake at night, staring at hotel room ceilings in cities whose names he couldn't remember.

This should be no different.

He turned back to the gallery, his footsteps loud in the emptiness. The imperial portraits watched him with their painted eyes—czars and czarinas frozen in oil and canvas, their empires long turned to dust. They'd played their games of power and intrigue too, he supposed. They'd used people, discarded them, sacrificed them on the altar of ambition.

How many of them had hesitated?

Max stopped in front of a portrait of Catherine the Great. She stared back at him with knowing eyes, as if she could see through the centuries into this moment, into him.

"You'd tell me to do whatever it takes," he muttered to the painting. "Wouldn't you?"

The silence offered no absolution.

He thought about the way Roxana had touched the display case when discussing the Fabergé egg, her fingers hovering just above the glass as if she could feel the history radiating from within. The way she'd tilted her head when listening to him, really listening, as if his words mattered. The subtle catch in her voice when she'd mentioned that beautiful things often carried hidden sorrows.

*She was talking about herself.*

Max's jaw tightened. He was already analyzing her, cataloging her vulnerabilities, building the psychological profile that would let him manipulate her with maximum efficiency. It was automatic now, instinctive—the predator sizing up prey.

Except she hadn't felt like prey.

She'd felt like someone he might have wanted to know, in another life. In a world where he wasn't Max Monroe and she wasn't Dmitri Volkov's mistress and they were just two people who'd met in a museum and talked about art.

"Christ," he whispered, running a hand through his hair.

He pulled out his phone again, staring at the message he'd sent to Langley. Three sentences. Thirty-seven years of training and experience reduced to bureaucratic shorthand.

His thumb hovered over the screen, but he didn't type anything else. What would he say? *Target displays exploitable emotional vulnerability*? *Subject appears isolated within Volkov's circle*? *Asset recruitment probability high*?

Or the truth: *I liked her.*

Max shoved the phone away and strode toward the exit, his footsteps sharp and decisive. The museum guard nodded at him as he passed, and Max returned the gesture, Michael Brennan's easy American smile sliding effortlessly into place.

Outside, the Vienna cold hit him like a slap. He welcomed it, the sharp air clearing his head. A tram rumbled past, and he watched it disappear around the corner, carrying its cargo of ordinary people living ordinary lives.

He'd see Roxana again. At the opera, probably, or at Café Central. He'd deepen the connection, gain her trust, make her believe that Michael Brennan understood her in ways that Volkov never could. He'd offer her glimpses of freedom, of a life beyond gilded cages and dangerous men. And when the moment was right, when she was vulnerable enough and desperate enough, he'd ask her to betray the man she slept beside.

It was the job. It was what he did.

Max turned up his collar against the wind and started walking, no particular destination in mind. His reflection tracked him in the shop windows he passed—a man in an expensive coat, successful and confident, exactly what he appeared to be.

But inside, in the places he'd learned to lock away during operations, something had shifted. A hairline fracture in the armor he'd spent decades perfecting.

He told himself it didn't matter. He told himself it was just first-contact adrenaline, the natural high of a successful deployment. By tomorrow, it would fade. By next week, Roxana would be just another file, another operation, another necessary deception in service of the greater good.

He told himself all of this as he walked through the darkening streets of Vienna, and he almost believed it.

Almost.

# Chapter 3: The Seduction Begins

**Scene 1: Max orchestrates another "chance encounter" with Roxana at Café Central**

The morning light filtered through Café Central's arched windows, casting geometric patterns across the marble tables. Max had been sitting in his usual corner for twenty minutes, a copy of *Der Standard* spread before him like camouflage, when Roxana finally appeared in the doorway.

She wore a cream-colored coat that caught the autumn sun, her dark hair pulled back in a simple knot. Max watched her scan the café's ornate interior, that same slight hesitation in her posture he'd noticed before—as if she were perpetually unsure whether she belonged in the spaces she occupied.

He waited. Timing was everything.

Roxana chose a table near the window, ordered coffee from the waiter, and withdrew a slim volume from her bag. Max gave her five minutes to settle, then folded his newspaper with deliberate precision and stood, angling his path past her table.

"Mrs. Volkov." He let surprise color his voice. "What a pleasant coincidence."

She looked up, and something flickered across her face—pleasure, he thought, quickly suppressed. "Mr. Monroe. You seem to haunt this place."

"Guilty as charged. The coffee's terrible, but the atmosphere makes up for it." He gestured to the empty chair across from her. "May I?"

A pause. Then: "Please."

Max sat, noting the book in her hands. The cover was worn, the spine creased from repeated readings. *Anna Akhmatova: Selected Poems.* In Russian.

"You're reading Akhmatova," he said. "In the original."

Roxana's fingers tightened almost imperceptibly on the book's edges. "You recognize the Cyrillic."

"I recognize the poet. 'I taught myself to live simply and wisely, to look at the sky and pray to God.'" Max quoted the line in English, watching her reaction. "Though I confess, my Russian is limited to the classics. I read her in translation."

"The translations never quite capture her voice." Roxana set the book down, her hand resting protectively over it. "The way she could make grief sound like music."

"She wrote through Stalin's terror. Lost everyone she loved." Max leaned back as the waiter arrived with Roxana's coffee—a melange, he noticed, not the espresso Viktor preferred. "That kind of suffering either destroys you or makes you incandescent. She chose incandescence."

Roxana studied him over the rim of her cup, steam rising between them. "Most people in Vienna prefer their poetry more... comfortable. Rilke. Goethe."

"Most people in Vienna prefer not to think too deeply about anything that might disturb their coffee and pastries."

A smile ghosted across her lips. "You don't like Vienna."

"I didn't say that. I like Vienna very much. But I prefer it when I find someone willing to look beneath the pretty surface." He paused. "The city's built on layers of history it would rather forget. The Habsburgs, the Nazis, the Cold War. All that baroque architecture is just elaborate decoration over the cracks."

"And you think I look beneath surfaces?" Roxana's tone was light, but her eyes were sharp.

"I think you're reading Akhmatova alone in a café on a Thursday morning instead of shopping on the Kärntner Straße. That suggests someone interested in substance over decoration."

She laughed—a genuine sound that transformed her face. "You've made quite a study of me from two brief encounters."

"I'm a journalist. Observation is my profession." Max allowed himself a self-deprecating smile. "Also, I find you interesting. I hope that's not too forward."

The waiter materialized with Max's usual order—schwarzer and a slice of Sachertorte—without being asked. Roxana noticed.

"You really do haunt this place," she said.

"Creatures of habit. We all have our rituals." Max cut into the chocolate cake. "What's yours? Akhmatova on Thursdays?"

"Akhmatova when I need reminding that survival can be its own form of art." Roxana's voice had gone quieter. She seemed surprised by her own candor, her fingers moving to the delicate chain at her throat. "That probably sounds melodramatic."

"It sounds honest." Max held her gaze. "Honesty is rarely melodramatic. It's just uncomfortable for people who prefer polite fictions."

Outside, a tram clattered past, its bell cutting through the café's murmur of conversation and clinking porcelain. Roxana turned toward the window, her profile etched against the light. Max catalogued the details—the tension in her jaw, the way she worried the chain between her fingers, the slight shadows beneath her eyes that makeup couldn't quite conceal.

"There's a line I keep returning to," she said, still looking out the window. "'You will hear thunder and remember me, and think: she wanted storms.' Do you know it?"

"I do."

"I wonder if Akhmatova really wanted storms, or if she just accepted that storms were inevitable." Roxana turned back to him. "There's a difference between desiring chaos and simply refusing to hide from it."

Max felt something shift in his chest—a recognition he hadn't anticipated. This wasn't the bored trophy wife he'd expected to manipulate. Roxana Volkov was drowning in plain sight, and she knew it.

"Maybe the wanting and the accepting are the same thing," he said carefully. "Maybe choosing not to hide is itself a form of desire."

Their eyes met and held. The café noise seemed to recede—the hiss of the espresso machine, the rustle of newspapers, the low conversations in German and English and a dozen other languages. For a moment, there was only the two of them and the dangerous current running between them.

Roxana broke the spell first, glancing at her watch. "I should go. Viktor expects me for lunch."

"Of course." Max stood when she did, the gesture automatic. "Will you be here again? Same time next week?"

She gathered her book and bag, hesitating. "I'm usually here Tuesdays and Thursdays. When I can."

"Then perhaps I'll see you Tuesday." He kept his voice casual, giving her the illusion of choice.

"Perhaps." Roxana smiled—tentative, but real. "Thank you for the conversation, Mr. Monroe. It was... refreshing."

"Max. Please."

"Max." She tested the name, then nodded. "Roxana."

He watched her leave, the cream coat disappearing into the Vienna morning. Only when she was gone did he allow himself to exhale, to acknowledge the way his pulse had quickened during those last moments.

*Careful,* he thought. *This is a job. She's a means to an end.*

But as he returned to his cold coffee and untouched cake, Max found himself already anticipating Tuesday. Already planning what he would say, how he would draw her further in.

The book of poetry lay forgotten on her table. Max signaled the waiter, retrieved it, and slipped it into his jacket pocket. She would need an excuse to see him again.

He was simply providing one.

# Chapter 3: The Seduction Begins

**Scene 2: Over the course of a week, Max...**

The gravel crunched beneath their feet as they walked the serpentine paths of Schönbrunn Gardens. It was Tuesday afternoon, three days after their coffee at Café Central, and the autumn sun filtered through the copper-colored leaves overhead.

"Viktor proposed to me here," Roxana said, gesturing toward the Neptune Fountain ahead. "Right there, actually. Very grand. Very public."

Max noted the flatness in her voice. "You don't sound thrilled about the memory."

"I was thrilled at the time." She pulled her cashmere coat tighter. "Twenty-three years old, swept off my feet by this powerful, confident man. I thought I was the luckiest woman in Vienna."

"And now?"

Roxana stopped walking, turning to face the baroque palace in the distance. "Now I understand the difference between being admired and being seen."

Max let the silence settle between them, a technique he'd perfected over years of extracting information. People rushed to fill silence, especially when they were lonely.

"He collects things," she continued. "Art, properties, influence. I'm just another acquisition. Beautiful enough to display at embassy functions, educated enough not to embarrass him, but not so independent that I'd challenge his authority."

"Why stay?"

She laughed, but there was no humor in it. "You've never been married to a Russian diplomat, have you, Alexander?"

The false name still felt strange on his ears, but he'd trained himself not to react. "Can't say I have."

"Divorce isn't really an option in Viktor's world. It would be... complicated."

They resumed walking, and Max filed away every word, every inflection. This was exactly what he needed—her dissatisfaction, her isolation. But something twisted in his chest at the genuine sadness in her eyes.

---

Thursday brought rain, so they met at the Belvedere Museum instead. Max had suggested it casually during their walk, mentioning his interest in Klimt. Another carefully researched detail—Roxana's master's thesis had focused on Vienna Secession art.

They stood before "The Kiss," surrounded by tourists with cameras and audio guides, but Roxana seemed oblivious to the crowd.

"People think it's romantic," she said, studying the gold-leafed lovers. "But look at the woman's feet. She's at the edge of a cliff, covered in flowers. Beautiful, but one wrong step..."

"And she falls," Max finished.

"Exactly." She glanced at him, and he saw something shift in her expression—recognition, perhaps, of a kindred spirit. "You understand art."

"I understand that nothing is ever just what it appears to be." He moved closer, lowering his voice as if sharing a secret. "Every painting tells two stories—the one the artist intended, and the one the viewer needs to see."

Roxana tilted her head, considering him. "Which story do you see?"

"A woman who's given herself completely to someone who might not deserve her."

The words hung between them, and Max knew they weren't really talking about Klimt anymore. Roxana's breath caught slightly, and she turned back to the painting.

"Tell me about your work," she said, changing the subject but not moving away. "You said you consult on art acquisitions?"

This was the moment he'd been building toward—the chance to cement his cover. "Mostly for private collectors. I help them find pieces that match their vision, authenticate provenance, negotiate with dealers. It's why I travel so much."

"Lonely work."

"Sometimes." He let his shoulder brush against hers, testing boundaries. She didn't pull away. "But it has its moments."

They moved through the museum slowly, and Max wove his fabricated life with practiced ease. A childhood in London (true), university at Cambridge (false—it was actually Oxford, but Roxana might know people at Oxford), a brief marriage that ended amicably (complete fiction). He peppered the lies with enough genuine details to make them believable—his mother's love of Handel, his father's disappointing career as a banker, his own restlessness that drove him into work where he could move freely.

"No family now?" Roxana asked as they examined a Schiele.

"My mother passed five years ago. Father before that. No siblings." All true, which made it easier to sell. "You?"

"A sister in Moscow. We're not close." She paused. "Viktor doesn't approve of her husband. Wrong political connections."

Another crack in the facade, another piece of leverage. Max filed it away.

---

Saturday afternoon found them at a small café in the Seventh District, far from the tourist routes and farther still from the diplomatic circles where Roxana might be recognized. Max had chosen it deliberately—intimate, quiet, with small tables that necessitated leaning close to hear each other.

Roxana arrived fifteen minutes late, slightly breathless, a silk scarf protecting her hair from the drizzle outside.

"I'm sorry," she said, sliding into the chair across from him. "I had to wait for Viktor to leave for his meeting."

The admission hung between them—that she was hiding these meetings, that they'd crossed from coincidental to intentional.

"Should I be worried?" Max asked, keeping his tone light. "Will I find myself in the Danube wearing concrete shoes?"

"Viktor's not the mafia." But she didn't quite meet his eyes. "He's just... traditional. He wouldn't understand a friendship with a man."

"Is that what this is? Friendship?"

Roxana's fingers traced the rim of her coffee cup. "I don't know what this is."

Neither did Max, and that was the problem. He was supposed to be in control, carefully orchestrating each interaction, but something about Roxana's intelligence, her wry observations, the way she really listened when he spoke—it was getting under his skin.

She'd spent the last twenty minutes dissecting the latest political scandal in Austria's parliament with the kind of sharp analysis that would have impressed his handlers at Langley. She'd made him laugh twice with perfectly timed quips about the pretensions of Vienna's art world. And when she'd mentioned, almost casually, that Viktor would be in Budapest next Thursday for three days, Max had felt something beyond professional satisfaction at the intelligence.

"Tell me something true," Roxana said suddenly, her dark eyes fixed on his. "Not about art or work. Something real."

Max's training screamed at him to deflect, to offer another carefully crafted piece of his cover story. But he found himself saying, "I'm tired of being alone."

It was true, he realized with uncomfortable clarity. Years of operations, of temporary identities and disposable relationships, had left him hollowed out. He'd forgotten what it felt like to talk to someone without calculating every word.

Roxana reached across the table, her fingers brushing his wrist. "Me too."

The touch lasted only a second, but Max felt it like an electric current. This was dangerous. This was exactly what he shouldn't be feeling.

"I should go," Roxana said, but she didn't move. "Viktor will be home by six."

"Thursday," Max said. "When he's in Budapest. Have dinner with me."

"Alexander..."

"Just dinner. Somewhere we can actually talk without watching the clock."

She hesitated, and Max could see the war playing out behind her eyes—duty versus desire, safety versus risk. He knew which side would win. He'd orchestrated it that way.

"Okay," she whispered. "Thursday."

As she left, disappearing into the Vienna drizzle, Max sat back and took a long breath. He should have felt triumphant—the hook was set, the operation progressing exactly as planned. Instead, he felt the first stirrings of something he hadn't experienced in years.

Guilt.

He pulled out his phone and typed a brief message to his handler: *Target engaged. Proceeding to next phase.*

The words looked clinical on the screen, professional. They didn't capture the warmth of Roxana's laugh or the loneliness in her eyes or the way his chest had tightened when she'd touched his wrist.

Max deleted the message and tried again: *Relationship developing. Will have extended access Thursday.*

Better. More detached.

He sent it and ordered another coffee, watching the rain streak down the café window. Seven more days until Thursday. Seven more days to remember that Roxana Volkov wasn't a lonely woman trapped in a loveless marriage—she was an asset, a means to an end, a way to get to Viktor and the intelligence he possessed.

Seven days to convince himself that the flutter he'd felt when she smiled at him was just good tradecraft.

He had a feeling seven days wouldn't be enough.

**Scene 3: During an afternoon walk, Elen...**

**Scene 3: During an afternoon walk, Roxana reveals more about her marriage to Viktor**

The Stadtpark wore autumn like a borrowed coat—golden leaves scattered across pathways, the air crisp with the promise of winter. Max walked beside Roxana along a quiet path that curved away from the main promenade, where the sounds of the city faded to a distant hum. Overhead, clouds the color of pewter threatened rain.

Roxana had been silent for the past five minutes, her heels clicking against the cobblestones in a steady rhythm. She'd suggested this walk after their coffee at Café Central, claiming she needed air. Now she walked with her arms wrapped around herself despite the cashmere coat that probably cost more than most people's monthly salary.

"Do you know what Viktor said to me on our wedding night?" Her voice cut through the quiet, startling a pair of pigeons from their perch.

Max glanced at her profile. "What?"

"He said, 'You'll be perfect for the embassy circuit. They'll love you in Vienna.'" She laughed, but there was no humor in it. "Not 'I love you.' Not even 'You look beautiful.' Just... an assessment of my utility."

They reached a small bridge spanning an ornamental pond. Roxana stopped, gripping the iron railing with gloved hands. Below, the water reflected the grey sky, dark and still.

"I was twenty-three," she continued, staring down at the water. "Fresh out of university, working at a gallery in Moscow. He came to an exhibition—Kandinsky, I remember—and he stood in front of this one painting for twenty minutes. I thought, here's a man who understands art. Who feels deeply."

Max moved closer, close enough to smell her perfume—something subtle, expensive. Jasmine and bergamot. "And he didn't?"

"He was calculating its value." Roxana's knuckles whitened on the railing. "Later, I learned he bought it. Not because it moved him, but because owning a Kandinsky meant something. Status. Prestige." She turned to face him, and her eyes were bright with unshed tears. "That's what I am, Max. Another acquisition. Beautiful enough to display at dinner parties, connected enough through my father to be useful, educated enough to make intelligent conversation when required."

A leaf drifted down between them, landing on the bridge's stone surface. Max watched it skitter away in the breeze, buying himself a moment. He should be cataloging this—*marriage strained, emotionally vulnerable, father's connections mentioned*—but instead he felt a tightness in his chest that had nothing to do with the mission.

"Why did you marry him?" The question came out softer than he intended.

Roxana's smile was bitter. "My father approved. Viktor was rising in the diplomatic corps, ambitious, from a good family. And I..." She paused, looking away. "I thought love would come. That if I was patient, if I was good enough, he would eventually see me as more than just... an ornament."

"And it didn't."

"No." The word hung in the air between them. "He has rules, you know. About what I wear to official functions. Who I can befriend. Where I can go without him." She laughed again, that hollow sound. "I'm not allowed to work. He says it's beneath the wife of a deputy ambassador. So I sit in our beautiful apartment with its beautiful things, and I arrange flowers, and I wait for him to come home from meetings with people who actually matter."

Max leaned against the railing beside her, their shoulders almost touching. "Is that why you keep meeting me? A small rebellion?"

She turned to look at him, really look at him, and the vulnerability in her expression made something twist in his gut. "Maybe at first. But now..." She trailed off, shaking her head. "You actually listen when I talk. You ask questions about what I think, not just what Viktor thinks. Do you know how rare that is?"

*Dangerous*, Max thought. *This is getting dangerous*. He could feel himself slipping, the careful distance between operative and target beginning to blur. Roxana wasn't supposed to be real—she was supposed to be a means to an end, a chess piece in a larger game.

But standing here in the fading afternoon light, watching her fight back tears as she described her gilded cage, she was achingly, devastatingly real.

"Roxana—"

"Don't," she said quickly. "Don't tell me it will get better, or that I should try harder, or any of the things everyone else says." She wiped at her eyes with one gloved hand. "Just... let me be honest with someone. Please."

The rain started then, light drops that darkened the stones around them. Roxana tilted her face up to the sky, letting the water touch her skin. When she looked back at Max, something had shifted in her expression—a decision made, a line crossed.

"Walk me back?" she asked. "I should go before Viktor notices how long I've been gone."

They walked in silence, the rain growing steadier, droplets catching in Roxana's dark hair like diamonds. Max's mind raced, analyzing, calculating. She was isolated, unhappy, controlled—exactly the psychological profile they'd hoped for. Every word she'd spoken was ammunition, leverage, a crack in Viktor Volkov's carefully constructed life.

But his hand, when it brushed against hers as they walked, trembled slightly.

At the park's edge, where a taxi waited, Roxana turned to him. Rain streaked her face, and he couldn't tell if she was crying.

"Same time Thursday?" she asked. "There's an exhibition at the Belvedere I'd like to see."

"I'll be there."

She smiled—genuine this time, warm despite the cold rain—and climbed into the taxi. Max watched it pull away, merging into Vienna's evening traffic.

He stood there for a long moment, rain soaking through his jacket, trying to remember why he was doing this. The mission. The intelligence. The greater good.

But all he could think about was the catch in Roxana's voice when she'd called herself an ornament, and the way his chest had tightened in response—a feeling that had nothing to do with tradecraft and everything to do with something far more complicated.

*Thursday*, he thought, turning up his collar against the rain. *The Belvedere*.

He was already looking forward to it, and that was the most dangerous thing of all.

**Scene 4: Max meets with his handler, Sa...**

**Scene 4: Max meets with his handler, Sabine, at a secure location**

The safe house smelled of dust and old radiators, a third-floor walk-up in Vienna's 7th district that hadn't been updated since the Cold War. Max climbed the narrow stairs, checking the chalk mark on the bannister—unchanged, meaning no one had entered since Sabine's last sweep. The floorboards creaked under his weight as he reached the landing.

Sabine was already inside, silhouetted against the single window overlooking Neubaugasse. She didn't turn when he entered, just continued watching the street below through a gap in the yellowed curtains. The room contained only the essentials: a scarred wooden table, two mismatched chairs, and a portable signal jammer humming quietly in the corner.

"You're late," she said.

"Traffic." Max locked the door behind him, engaging both deadbolts. "The U-Bahn was delayed."

"You should have taken a taxi. Different route each time." Now she turned, and Max saw the tension in her jaw. Sabine Voss was forty-two, compact and precise, with iron-gray streaks in her black hair that she'd earned during fifteen years running operations across three continents. She wore her usual uniform—dark jeans, leather jacket, no jewelry. Nothing memorable.

"A taxi creates a paper trail," Max countered, dropping into one of the chairs. It wobbled under him.

"So does your credit card at Café Central. Three times in one week, Max. Same table, same time of day." She pulled a manila folder from her messenger bag and slid it across the table. "You're establishing patterns. That's sloppy."

Max opened the folder. Surveillance photos, time-stamped and annotated. Him and Roxana at the café. Walking through Schönbrunn Gardens. Entering Restaurant Steirereck last Thursday. The images were crisp, professional—their own people documenting his movements.

"I'm building a relationship," he said evenly. "That requires consistency."

"It requires *control*." Sabine sat across from him, her dark eyes sharp. "Which brings me to your reports. I've read the last three. Twice."

She produced another folder, thicker this time. Max recognized his own handwriting—the detailed debriefs he'd filed after each encounter with Roxana. Standard procedure, documenting conversations, behavioral observations, intelligence gathered.

Sabine flipped to a marked page. "Quote: 'Roxana mentioned that she sometimes visits the Belvedere Museum on Tuesday afternoons when Viktor is in meetings. She stands in front of Klimt's "The Kiss" for exactly seven minutes. She says it reminds her of what love should feel like.'" Sabine looked up. "That's very poetic, Max. Also completely irrelevant to our operation."

Heat crept up Max's neck. "Context matters. Understanding her emotional state—"

"Here's another one." Sabine cut him off, turning pages. "'She has a small scar on her left wrist from a riding accident when she was twelve. She touched it unconsciously when talking about her father's expectations.' Tell me, how does her childhood horseback riding help us access Viktor's files?"

Max leaned back, the chair creaking ominously. Through the window, Vienna's evening lights were beginning to glow against the darkening sky. A tram rattled past below, its bell echoing off the narrow street.

"I'm being thorough," he said.

"You're being *attached*." Sabine closed the folder with a sharp snap. "There's a difference, and you know it. I've worked with you long enough to recognize the signs."

"What signs?"

"The level of detail. The tone. The way you describe her—it's shifting from analytical to... personal." She studied him with the same intensity she probably used during interrogations. "You're thinking about her between meetings, aren't you?"

Max said nothing, which was answer enough.

Sabine sighed, rubbing her temples. "Christ, Max. Of all the operations to develop feelings on."

"I haven't developed feelings. I'm doing my job."

"Your job is to get close enough to Roxana that she trusts you, then leverage that trust to access Viktor. Not to actually *care* what painting she stares at or what scars she has." Sabine's voice softened slightly. "I've seen this before. The target becomes a person instead of an asset. You start justifying the emotional involvement as operational necessity. But it's not—it's just you getting in too deep."

The radiator clanked, filling the silence. Max thought about Roxana's laugh two nights ago at the wine bar, the way rain had streaked the windows while they talked about everything and nothing. The moment their hands had touched, that electric current of attraction that had nothing to do with tradecraft.

"She's lonely," Max said quietly. "Viktor treats her like a trophy. She's intelligent, perceptive, and completely isolated in that marriage. You read my reports—you know what he's like."

"I know what *she says* he's like," Sabine corrected. "We've been monitoring Viktor Novak for six months. He's a cold bastard, yes, but he's also one of the most dangerous men in Vienna's intelligence community. And his wife—your new friend Roxana—grew up in Moscow, daughter of a GRU colonel. You think that's coincidence?"

Max had considered it, of course. But watching Roxana, listening to her talk about her suffocating marriage, seeing the genuine pain in her eyes—it didn't feel like an act.

"You think she's playing me?"

"I think it's possible. I also think you're too close to see it clearly." Sabine pulled out her phone, scrolled through something, then turned the screen toward him. "This was taken yesterday. Recognize the location?"

The photo showed Roxana entering a building in the 1st district. Max recognized it immediately—the same building where Viktor maintained a private office, separate from his official diplomatic cover.

"She visits her husband at work," Max said. "So what?"

"She stayed for forty-seven minutes. Then she left with this." Sabine swiped to the next image. Roxana exiting, carrying a slim leather portfolio. "We couldn't get close enough to see what was inside. But it's interesting timing, don't you think? Right as you're accelerating contact?"

The implication hung in the air like smoke. Max's mind raced through the possibilities, analyzing every conversation, every gesture, every seemingly spontaneous encounter. Had Roxana been too easy to approach? Too willing to confide?

"You're trying to shake me," he said finally. "Make me doubt the operation."

"I'm trying to keep you *alive*." Sabine leaned forward, her expression intense. "And I'm trying to remind you that this is a job, not a romance novel. Roxana Novak is either a victim of a cold marriage or she's an active participant in whatever Viktor is planning. Either way, your feelings about her are irrelevant."

"I don't have feelings—"

"Then why are you defending her?" Sabine's voice cracked like a whip. "A professional asset would say 'noted, I'll investigate the portfolio.' You're sitting there trying to convince me she's innocent."

Max opened his mouth, then closed it. She was right. Damn it, she was right.

Sabine's phone buzzed. She glanced at it, her expression darkening. "That's Langley. They want results, Max. The timeline is accelerating. We have intelligence suggesting Viktor is meeting with his Russian contacts next week—something big is moving. We need access to his communications before that happens."

"I'm working on it."

"Work faster." Sabine stood, gathering her folders. "You need to push Roxana harder. Get invited to the apartment. Get access to Viktor's home office. We need physical proximity, and we need it now."

"If I push too hard, I'll spook her. These things take time—"

"We don't have time." Sabine's voice was flat, final. "I'm giving you one week. Seven days to get inside that apartment and plant the surveillance equipment. After that, we pull you out and try a different approach."

"A week isn't enough to—"

"Then you'd better hope those feelings you don't have are reciprocated." Sabine moved to the door, then paused. "One more thing. The hand-touching at the wine bar? Our surveillance picked it up. So did Viktor's people. He has a tail on Roxana—has for months. They photograph everyone she meets, run facial recognition, background checks. Your cover will hold, but it means he knows about you now."

Ice water in his veins. "Does Roxana know she's being followed?"

"Hard to say. If she does, she's either accepted it or she's very good at pretending she hasn't noticed." Sabine unlocked the door. "Which brings us back to the central question: is she a

**Scene 5: Max invites Roxana to an intima...**

**Scene 5: Max invites Roxana to an intimate dinner at a small restaurant**

The restaurant was called *Glashaus*, tucked into a quiet corner of Neubau where the streets narrowed into cobblestone arteries and the tourists never wandered. Max had chosen it deliberately—far from the gilded establishments of the Innere Stadt where Viktor's diplomatic colleagues congregated, where a chance encounter might shatter everything he'd built over the past two weeks.

The interior glowed with amber warmth. Exposed brick walls held vintage photographs of old Vienna, and candles flickered in repurposed wine bottles on each table. Only eight tables total, half of them empty. The kind of place where conversations could happen in whispers or confessions.

Roxana arrived seven minutes late, raindrops still clinging to her dark hair. She'd dressed down—black jeans, a charcoal cashmere sweater, minimal jewelry. Max stood as she approached, noting how she scanned the room before sitting, cataloging exits and faces with the unconscious precision of someone who'd learned to be careful.

"This is lovely," she said, sliding into the chair across from him. "Very... off the beaten path."

"I thought you might appreciate somewhere without ambassadors and attachés." Max poured her wine from the bottle he'd already ordered—a Grüner Veltliner from a small Wachau vineyard. "Somewhere you could just be Roxana, not Frau Volkov."

She lifted the glass, studying him over the rim. "And who are you, Max? Just Max?"

The question landed with deceptive lightness, but Max caught the calculation behind it. He'd been trained to recognize interrogation techniques, even when delivered with a smile.

"Just Max," he confirmed, meeting her gaze. "Disappointingly ordinary."

"I doubt that." She sipped the wine, approved with a small nod. "In two weeks, you've mentioned your work in finance exactly three times, always in passing. You've told me about your apartment, your favorite bookshops, your opinions on half the museums in Vienna. But your family? Your childhood? The things that actually shape a person?" She set down the glass with deliberate precision. "Those remain conveniently vague."

Max felt his pulse quicken, though his expression remained unchanged. She was sharper than he'd anticipated, more observant than his briefing had suggested. He'd underestimated her, seduced by her beauty and apparent vulnerability into thinking she was simply a lonely diplomat's wife.

A dangerous mistake.

"My childhood wasn't particularly interesting," he said, reaching for the truth where he could—it made the lies more convincing. "Boarding schools in Switzerland. Parents who were more interested in their social calendar than their son. I learned early that people prefer the version of you that makes them comfortable, so I became very good at being whatever was needed."

Roxana's eyes narrowed slightly. "That's remarkably honest. Or remarkably calculated."

"Can't it be both?"

A waiter appeared, young and earnest, reciting specials in German. Roxana ordered the trout, Max the venison. When they were alone again, she leaned forward, candlelight catching the hollow of her throat.

"I've been thinking about our chance meeting at Café Central," she said. "How you happened to be reading Zweig. How you knew exactly which painting to discuss at the Belvedere. How every conversation we've had has touched on precisely the things I care about—art, literature, the suffocating nature of diplomatic life."

Max kept his breathing steady. "You think I've been following you?"

"I think you're either the most perfectly compatible person I've ever met, or you've done your homework." She traced the rim of her wine glass with one finger. "The question is why."

The restaurant felt suddenly smaller, the air thicker. Max had two choices: deflect or lean into the danger. His training screamed the former. His instinct—honed through years of reading people, of knowing when to push and when to retreat—chose the latter.

"Maybe I saw a beautiful woman sitting alone and wanted an excuse to talk to her," he said quietly. "Maybe I asked the barista what you usually ordered. Maybe I noticed the Klimt postcard in your bag and researched what you might like to discuss." He paused, holding her gaze. "Is that so terrible? To want to make an impression?"

Roxana's expression shifted, something flickering behind her eyes—surprise, perhaps, or recognition. "Most men would deny it. Play innocent."

"I'm not most men."

"No." She sat back, studying him with an intensity that made Max acutely aware of every micro-expression on his face. "You're not."

The food arrived, providing a temporary reprieve. They ate in silence for several minutes, but it was a charged silence, heavy with unspoken questions and half-revealed truths.

"My father was a professor," Roxana said finally, breaking the quiet. "Philosophy. He taught me to question everything, to look beneath the surface." She cut her trout with surgical precision. "He would have liked you, I think. Or been deeply suspicious of you. Possibly both."

"Was?"

"He died three years ago. Heart attack." Her voice remained steady, but Max saw her grip tighten on the knife. "Six months before I married Viktor."

Max processed this new information, recalibrating his understanding of her. A woman who'd lost her anchor, then married a man who offered security but not warmth. Vulnerable, yes, but not weak. Never weak.

"I'm sorry," he said, and meant it.

"Are you?" Roxana set down her utensils, fixing him with that penetrating stare again. "Or is that just something you know you should say?"

"Does it matter? If the sentiment serves the same purpose either way?"

"It matters to me." She reached for her wine, drained half the glass. "I've spent three years surrounded by people who say exactly what's expected, who perform sincerity like a rehearsed play. I thought you might be different. But maybe you're just better at the performance."

Max felt something shift in his chest—guilt, perhaps, or the first whisper of genuine regret. He'd run dozens of operations, seduced targets, extracted secrets, and walked away without looking back. But Roxana was different. Her intelligence, her loneliness, the way she saw through his carefully constructed facade—it made her dangerous in ways his handlers hadn't predicted.

It made her real.

"What if I told you I'm both?" he said. "That I did orchestrate our meeting, but that everything since has been... unexpected?"

Roxana's lips curved into something that wasn't quite a smile. "I'd say you're either telling the truth or you're very, very good at this."

"This?"

"Whatever this is." She gestured between them, the movement encompassing the intimate table, the wine, the weeks of carefully escalating encounters. "Seduction. Manipulation. Connection. Take your pick."

The word *seduction* hung in the air between them, impossible to ignore. Max felt the mission parameters dissolving, replaced by something more immediate, more visceral. He'd crossed professional lines before—it was sometimes necessary—but this felt different. This felt like standing at the edge of a cliff, knowing the fall would be catastrophic but unable to step back.

"What if it's all three?" he asked quietly.

Roxana held his gaze for a long moment, her dark eyes searching his face for something—truth, perhaps, or confirmation of her suspicions. Then she reached across the table, her fingers finding his, the touch electric in its simplicity.

"Then I suppose we're both in trouble," she said.

Outside, rain began to fall harder, drumming against the restaurant's windows. Max felt Roxana's hand warm against his, felt the weight of her trust and suspicion in equal measure. She knew something was off, knew he wasn't entirely what he claimed to be. But she hadn't walked away.

Which meant she was either playing her own game, or she was lonely enough not to care.

Max suspected it was both.

"Tell me something true," Roxana said, her thumb tracing small circles on his palm. "Just one thing. Something you haven't calculated or rehearsed."

Max thought about the apartment in Prague, the handler who'd given him this assignment, the photographs of Viktor's security clearances and Roxana's daily routines. He thought about the mission objectives, the timeline, the exit strategy already in place.

Then he looked at Roxana—really looked at her—and saw not a target but a woman who'd been performing her own role for so long she'd almost forgotten who she was underneath.

"I think about you between our meetings," he said, the admission dangerous in its honesty. "More than I should. More than is smart."

Roxana's expression softened, vulnerability breaking through her careful composure. "That's either the truest thing you've

**Scene 6: After dinner, Max walks Roxana ...**

**Scene 6: After dinner, Max walks Roxana to her car in the rain**

The rain arrived without warning, transforming Vienna's elegant streets into rivers of reflected light. Max held his jacket over Roxana's head as they hurried from the restaurant, her laughter bright against the drumming of water on pavement.

"My car's just around the corner," she said, but when they turned onto Seilergasse, she stopped short. "Or it was."

The parking space stood empty, a puddle forming where her Mercedes had been.

"Towed?" Max asked.

"Viktor's driver." Roxana's voice went flat. "He tracks my phone. Must have decided I'd been out long enough."

Max felt a flash of anger—not fabricated for the mission, but genuine. The control, the surveillance. It was one thing to read about it in a dossier, another to see the resignation in her eyes.

"There's a place just there," he said, nodding toward a wine bar across the street. Its windows glowed amber, promising warmth. "We can call you a taxi. Get dry first."

She hesitated only a moment before nodding.

The bar was the kind of place tourists never found—small, wood-paneled, with perhaps a dozen tables scattered across an uneven floor. A fire crackled in a stone hearth. Only three other patrons occupied the space, speaking in low voices that blended with the jazz playing softly from hidden speakers.

They claimed a table near the fire. Max ordered a bottle of Grüner Veltliner without consulting the menu, and the bartender—a woman in her sixties with knowing eyes—brought it with two glasses and a basket of bread.

"You've been here before," Roxana observed, shrugging out of her damp coat.

"Once or twice." A lie. He'd scouted it last week, noting the discrete corners and the staff who minded their own business. "It's off the beaten path."

"Like you prefer." She accepted the wine he poured, her fingers brushing his as she took the glass. "I've noticed you avoid the places where people like Viktor go."

"People like Viktor?"

"Powerful. Connected. The ones who own Vienna instead of just living in it." She sipped her wine, studying him over the rim. "You're careful about that. Why?"

Because those were the places with cameras, with gossip, with people who might recognize him from another life, another identity. But he couldn't say that.

"I spent too many years in rooms full of people who thought they mattered," he said instead. "After my wife died, I realized most of it was performance. I prefer things that are real now."

Roxana's expression softened. "I understand that more than you know."

The fire popped, sending sparks up the chimney. Outside, rain lashed the windows. Inside, the warmth wrapped around them like a cocoon, separating them from the world.

They talked as the bottle emptied—about the performance of marriage, the weight of expectations, the small rebellions that kept you sane. Roxana's guard dropped with each glass, her words becoming more honest, more raw.

"Sometimes I park somewhere and just sit," she confessed. "For an hour, two hours. Just to have time that's mine. Isn't that pathetic?"

"It's survival."

"Is it?" She laughed, but there was no humor in it. "I used to paint, did I tell you that? Before I married Viktor. I was actually quite good. He has three of my pieces in his office, but I haven't touched a brush in four years. He says it's because I'm too busy with charity work, but we both know the truth."

"What's the truth?"

"That he likes me as an accessory. Beautiful, cultured, perfectly presented. Actually creating something, being passionate about something that isn't him—that would make me too real. Too separate."

Max reached for the wine bottle to refill her glass, and Roxana reached for it at the same moment. Their hands collided, fingers overlapping on the rain-slicked glass.

Neither pulled away.

The moment stretched, seconds becoming elastic. Max felt the warmth of her skin, saw the pulse at her throat quicken. Her eyes held his—dark, uncertain, wanting.

He should withdraw. Should laugh it off, make a joke, maintain the careful distance he'd been calibrating for two weeks. This was the moment to be professional, to remember why he was here.

Instead, he turned his hand, threading his fingers through hers.

"Max." His name was barely a whisper.

"I know."

"This is—"

"Dangerous. Yes."

But she didn't pull away. Her thumb traced the edge of his palm, a touch so light it might have been accidental if not for the intention in her eyes.

"I should go," Roxana said, but she didn't move.

"You should."

The fire crackled. Rain hammered the windows. Somewhere in the back of the bar, a cork popped from a bottle.

Max knew he was crossing a line. Not just for the mission—that line had been drawn from the start—but for himself. The part of him that remained Max Monroe, that still remembered what it meant to want something beyond the objective, beyond the handler's instructions and the carefully constructed lies.

He was supposed to seduce her. That was the mission. But this—this feeling in his chest, this tightness when she smiled, this anger at how Viktor treated her—this wasn't supposed to be real.

"Roxana," he started, not knowing what he meant to say.

She leaned forward, close enough that he could smell her perfume, feel the warmth of her breath.

"Don't," she whispered. "Don't say whatever you're about to say. Not yet. Just... let me have this moment. This one real moment."

Outside, lightning flashed, briefly illuminating the rain-soaked street. In its stark light, Max saw his reflection in the window—a man who'd worn so many faces he'd almost forgotten his own.

But when he looked back at Roxana, he saw something he recognized: someone else trapped in a performance, desperate for something authentic.

His phone buzzed in his pocket. Once, then twice. The signal from his handler. Time to extract, to maintain distance, to keep the operation clean.

Max silenced it without looking.

"Come on," he said, standing but not releasing her hand. "I'll get you that taxi."

"And if I don't want a taxi?"

The question hung between them, loaded with implications that went far beyond the mission parameters, beyond what he'd been trained to handle.

"Then we'll finish the wine," Max said quietly. "And figure out what comes next."

Roxana smiled—small, uncertain, but real. She squeezed his hand.

"Okay."

As Max poured the last of the wine, he felt the weight of what he'd just done. There was no going back now. He'd crossed the line from operative to something messier, more complicated.

More human.

And somewhere in Vienna, in an apartment Max had never seen, Viktor Volkov's phone would be showing his wife's location, static in a wine bar she'd never mentioned, with a man whose name he didn't know.

The trap was set.

Max just wasn't sure anymore who would be caught in it.

## Chapter 4: Complications

**Scene 1: Sabine Voss arrives unannounced...**

The knock came at 6:47 a.m., three sharp raps that shattered the silence of Max's apartment like gunshots.

He was already awake, sitting at the small kitchen table with cold coffee and a newspaper he wasn't reading. The safe house occupied the third floor of a nondescript building in Vienna's 7th district—all beige walls and functional furniture that could belong to anyone and no one. Through the window, the city was just beginning to stir, streetlights flickering off as dawn bled gray across the rooftops.

Max knew who it was before he reached the door. Only one person knocked like that—like they owned whatever was on the other side.

Sabine Voss stood in the hallway, immaculate in a charcoal suit despite the early hour and whatever red-eye flight had brought her here. Her black hair was pulled back severely, and her eyes—always her most dangerous feature—swept past him into the apartment with the efficiency of a tactical assessment.

"You going to invite me in, or should we have this conversation where your neighbors can hear it?"

Max stepped aside. Sabine moved past him, bringing with her the scent of airport coffee and the particular tension that always preceded bad news. She didn't wait for permission before dropping her leather attaché case on his kitchen table and shrugging off her coat.

"You look like shit," she said, turning to face him.

"Good morning to you too."

"It's not a good morning, Max. It hasn't been a good morning for three weeks." She pulled out a chair and sat, gesturing for him to do the same. The motion was casual, but Max recognized the performance. Sabine Voss didn't do casual. Every movement was calculated, every word a chess piece sliding into position.

He remained standing, leaning against the counter with his arms crossed. "I wasn't expecting a visit."

"No, I imagine you weren't." She opened the attaché case with two precise clicks. "That's part of the problem. You seem to have forgotten that people are watching. That this operation has stakeholders who expect results."

"I'm making progress."

"Are you?" She extracted a manila folder, set it on the table between them like a challenge. "Because from where I'm sitting—from where *Langley* is sitting—you've been on the ground for twenty-one days with nothing to show for it except restaurant receipts and a concerning pattern of behavior."

Max felt his jaw tighten. "I've established contact. I'm building trust. This isn't the kind of thing you rush."

"Trust." Sabine repeated the word as if tasting something bitter. "Is that what we're calling it?"

She flipped open the folder. Even from across the room, Max could see the photographs—8x10 glossies that captured moments he'd thought were private. Him and Roxana at the Naschmarkt, her laughing at something he'd said. The two of them on a bench in the Stadtpark, sitting closer than necessary. Another shot from three days ago: Roxana's hand on his arm outside a café, her face turned up toward his with an expression that made his chest constrict even now.

"Professional distance, Max. Remember that concept? They covered it in training, right between 'don't get made' and 'don't fuck the target's wife.'"

The anger came hot and immediate. Max pushed off the counter, closing the distance between them. "She's not the target. Viktor is."

"And yet somehow you've spent more time with her than gathering intelligence on him." Sabine's voice remained level, clinical. "You've been to exactly two locations where Viktor conducts business. Two. In three weeks. Meanwhile, you've had coffee with Roxana Volkov seven times. Lunch four times. Dinner twice. Should I go on?"

"I'm using her to get close to him. That's the play. That's always been the play."

"The play was to get close enough to identify his network and document his transactions. Not to—" She tapped one of the photographs, the one from the park. "Whatever this is."

Max grabbed the photo, studied it with forced detachment. Roxana had been telling him about her childhood in Moscow that day, about the grandmother who'd taught her to paint in secret because her father thought art was frivolous. The sunlight had caught in her hair, and for just a moment, he'd forgotten why he was there.

"It's called establishing cover," he said, tossing the photo back onto the table.

Sabine stood, eliminating the height advantage he'd had over her. At five-foot-six, she still managed to make him feel small. "Don't insult my intelligence. I've been running assets since before you learned to shave. I know what establishing cover looks like, and I know what compromise looks like. Guess which one I'm seeing in these photos?"

The apartment suddenly felt too warm, too small. Max moved to the window, staring out at the street below where a woman was walking a small dog, her breath misting in the cold morning air. Normal life. Simple problems.

"Why are you really here, Sabine?"

He heard her move behind him, the whisper of fabric as she leaned against the table. When she spoke again, her voice had lost some of its edge. Not softness—Sabine Voss didn't do soft—but something closer to concern.

"NSA intercepted communications two days ago. Encrypted traffic between Viktor and someone in Moscow. They're planning a major transfer—documents, possibly physical assets. We don't have the details yet, but the chatter suggests it's happening soon. Within the week."

Max turned. "What kind of documents?"

"The kind that could compromise every operation we're running in Eastern Europe. The kind that get people killed." She pulled out another folder, this one thinner. "Viktor's not just a money launderer anymore. He's brokering information. High-level intelligence that he's selling to the highest bidder. If this transfer happens and we're not in position to intercept..."

She didn't need to finish. Max understood the implications. Understood why she'd flown halfway around the world to deliver this warning in person.

"You need to accelerate the timeline," Sabine continued. "Whatever you've been doing, it's not fast enough. We need access to his network, his contacts, his schedule. We need it now."

"And if rushing it spooks him?"

"Then you'd better make sure it doesn't." She began gathering the photographs, sliding them back into the folder with efficient movements. "I'm not pulling you. Not yet. But I need to know you're still capable of doing this job. That you haven't lost perspective."

"I haven't."

She paused, one hand on the attaché case, and looked at him with those sharp, knowing eyes. "Max, I've seen good agents get tangled up before. It happens. The cover becomes too real, the lies start feeling like truth. It's human. But it's also fatal."

"I'm fine."

"Are you? Because the Max Monroe I trained would have already found a way into Viktor's inner circle. That Max wouldn't have needed three weeks to—"

"That Max didn't have to convince a paranoid Russian oligarch that he's trustworthy," Max cut in, his voice harder than intended. "Viktor Volkov doesn't let people in easily. Every move has to be calculated. One wrong step and I'm burned."

Sabine closed the case with a decisive snap. "Then don't make a wrong step. But make *some* step. Soon." She picked up her coat, shrugged it on with practiced efficiency. "I'm staying at the Imperial until Friday. I want an update every twelve hours. And Max?"

He met her gaze.

"The woman in those photos—Roxana Volkov. She's not who you think she is. She's married to a monster, which means she's either complicit or she's a victim playing a very dangerous game. Either way, she's not someone you can save. Don't make this about her."

The words landed like physical blows, but Max kept his expression neutral. "It's not about her. It's about the mission."

Sabine studied him for a long moment, and Max had the uncomfortable sensation of being X-rayed, every hidden thought and feeling exposed under her scrutiny. Finally, she nodded, though her expression suggested she didn't believe him.

"See that it stays that way."

She left without another word, the door clicking shut with a finality that seemed to suck the air from the room. Max stood motionless, listening to her footsteps recede down the hallway, then the distant sound of the building's main door opening and closing.

Only then did he move back to the table, to the folder Sabine had left behind—deliberately, he suspected. He opened it, spreading the photographs across the surface. Each one told a story he'd been trying not to acknowledge. The way he leaned toward Roxana. The way she looke

**Scene 2: After Sabine's departure, Max r...**

**Scene 2: After Sabine's departure, Max reviews the surveillance photos alone and struggles with his conflicting feelings about the mission**

The door clicked shut behind Sabine, and the silence that followed felt like a physical weight pressing down on Max's chest. He stood motionless in the center of his safe house apartment, listening to her footsteps fade down the hallway, counting the seconds until the elevator chimed.

Only then did he exhale.

The apartment was a study in calculated anonymity—generic IKEA furniture, beige walls, curtains that let in just enough light to seem lived-in but not enough to reveal much from the outside. The kind of place that could be abandoned in fifteen minutes without leaving a trace. Max had lived in dozens of apartments like this over the years, each one as forgettable as the last.

He moved to the kitchen counter where Sabine had left the manila envelope. The surveillance photos spilled out when he tipped it, glossy eight-by-tens scattering across the laminate surface like accusations.

There he was at Café Central, leaning across the table, his hand covering Roxana's. The angle made it look more intimate than he remembered, though maybe that was the lie he was telling himself. Another photo: the two of them walking through the Volksgarten, her head tilted toward him, laughing at something he'd said. His own expression in that shot made him look away—too open, too unguarded.

Too real.

Max picked up the photo from last Thursday. They were standing outside the Kunsthistorisches Museum, and Roxana had just brushed something from his collar. The gesture had lasted maybe three seconds, but the camera had frozen it perfectly—her fingers against his shoulder, his eyes on her face, both of them suspended in a moment that had felt, even then, like crossing a line.

"Christ," he muttered, shoving the photos back into the envelope.

He crossed to the window, careful to stand to the side of the frame, and looked out at the street below. A tram rattled past, its windows glowing warm against the gathering dusk. Ordinary people heading home from ordinary jobs, their biggest concerns probably what to make for dinner or whether they'd remembered to pay the electric bill.

Max couldn't remember the last time his life had felt ordinary.

His phone buzzed on the counter, and he felt his pulse quicken before he even looked at it. He'd programmed different vibration patterns for different contacts—a habit born from years of needing to know who was reaching out before he even pulled the device from his pocket.

This pattern wasn't Sabine's. Wasn't the agency's emergency line.

He picked up the phone, and Roxana's name glowed on the screen.

*There's a gallery opening tomorrow night. Contemporary photography—probably pretentious, but the wine is usually decent. Interested?*

Max stared at the message, his thumb hovering over the screen. The smart play was to wait, to not seem too eager. Better yet, to decline altogether. Put some distance between them, slow things down, heed Sabine's warning about getting too close.

His phone buzzed again.

*Viktor will be there. Fair warning.*

Three dots appeared, then disappeared, then appeared again. He could picture her on the other end, debating whether to send whatever she was typing, her bottom lip caught between her teeth the way it was when she was thinking.

*But I'd like you to come anyway.*

The apartment felt suddenly too small, the walls too close. Max set the phone down and walked to the bedroom, then back to the kitchen, his mind cycling through the implications. Meeting Viktor face-to-face would be useful—essential, even. He could assess the target, look for vulnerabilities, start building the psychological profile he'd need for the eventual approach.

That was the professional justification.

The truth sat in his chest like a stone: he wanted to see her. Wanted to be in the same room with her, even if her husband was there. Especially if her husband was there, because maybe seeing them together would break whatever spell he was under, would remind him that this was a job and she was a means to an end.

Or maybe he just wanted to see what kind of man Viktor Volkov was. What kind of man treated a woman like Roxana as if she were something to be possessed rather than cherished.

His phone buzzed a fourth time.

*No pressure. I know it's short notice.*

Max picked up the phone, and this time his thumb moved before his brain could intervene.

*I'll be there. Send me the details.*

The response came within seconds: a pin drop showing a gallery in the seventh district, followed by a time and a simple *Thank you* with a small heart emoji that she probably agonized over before sending.

He set the phone down and returned to the window, watching the street lamps flicker to life one by one. Somewhere in this city, Viktor Volkov was sitting in his expensive apartment or his exclusive club, making plans to sell state secrets to the highest bidder. Somewhere, Sabine Voss was filing her report, noting her concerns about the asset's emotional state and reliability.

And here Max stood, in his forgettable apartment with its forgettable furniture, having just made a choice that he knew—*knew*—was the wrong one.

The surveillance photos lay on the counter where he'd left them, edges curling slightly in the dry heat from the radiator. Max walked over and looked at them one more time, really looked, trying to see what Sabine had seen. Trying to see the compromise, the liability, the professional getting too close to the target's wife.

Instead, he saw Roxana's smile. The way she looked at him like he was someone worth knowing, someone real rather than the carefully constructed fiction he'd been selling her.

He gathered the photos and slid them back into the envelope, then locked it in the safe hidden behind the loose panel in the bathroom. Out of sight, but not out of mind. Never out of mind.

His phone buzzed once more. Not Roxana this time, but an encrypted message from the agency's Vienna station: new intelligence suggested the document transfer would happen within the next two weeks, possibly sooner. The timeline was collapsing faster than anticipated.

Max deleted the message and walked to the small desk in the corner, pulling out a notebook. He began sketching out what he knew about Viktor Volkov—his routines, his associates, his weaknesses. The kind of preparation he should have been doing all along instead of spending his afternoons in cafés, getting lost in conversations that had nothing to do with the mission.

But even as he worked, part of his mind was already at tomorrow's gallery opening. Already imagining the moment when Roxana would introduce him to her husband, when he'd have to shake Viktor's hand and smile and play the role of the charming American expatriate who just happened to befriend a lonely woman in a coffee shop.

Already anticipating the look in her eyes when she saw him across the room.

Outside, the city settled into its evening rhythm. Somewhere a church bell tolled the hour. Max wrote until his hand cramped, filling pages with observations and strategies and contingency plans.

None of them addressed the real complication: that he was walking into that gallery tomorrow not because it was good tradecraft, but because he couldn't stay away.

And that, more than any surveillance photo or handler's warning, was what should have terrified him.

**Scene 3: Max arrives at the upscale Vie...**

**Scene 3: Max arrives at the upscale Vienna gallery opening**

The Galerie Hofburg occupied a converted palace on Bräunerstraße, its limestone facade glowing amber under strategically placed spotlights. Max adjusted his tie as he approached the entrance, where a young woman in black checked names against a tablet. Through the tall windows, he could see clusters of well-dressed guests moving beneath crystal chandeliers, champagne flutes catching the light like scattered diamonds.

"Max Monroe," he said, offering his invitation.

She smiled and gestured him inside.

The gallery's interior was all soaring ceilings and pristine white walls, the contemporary art stark against the baroque architecture. Abstract canvases in violent reds and blacks dominated the main room—angry slashes of color that seemed at odds with the refined crowd examining them. The air hummed with multilingual conversation, punctuated by the delicate clink of crystal and carefully modulated laughter.

Max accepted champagne from a passing waiter and scanned the room. Diplomats, he recognized the type immediately. The particular way they held themselves, the calculated warmth of their smiles. A silver-haired man near the entrance wore a Lebanese flag pin on his lapel. Two women by the far wall spoke rapid French, their body language suggesting embassy colleagues rather than friends.

"You came."

He turned to find Roxana approaching, and for a moment forgot the room entirely. She wore a deep emerald dress that brought out the green in her hazel eyes, her dark hair swept up to reveal the elegant line of her neck. A simple diamond pendant rested at her throat—tasteful, expensive, probably a gift from Viktor.

"I said I would," Max replied, surprised by how genuine his smile felt.

She touched his arm lightly, a greeting that lasted a fraction too long to be merely polite. "Come, let me introduce you to some people. Fair warning—most of them are terribly boring."

There was a brightness in her eyes tonight, an energy he hadn't seen before. In the café, she'd been guarded, careful. Here, surrounded by the trappings of her world, she seemed almost defiant.

She led him to a portly man with thick eyebrows who turned out to be the Austrian Deputy Minister of Culture. "Ambassador Richter, this is Max Monroe, a business consultant I met recently. Max, the Ambassador was just telling me his theory about post-modern expressionism."

"Ah yes," Richter said, warming to his subject immediately. "You see, the artist is making a statement about the dissolution of meaning in contemporary society..."

Max nodded at appropriate intervals, but his attention kept drifting to Roxana. She played her role perfectly—the attentive diplomat's wife, asking intelligent questions, laughing at weak jokes. But he caught the slight tension in her shoulders, the way her smile never quite reached her eyes when speaking to anyone but him.

They moved through the crowd like that, Roxana introducing him to a succession of faces that blurred together. A German cultural attaché. A Swiss banker and his wife. An Italian journalist who'd had too much champagne and kept touching Roxana's arm until Max stepped subtly between them.

"Thank you," Roxana murmured as they moved away. "Giovanni gets handsy after his third glass."

"Noticed that, did you?"

"I've been navigating these events for eight years. You develop a sense for these things." She paused before a particularly violent canvas—black paint slashed across blood red. "What do you think of the art?"

Max studied it. "Angry."

"Yes." Something shifted in her expression. "The artist is Croatian. She lost her family in the war. This whole series is about trauma and displacement."

"Heavy subject for a cocktail party."

"That's Vienna for you. We like our darkness beautifully packaged." Roxana's gaze remained on the painting. "Sometimes I think that's all we are here—terrible things wrapped in culture and civility."

The mask had slipped, just for a moment. Max saw past the diplomat's wife to something raw underneath. Before he could respond, a waiter appeared with fresh champagne. Roxana took a glass, the moment passing.

"Tell me," she said, her tone lighter now, "what does a business consultant think of all this? The art, the people, the spectacle?"

"I think," Max said carefully, "that everyone here is performing. Playing their part."

"And what part are you playing, Max?"

Their eyes met. The question hung between them, weighted with meanings he couldn't afford to acknowledge.

"The interested stranger," he said finally. "The American who doesn't quite understand the rules."

"And is that what you are?"

Before he could answer, a shift in the room's energy made Roxana stiffen. Max felt it too—a subtle parting of the crowd, conversations adjusting their volume. He turned to see a man entering through the main doors.

Viktor Volkov.

Max recognized him from the surveillance photos, but they hadn't captured the physical presence of the man. Tall, broad-shouldered, moving with the confidence of someone accustomed to deference. His suit was Savile Row, his watch a Patek Philippe that cost more than most people's cars. Cold blue eyes swept the room with the assessment of a predator evaluating territory.

Those eyes found Roxana, and something in her posture changed. The brightness dimmed. The defiance collapsed inward.

"I should go greet my husband," she said quietly.

But Viktor was already approaching, the crowd parting before him like water. Two men flanked him—security, trying and failing to look like ordinary guests. Max recognized the type. Ex-military, probably Spetsnaz. The kind of men who killed efficiently and slept soundly afterward.

"Roxana." Viktor's voice was deep, accented, utterly without warmth. He didn't kiss her, didn't touch her. Just acknowledged her presence like one might notice a familiar piece of furniture.

Then those cold eyes fixed on Max.

"And who is this?"

"Max Monroe," Roxana said, her voice steady despite the tension radiating from her. "An American consultant. I met him at Café Central last week. Max, my husband, Viktor Volkov."

Max extended his hand. Viktor's grip was crushing, deliberate. A test, a warning, a claim of dominance all in one gesture.

"American," Viktor said, as if tasting something unpleasant. "What brings you to Vienna, Mr. Monroe?"

"Business opportunities. Eastern European market expansion."

"Ah. And you enjoy art?"

"I'm learning to appreciate it."

Viktor's smile didn't reach his eyes. "How nice that my wife has time to educate strangers while I work." He turned to Roxana, dismissing Max entirely. "The Ambassador from Belarus is here. You should speak with his wife. She's been asking about you."

It wasn't a suggestion.

"Of course," Roxana said.

Viktor moved away without another word, his security detail following. Roxana started to go, then paused, turning back to Max. For just a second, her hand found his, squeezed once.

"Stay," she whispered. "Please."

Then she was gone, gliding across the gallery toward a severe-looking woman in pearls. Max watched her go, watched Viktor hold court across the room, watched the way Roxana's shoulders curved inward when her husband glanced her way.

The champagne had gone flat in his hand. He set it down on a nearby table and studied the angry Croatian paintings, thinking about trauma and displacement, about terrible things wrapped in beauty.

His phone buzzed. A text from Sabine: *Remember what I said. Don't let it get personal.*

Max deleted the message and looked back at Roxana, laughing at something the Ambassador's wife had said, playing her part perfectly in this elegant, suffocating world.

Too late, he thought.

It was already personal.

**Scene 4: Viktor Volkov makes his entran...**

**Scene 4: Viktor Volkov makes his entrance**

The temperature in the gallery dropped before Viktor Volkov even appeared.

Max felt it—a subtle shift in the room's energy, conversations becoming more deliberate, laughter more controlled. Roxana's hand tensed on his arm mid-sentence, her fingers suddenly rigid against his jacket sleeve.

"He's here," she whispered, and Max heard something he'd never detected in her voice before: fear.

Viktor entered like a man who owned not just the gallery but everyone in it. Tall, silver-haired, impeccably dressed in a charcoal suit that probably cost more than Max's monthly salary, he moved through the crowd with the casual authority of someone who'd never been told no. Two men flanked him—bodyguards trying to look like guests, but Max recognized the telltale signs: the slight bulge under the left shoulder, the way their eyes constantly scanned the room, the positioning that kept Viktor's flanks protected.

The Russian oligarch's gaze swept across the space, cataloging, assessing, dismissing. When his eyes found Roxana, his expression didn't soften. If anything, it hardened.

Max felt Roxana pull away from him, creating distance, erasing the intimacy of their conversation. She smoothed her dress—the emerald silk that hugged her figure perfectly—and Max saw her shoulders straighten, her chin lift. Preparing for battle.

Viktor crossed the gallery floor in long strides, people parting before him like water around a stone. He didn't acknowledge the greetings thrown his way, didn't pause to admire the artwork. His attention remained fixed on his wife.

"Roxana." His voice carried the trace of a Moscow accent, smooth as aged vodka and just as capable of burning. "I see you've found someone to entertain you."

"Viktor, this is Michael Harper," Roxana said, her voice carefully neutral. "He's an art consultant from London. We were discussing the Richter piece."

Max extended his hand, keeping his expression pleasant, unremarkable. "Mr. Volkov. Your wife has been very gracious, helping me understand the Vienna art scene."

Viktor's handshake was brief, perfunctory, his palm cold and dry. His eyes—pale gray, like winter ice—assessed Max with the same dispassion he might show a piece of furniture. Max had been evaluated by dangerous men before, but Viktor's gaze carried something different: the absolute certainty that Max posed no threat, that he was beneath consideration.

"Art consultant." Viktor's lips curved in something that wasn't quite a smile. "How quaint." He turned to Roxana, dismissing Max entirely. "That dress is inappropriate."

Roxana's cheek twitched. "You said to wear something elegant."

"Elegant, yes. Not something that makes you look like you're advertising yourself." His hand closed around her elbow, fingers pressing into the soft flesh. "The Hoffmans are here. And the Dubrovs. You should be speaking with them, not wasting time with..." He glanced back at Max, as if he'd already forgotten his name.

"Of course." Roxana's voice had gone flat, lifeless. The vibrant woman who'd been laughing with Max moments ago had disappeared behind a mask of compliance.

"Excuse us, Mr. Harper," Viktor said, already turning away, already pulling Roxana with him.

Max watched Viktor steer her across the room, his hand still gripping her elbow, positioning her like a chess piece. Roxana didn't resist, didn't look back. She'd become a different person entirely—smaller somehow, diminished.

The gallery's ambient noise rushed back in: the clink of champagne glasses, the murmur of cultured conversation, the soft classical music filtering through hidden speakers. But Max barely heard it over the white noise of rage building in his chest.

He'd seen the photographs in Roxana's file. He'd read the psychological profile Sabine had compiled. He'd known, intellectually, that Viktor Volkov was a controlling husband, that the marriage was a transaction rather than a partnership. But knowing something and witnessing it were entirely different things.

Across the room, Viktor positioned Roxana beside an older couple—the Hoffmans, presumably—and Max watched her smile activate like a switch being flipped. She laughed at something the older man said, touched his arm with practiced charm. Playing her role. Being the perfect accessory.

Viktor's hand remained on her back, possessive, controlling. Even from this distance, Max could see the pressure of his fingers, the way Roxana's posture shifted to accommodate his touch.

"Quite the performance, isn't it?"

Max turned to find a woman in her sixties standing beside him, champagne glass in hand, watching the Volkovs with shrewd eyes.

"I'm sorry?"

"Viktor and his beautiful wife. They put on such a good show." The woman's smile was knowing, sad. "I've known Roxana since she was a girl in St. Petersburg. Brilliant pianist. She could have had a real career, you know. Before."

Before Viktor, Max understood. Before she became a possession.

"She seems very accomplished," Max said carefully.

"Accomplished at surviving." The woman sipped her champagne. "Which is its own kind of art, I suppose."

She drifted away, leaving Max alone with his thoughts and the cold fury still coiling in his gut.

This was dangerous. Sabine had warned him, and she'd been right. He was supposed to be cultivating Roxana as an asset, exploiting her vulnerabilities to gain access to Viktor's operations. Clinical. Professional. Detached.

But watching Viktor parade her around the gallery like a prized possession, seeing the way she'd transformed from animated and genuine into something hollow and performed—Max felt anything but detached.

His phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number.

*Thank you for earlier. For making me laugh. I'd forgotten what that felt like. —E*

Max looked up. Across the gallery, Roxana stood beside Viktor, smiling at something the Dubrovs were saying. But her eyes found Max's, just for a moment, and in that brief glance he saw the real woman trapped behind the performance.

His phone was still in his hand. He should delete the message, maintain proper operational distance. Instead, he typed a response.

*Same time tomorrow? The Belvedere has a new installation.*

He watched her check her phone, saw the tiny smile that flickered across her face before she schooled her expression back to neutral. She didn't respond, but she didn't need to. The answer was in the way she looked at him again, in the silent promise of her eyes.

Viktor's hand slid lower on her back, and Max had to turn away before his expression betrayed him.

This was no longer just a mission. It had become something else entirely, something complicated and dangerous and utterly unavoidable.

Sabine was going to kill him.

But as Max left the gallery, stepping out into Vienna's cool night air, he found he didn't care. Tomorrow he would see Roxana again. Tomorrow he would make her laugh, make her feel seen, give her a few hours of freedom from the cage her life had become.

And if that happened to serve the mission's objectives, all the better.

He was still trying to convince himself of that lie when his phone buzzed again.

*2 PM. Don't be late. —E*

Max smiled into the darkness, ignoring the voice in his head that sounded suspiciously like Sabine, warning him that he'd just crossed a line he could never uncross.

Some lines, he decided, were meant to be crossed.

**Scene 5: As the gallery event winds dow...**

**Scene 5: As the gallery event winds down**

The gallery had emptied to a handful of stragglers nursing wine in hushed conversations. Max watched Viktor check his Patek Philippe for the third time in as many minutes, his jaw tight with barely concealed impatience.

"I have a conference call with Moscow in forty minutes," Viktor announced to no one in particular, already moving toward the exit. Two men in dark suits materialized from the corners of the room—security, always security. He paused near Roxana, his hand briefly touching her shoulder with the casual possession of someone handling property. "Don't stay too late. You know how I worry."

The lie was so transparent it made Max's teeth clench.

Roxana's smile never wavered. "Of course, darling. I'll be home soon."

Viktor nodded to Max with the barest acknowledgment—a slight tilt of the head that managed to convey both dismissal and warning—then swept out into the Vienna night, his entourage trailing behind like shadows.

The silence he left behind felt like a released breath.

Roxana stood perfectly still for a moment, her champagne glass suspended halfway to her lips. Then she drained it in one smooth motion and set it down on a nearby pedestal with a soft click that seemed too loud in the thinning crowd.

"I should go," she said, but made no move toward the door.

Max stepped closer, close enough to catch the subtle scent of her perfume—something with jasmine and amber. "Let me walk you home. It's a beautiful evening."

She turned to look at him, and in the gallery's soft lighting, her eyes held a complexity he hadn't seen before. Not just sadness, but something sharper. Intelligence. Calculation. Awareness.

"That would be dangerous, Mr. Monroe."

"Max," he corrected. "And I'm willing to risk it."

A smile ghosted across her lips. "I wasn't talking about the danger to you."

She collected her clutch and pashmina, and together they stepped out into the cool Vienna evening. The temperature had dropped, autumn asserting itself against the last warmth of summer. The cobblestones gleamed under the streetlights, still damp from an earlier rain Max hadn't noticed while inside.

They walked in silence at first, their footsteps echoing off the baroque facades that lined the narrow street. The gallery was in the Innere Stadt, the historic center, all elegant architecture and carefully preserved grandeur. At night, with the tourists gone, it felt like walking through a museum of empire.

"Do you know what I love about Vienna?" Roxana asked suddenly. She'd wrapped the pashmina around her shoulders, but hadn't taken his arm, maintaining a careful distance between them. "It's a city built on the memory of power. The Habsburgs are gone, the empire is dust, but the buildings remain. Beautiful, empty monuments to something that no longer exists."

Max glanced at her profile, the way the streetlight caught the curve of her cheek. "That's a melancholy thought."

"Is it?" She paused at a corner, looking up at a building facade decorated with stone cherubs. "I find it comforting, actually. It means nothing lasts forever. Not power. Not control. Not even the things that seem permanent."

They turned onto Herrengasse, moving deeper into the first district. The street was quieter here, the shops closed, only the occasional café spilling warm light onto the pavement.

"How long have you been married?" Max asked, though he knew the answer. Three years, two months. The file had been thorough.

"Long enough to forget what it felt like to choose something for myself." She said it lightly, almost casually, but there was steel underneath. "Do you know what Viktor gave me for our anniversary last month? A necklace. Diamonds and sapphires. Worth more than most people make in a year."

"You don't sound happy about it."

"I'm not ungrateful," she said quickly, then caught herself. A rueful smile. "Listen to me. Complaining about diamonds. What kind of person does that make me?"

"Human," Max said.

They walked past a darkened bookshop, its window display featuring leather-bound volumes arranged like art. Roxana slowed, studying the books with an intensity that suggested she was seeing something else entirely.

"He chose it himself," she continued, her voice quieter now. "The necklace. Picked the stones, approved the design. It's exquisite. Perfect. And I hate it because it's exactly what he wanted me to wear, exactly how he wanted me to look. I'm not even sure he knows my favorite color."

"What is it?"

She turned to him, surprised. "What?"

"Your favorite color."

For a moment, she just looked at him, and Max saw something shift in her expression—a wall lowering, just slightly. "Green. Not emerald or jade. The green of leaves in spring, when they're still new."

"The color of possibility," Max said.

"Yes." The word came out as barely more than a whisper. "Exactly that."

They continued walking, and this time when Roxana stumbled slightly on an uneven cobblestone, Max offered his arm. She hesitated only a second before taking it.

The contact sent electricity through him—not just attraction, though God knew that was there, but something more complicated. Guilt. Anticipation. The sick knowledge that every moment of this intimacy was built on deception.

"Tell me something true about yourself, Max Monroe," Roxana said as they crossed Michaelerplatz, the imperial palace looming to their left. "Something you don't tell everyone."

The question was a trap, and they both knew it. Truth was currency in their world—his world of lies, her world of careful survival. To offer it was to make yourself vulnerable.

"I had a sister," Max heard himself say. The words came from somewhere deep, somewhere he usually kept locked. "Emma. She died when I was nineteen. Car accident. Drunk driver ran a red light."

Roxana's grip on his arm tightened. "I'm sorry."

"She was going to be a teacher. Elementary school. She was good with kids—patient in a way I never was. Sometimes I think about all the children she would have taught, all the lives she would have touched. All that possibility, just... gone. Because someone made a selfish choice."

They had reached the edge of the diplomatic quarter now, where the buildings grew more imposing, more fortified. Security cameras tracked their progress from discreet mountings.

"Is that why you do what you do?" Roxana asked. "Your work?"

Max looked at her sharply, but her expression was guileless. She thought he was an art dealer, nothing more. "What do you mean?"

"You have the look of someone trying to make up for something. Trying to balance scales that can't be balanced." She stopped walking, turning to face him fully. They were standing beneath a streetlamp, its light creating a small pool of illumination in the darkness. "I recognize it because I see it in the mirror every morning."

"What are you trying to make up for?"

"Choosing safety over freedom. Choosing comfort over truth." She looked away, toward the direction of her building, still two blocks distant. "Choosing to be a beautiful object in someone else's collection instead of a person living her own life."

"It's not too late," Max said, and meant it. "You could leave."

Roxana laughed, but there was no humor in it. "Could I? Do you know what Viktor is, Max? Really?"

The question hung between them, dangerous and loaded. Max kept his expression carefully neutral. "He's a diplomat."

"He's a spider at the center of a web," she said softly. "And I'm caught in it as surely as anyone else. Maybe more so, because I walked into it willingly. I saw the web, saw the spider, and thought I could navigate it. Thought I was clever enough to maintain some piece of myself." She met his eyes. "I was wrong."

A car passed, its headlights sweeping over them before disappearing around a corner. In the renewed darkness, Roxana seemed smaller, more fragile.

"There's always a choice," Max said.

"Is there?" She studied his face with an intensity that made him feel exposed. "What if the choice is between a cage and a grave? What if leaving means putting everyone you care about in danger? What if the spider's web extends further than you can run?"

Max wanted to tell her the truth then—that he could help her, that there were resources, protection, a way out. But Sabine's warning echoed in his mind: *Don't let emotions compromise the mission.*

Instead, he said, "Then you find someone who can help you cut the web."

Roxana was quiet for a long moment, her hand still resting on his arm. When she spoke again

**Scene 6: Outside Roxana's building, she ...**

**Scene 6: Outside Roxana's building, she stops and kisses Max for the first time**

The night air had turned sharp, carrying the scent of approaching rain across Vienna's diplomatic quarter. Max walked beside Roxana in silence, their footsteps echoing off the elegant facades of nineteenth-century buildings. The streetlamps cast pools of amber light at regular intervals, leaving shadows between them where the darkness felt almost intimate.

Roxana had been quiet since they'd left the gallery, her arms wrapped around herself despite the cashmere wrap draped over her shoulders. Max could still see Viktor's face in his mind—that cold smile, the proprietary hand on Roxana's lower back, the way he'd interrupted her mid-sentence to correct something trivial about an artist's technique.

"Thank you," Roxana said suddenly, her voice barely above a whisper.

"For what?"

"For seeing me tonight. Not just looking, the way everyone else does. Seeing."

Max's throat tightened. He should say something casual, something that would maintain the careful distance he'd already destroyed. Instead, he said nothing.

They reached the entrance to her building—a converted palace with iron gates and security cameras that Max had already catalogued during his reconnaissance. The windows on the third floor were dark. Viktor was still at the gallery, holding court with a Russian trade delegation.

Roxana turned to face him, and the lamplight caught the gold flecks in her eyes. She was trembling slightly, though whether from cold or something else, Max couldn't tell.

"I should go inside," she said, not moving.

"Yes."

"Viktor will be home soon."

"I know."

She stepped closer, and Max could smell her perfume—something subtle and expensive that he'd noticed the first day in the museum. Jasmine and amber. His training screamed at him to step back, to make an excuse, to preserve the operational integrity that was already compromised beyond repair.

He didn't move.

Roxana's hand came up to his chest, fingers spreading across the fabric of his shirt. He could feel his heartbeat accelerating beneath her palm, betraying him.

"Tell me to go," she whispered.

The professional response formed in his mind—*It's late, you should get some rest*—but the words died unspoken. Instead, he reached up and covered her hand with his own.

She rose onto her toes and kissed him.

It wasn't tentative or exploratory. It was desperate, hungry, the kind of kiss that carried weeks of loneliness and longing. Her free hand tangled in his hair, pulling him closer, and Max felt something inside him break loose—some carefully maintained barrier between the operative and the man.

He kissed her back with an intensity that surprised them both, his arms wrapping around her waist, pulling her against him. She made a small sound in the back of her throat, and it sent electricity down his spine. The world narrowed to the taste of her lips, the warmth of her body, the way she fit perfectly against him.

Somewhere in the distance, a car door slammed.

Roxana jerked back, breathing hard. Her eyes were wide, pupils dilated, and Max could see the pulse hammering in her throat. She looked terrified and exhilarated in equal measure, like someone who'd just jumped from a great height and discovered they could fly.

"I—" she started, then stopped.

Max's hands were still on her waist. He forced himself to release her, to step back, though every nerve in his body screamed against it.

"Roxana..."

"Don't," she said quickly, pressing her fingers to her lips as if she could still feel the kiss there. "Don't say anything. Not now."

She was already backing toward the entrance, her wrap slipping from one shoulder. The security camera above the door blinked its red eye at them—recording, documenting, creating evidence that could destroy them both.

"Tomorrow," she said. "The café near the Votivkirche. Two o'clock."

Before Max could respond, she turned and disappeared through the heavy glass doors. He watched her cross the marble lobby, moving quickly, not looking back. The elevator doors closed behind her, and she was gone.

Max stood alone on the empty street, his heart still racing, the taste of her still on his lips. Above him, the windows of the third floor remained dark. He touched his mouth, feeling the ghost of her kiss, and knew with absolute certainty that everything had changed.

His phone buzzed in his pocket. A text from Sabine: *Status report. 0800 tomorrow. Don't be late.*

Max stared at the message, then up at Roxana's building, then back at his phone. The rain began to fall, light drops at first, then heavier, soaking through his jacket. He should leave. Should go back to his apartment and write the report that would sanitize what had just happened into operational progress.

Instead, he stood in the rain and watched Roxana's windows until a light finally appeared on the third floor. Her silhouette moved across the curtains—pacing, he thought. Agitated. Unable to settle.

Just like him.

A black Mercedes turned onto the street, its headlights sweeping across Max's position. He recognized the diplomatic plates. Viktor, returning home.

Max turned and walked away, hands in his pockets, rain running down his face. Behind him, he heard the car pull up to the building, heard the door open and close. He didn't look back.

He'd crossed the line. There was no going back now.

The only question was how far he was willing to go forward.

## Chapter 5: The Affair

**Scene 1: Max and Roxana meet at the rent...**

# **Scene 1: Max and Roxana meet at the rented apartment for the first time**

The apartment smelled of old wood and lemon polish. Max had chosen it carefully—third floor of a converted townhouse in the Altstadt, the kind of building where neighbors minded their own business and the landlord accepted cash without asking questions. Afternoon light slanted through the gauze curtains, painting amber stripes across the hardwood floor.

He checked his watch. Two minutes past three.

The knock came soft but deliberate. Three taps, a pause, then two more. Their agreed signal, though Max wondered if such precautions were theatrical or necessary. In his line of work, the line between paranoia and prudence had long since blurred.

Roxana stood in the doorway wearing a charcoal coat buttoned to her throat, a silk scarf the color of winter sky draped loosely around her neck. Her dark hair was pinned up, exposing the elegant curve of her nape. She looked at him without speaking, her green eyes searching his face as if trying to read something written there in invisible ink.

"Come in," Max said, stepping aside.

She entered with measured steps, her gaze sweeping the sparse furnishings—a worn leather sofa, a small table with two chairs, a kitchenette barely large enough for one person. The bedroom door stood half-open beyond.

"It's not much," Max offered.

"It's perfect." Roxana turned to face him, and he saw the slight tremor in her hands as she unbuttoned her coat. "No one knows about this place?"

"No one."

She let the coat slip from her shoulders. Beneath it she wore a simple cream blouse and dark trousers that accentuated her slim figure. Max caught the scent of her perfume—something subtle, bergamot and jasmine—as she moved closer.

"I almost didn't come," she said quietly.

"Why did you?"

Roxana's lips curved into a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. "Because I'm tired of being careful. Tired of being what everyone expects." She reached up, pulled a pin from her hair. Dark waves tumbled down around her shoulders. "Because when I'm with you, I feel like I can breathe."

Max knew he should say something, maintain the careful distance that operational security demanded. Instead, he closed the space between them in two strides and cupped her face in his hands. Her skin was warm, impossibly soft. For a heartbeat they simply looked at each other, the weight of unspoken words hanging in the dusty afternoon light.

Then Roxana rose on her toes and kissed him.

The kiss was tentative at first, almost questioning. But when Max responded, something shifted. Her fingers found the back of his neck, pulling him closer with surprising urgency. He tasted wine on her lips, felt the rapid flutter of her pulse beneath his thumb. The careful control she'd maintained at every previous meeting fell away like a discarded mask.

They moved toward the bedroom without breaking apart, a graceless dance of stumbling steps and grasping hands. Max's jacket hit the floor. Roxana's blouse came unbuttoned with fumbling fingers—his, hers, he couldn't tell anymore. The bed was narrow, the sheets crisp and white, and when they fell onto it together the old frame creaked in protest.

What followed was intense, almost desperate. Roxana kissed like she was trying to erase something, her hands exploring with a hunger that matched his own. Max lost himself in the taste of her skin, the sound of her breathing, the way she whispered his name like a confession.

But afterward, as they lay tangled in the sheets with the afternoon light fading toward evening, Max noticed things he hadn't before. The way Roxana's fingers trembled slightly as she traced patterns on his chest. The hollow look that crept back into her eyes when she thought he wasn't watching. The tension that never quite left her shoulders, even in his arms.

"Are you all right?" he asked, brushing a strand of hair from her face.

Roxana was quiet for a long moment. When she finally spoke, her voice was barely above a whisper. "I haven't felt this way in years. Like I'm actually here, actually present in my own life." She turned to look at him, and he saw tears gathering at the corners of her eyes. "Is that strange?"

"No." Max pulled her closer, feeling the steady rhythm of her heartbeat against his ribs. "Not strange at all."

She nestled into him, her breath warm against his neck. "Viktor will be in Frankfurt until tomorrow night. I told my driver I was shopping and meeting a friend for dinner. We have a few hours."

A few hours. Max's mind automatically calculated—time to plant the first listening device, to steer the conversation toward Viktor's business dealings, to begin the careful process of recruitment. That was why he was here, after all. The mission. The objective.

But Roxana shifted in his arms, vulnerable and trusting, and something in Max's chest tightened uncomfortably.

"Then let's not waste them," he said, and meant it in ways that had nothing to do with tradecraft.

Roxana lifted her head, studying his face with those intelligent green eyes. For a moment Max had the unsettling sensation that she could see right through him, past the cover story and the careful lies, down to something he'd almost forgotten existed.

"Max," she said softly. "Whatever this is between us—I need you to know it's real for me. Not just an escape. Real."

The words hung in the air like a challenge and a confession all at once.

"It's real for me too," Max heard himself say, and realized with a cold shock that he meant it.

Roxana smiled then, a genuine smile that transformed her face, and kissed him again—slower this time, tender rather than desperate. Outside, church bells chimed the hour. The light continued to fade. And Max held her close, pushing away thoughts of surveillance equipment and mission parameters, choosing instead to exist in this moment, this lie that was becoming dangerously close to truth.

When they finally rose to dress, moving around each other with the careful intimacy of new lovers, Max caught sight of his reflection in the bedroom mirror. He looked the same as always—same face, same body, same practiced expressions.

But something fundamental had shifted, and he knew it.

Roxana finished buttoning her blouse and turned to him, her expression serious. "Can we meet again? Soon?"

"Yes," Max said without hesitation. "Whenever you can."

She nodded, then hesitated, her hand on the doorframe. "There are things I need to tell you. About Viktor. About what he's involved in." Her voice dropped lower. "I know more than I should. More than is safe."

Max's pulse quickened, but he kept his expression neutral. "You don't have to—"

"I want to," Roxana interrupted. "Not today. But soon. I think..." She paused, choosing her words carefully. "I think I've been waiting for someone I could trust. Someone who might understand."

She left before Max could respond, slipping out into the hallway with a final glance over her shoulder. Max listened to her footsteps descend the stairs, heard the building's front door open and close.

Then he was alone in the apartment, surrounded by afternoon shadows and the lingering scent of her perfume, wondering what the hell he'd just gotten himself into.

**Scene 2: During a quiet moment after th...**

**Scene 2: During a quiet moment after their encounter**

The afternoon light had shifted, turning amber as it filtered through the gauze curtains. Max lay on his back, one arm folded behind his head, listening to the sound of running water from the bathroom. Roxana's clothes were scattered across the hardwood floor like evidence at a crime scene—her silk blouse draped over the chair, her skirt pooled near the doorway.

Her handbag sat on the nightstand, black leather gleaming in the slanted sunlight.

Max's pulse quickened, but not from desire this time. He sat up slowly, the sheets rustling beneath him. The water continued to run. He had maybe two minutes.

The listening device was already in his palm—he'd kept it there since she'd gone into the bathroom, a small disc no larger than a shirt button, matte black and feather-light. His fingers found the magnetic clasp of her bag without fumbling. Professional muscle memory. The interior smelled of expensive perfume and leather. He felt past her phone, her wallet, located the zippered pocket in the silk lining.

The device slipped in easily. His fingers withdrew. The clasp clicked shut.

The water stopped.

Max was back against the headboard by the time the bathroom door opened, his breathing steady, his expression carefully arranged into something between contentment and drowsiness. Roxana emerged wrapped in one of the apartment's white towels, her dark hair damp against her shoulders. Without makeup, she looked younger. Vulnerable.

The guilt hit him like a fist to the sternum.

"You're still awake," she said, a small smile playing at her lips. "I thought you'd fallen asleep."

"Just thinking."

"Dangerous habit." She crossed to the window, adjusted the curtain slightly. A habit, Max had noticed—she was always aware of sightlines, of who might see in. "What about?"

"You," he said. It wasn't entirely a lie.

Roxana turned, and for a moment something flickered across her face—pleasure mixed with something harder to name. Sadness, maybe. Or recognition. She moved to the bed, sat on the edge, the mattress dipping beneath her weight.

"Max." Her voice was quiet. "We should talk about what this is."

His chest tightened. "What do you want it to be?"

"I don't know." She traced a pattern on the sheet between them, not meeting his eyes. "I just know that when I'm here, I can breathe. When I'm home..." She trailed off.

This was his opening. Max knew it instinctively, the way a predator knows when prey has exposed its throat. He reached out, covered her hand with his. "Has something happened? You seem more tense than usual."

"Viktor's been different lately." The words came slowly, as if she were testing their weight. "More secretive. He's always on his phone, always having these meetings at odd hours."

"Business?" Max kept his voice neutral, sympathetic.

"Maybe." Roxana's fingers curled into the sheet. "I don't know what kind of business requires meeting people at midnight in parking garages."

Max's heart rate spiked, but he kept his expression concerned, nothing more. "That does sound strange."

She looked at him then, really looked at him, and Max felt suddenly exposed, as if she could see straight through his carefully constructed cover to the operative beneath. Her eyes were the color of slate, and just as hard.

"You're easy to talk to," she said. "Has anyone ever told you that?"

"Once or twice."

"It's because you listen without judging. Or maybe..." She paused, her gaze sharpening. "Maybe because you're actually interested in what I have to say. Not just waiting for your turn to talk."

The observation was uncomfortably astute. Max shifted, aware of the listening device in her bag, aware of the surveillance camera hidden in the smoke detector above them, aware of the entire architecture of deception he'd built around this woman.

"I am interested," he said. And God help him, it was true.

Roxana stood abruptly, moving back to her scattered clothes. She began dressing with quick, efficient movements. "I should go. Viktor will be back from Moscow tonight."

"Roxana—"

"Don't." She pulled on her skirt, zipped it with a sharp sound. "Don't say whatever you're about to say. Not today."

Max watched her finish dressing, each garment a layer of armor going back on. When she reached for her handbag, his stomach clenched. She slung it over her shoulder without checking inside, thank God.

At the door, she paused. "Next week. Same time?"

"If you want to."

"I want to." She touched his face, her palm cool against his cheek. "You're a good man, Max Monroe. I hope that's not a lie."

Then she was gone, her footsteps fading down the stairs.

Max stood alone in the apartment, surrounded by the evidence of what they'd done—rumpled sheets, the lingering scent of her perfume, the ghost of her touch still warm on his skin. He thought about the device in her bag, already transmitting. He thought about the report he'd have to file, the intelligence he was gathering.

He thought about the look in her eyes when she'd said, *I hope that's not a lie.*

His phone buzzed. A text from Reeves: *Any progress?*

Max stared at the message for a long moment. Then he typed: *Working on it.*

He deleted three other versions before settling on those three words. They felt like a confession.

**Scene 3: Over wine in the apartment's s...**

**Scene 3: Over wine in the apartment's small kitchen**

The kitchen was barely large enough for two people to stand comfortably. Max leaned against the chipped porcelain sink while Roxana sat on the single wooden stool, her legs crossed, one bare foot swinging gently in the dim light. The bottle of Bordeaux between them was half-empty, though Max had drunk far less than he'd pretended to.

Rain drummed against the narrow window, blurring the amber glow of streetlights in the old quarter below. The apartment smelled of damp plaster and the lavender soap Roxana had brought on her second visit—small domestic touches that made the deception feel heavier in Max's chest.

She traced the rim of her glass with one finger, her eyes fixed on the dark red liquid. They'd been quiet for several minutes, the comfortable silence that comes after intimacy, but something had shifted in her posture. A tension in her shoulders that hadn't been there an hour ago.

"You've never asked me about Viktor's work," Roxana said suddenly.

Max kept his expression neutral, though his pulse quickened. "I assumed you didn't want to talk about him."

"Most men in your position would be curious." She looked up, her green eyes sharp despite the wine. "What does he do? How much money does he have? Whether he suspects anything."

"I'm not most men."

"No." A small smile played at her lips, but it didn't reach her eyes. "You're not, are you?"

She stood, moving past him to the window. This close, Max could smell her perfume mixed with the scent of rain. She pressed her palm against the glass, watching water streak down the other side.

"I found encrypted files on his computer three months ago," she said quietly. "I wasn't snooping. He left it open, and I saw them when I brought him coffee in his study."

Max said nothing. Every instinct screamed at him to guide this conversation carefully, but he sensed that any attempt at manipulation now would shatter whatever fragile trust existed between them.

"He meets with people I don't recognize," Roxana continued. "Russians, but not from our social circle. Men with hard faces who look at me like I'm furniture." She turned to face him. "And there's money. So much money that appears and disappears from accounts I'm not supposed to know about."

"Roxana—"

"I'm not stupid, Max." Her voice was steady, but her hand trembled slightly as she raised her glass. "I know my husband is involved in something illegal. I've known for months."

The rain grew louder, filling the silence between them. Max watched her carefully, recalibrating everything. She was more than intelligent—she was observant, strategic, and far more aware than he'd given her credit for.

"Why are you telling me this?" he asked.

She laughed, a short, bitter sound. "I don't know. Maybe because you're the first person in years who's looked at me like I'm more than Viktor Volkov's wife. Or maybe..." She paused, studying his face with an intensity that made him feel exposed. "Maybe because I want to see how you react."

"How I react?"

"Whether you'll try to use this information. Whether you'll ask me questions." She stepped closer, her eyes searching his. "Whether you're exactly who you say you are."

Max's mind raced. This was the opening he needed, the perfect opportunity to begin the recruitment process. But the way she was looking at him—wary, testing, vulnerable—made his carefully rehearsed approaches feel like violations.

"I don't want to use you, Roxana."

"Everyone uses everyone, Max. That's how the world works." She set down her glass with a soft click. "The question is whether you'll be honest about it."

Outside, a car horn blared in the narrow street. Someone shouted in French, the words lost in the rain. Roxana's phone buzzed on the counter—Viktor's name flashing on the screen. She glanced at it but didn't move to answer.

"I should go," she said, but she didn't move toward her coat.

Max reached out, his hand hovering near her arm but not quite touching. "If you're in danger—"

"I'm always in danger." She met his eyes. "The question is what kind, and from whom."

The phone stopped buzzing. In the sudden quiet, Max could hear his own heartbeat, feel the weight of decisions pressing down on him. He thought of the surveillance equipment hidden in the bedroom, the reports he'd file, the handlers waiting for exactly this breakthrough.

"I can help you," he said carefully. "If you want out."

Roxana's expression was unreadable. "Can you? Or would helping me just happen to serve some other purpose?"

She was testing him, and they both knew it. Every word from here mattered.

"Both things can be true," Max said finally.

For a long moment, Roxana didn't respond. Then she picked up her wine glass and drained it, her eyes never leaving his face.

"Next time we meet," she said, "we should talk about what 'help' means to you. And what it might cost me."

She moved past him toward the bedroom where her clothes lay scattered on the floor. Max stayed in the kitchen, listening to the soft sounds of her dressing, the rustle of fabric and the zip of her dress.

When she emerged, perfectly composed again, she paused in the doorway.

"The files on Viktor's computer," she said. "They're updated every Tuesday evening. He works late those nights." She pulled on her coat. "I thought you should know."

Then she was gone, the door clicking shut behind her, leaving Max alone with the rain and the half-empty bottle of wine and the terrible certainty that everything had just become far more complicated.

**Scene 4: Roxana breaks down and confesse...**

**Scene 4: Roxana breaks down and confesses her fear of Viktor**

The rain had started again, drumming against the tall windows of the apartment in a rhythm that seemed to match the pulse in Max's throat. Roxana sat curled into the corner of the leather couch, her legs tucked beneath her, wearing one of his shirts. The fabric swallowed her frame, making her look smaller, more fragile than he'd ever seen her.

She'd been quiet for the past twenty minutes, staring at the glass of wine in her hands without drinking. Max watched her from his position at the other end of the couch, noting the tension in her shoulders, the way her fingers trembled slightly against the stem.

"I can't do this anymore," she said finally, her voice barely audible above the rain.

Max's chest tightened. "Can't do what?"

"Any of it." She set the wine down on the side table with deliberate care, as if afraid it might shatter. "Pretending. Lying. Going home to him and..." She pressed her palms against her eyes. "God, I'm so tired of being afraid."

He moved closer, close enough to smell the jasmine of her perfume mixed with the scent of his own soap from her earlier shower. "Roxana—"

"Do you know what he told me the last time I mentioned divorce?" Her hands dropped, and her eyes met his—dark, glistening, rimmed with red. "He said if I ever tried to leave, I would never see my family again. Not my mother. Not my sister. Not the niece I haven't held since she was born."

The words hung in the air between them like smoke.

"He has connections in Moscow. Friends in the FSB, in the prosecutor's office. He showed me photographs once, of my mother's apartment building, my sister's workplace. He didn't have to say anything else. I understood." Her voice cracked. "He owns me, Max. Completely."

A cold fury ignited in Max's gut, spreading through his chest like frost. He'd encountered men like Viktor before—men who wielded power like a weapon, who understood that the most effective chains were the ones made of love and fear. But knowing it intellectually was different from seeing the damage up close, from watching tears slide down Roxana's cheeks.

"How long?" he asked quietly.

"Three years. Since we moved here." She laughed, a bitter sound. "I thought London would be freedom. A fresh start. Instead, it's just a prettier cage."

Max reached for her hand. Her fingers were ice-cold despite the warmth of the room. "You're not powerless."

"Aren't I?" She looked at him with something like desperation. "What can I do? Run? He'd find me. Go to the police? And tell them what—that my husband made threats? They'd send me back to him within hours. You don't understand what kind of man Viktor is. The people he knows. The things he's capable of."

"Then tell me." Max kept his voice steady, gentle, even as his mind raced through calculations and possibilities. "Help me understand."

Roxana pulled her hand free and stood, pacing to the window. The rain-blurred city lights painted her profile in shades of amber and shadow. She wrapped her arms around herself, the shirt sleeves falling past her hands.

"I've seen things. Files on his computer—encrypted, but sometimes he leaves them open. Names. Numbers. Transfers to accounts in Cyprus, the Caymans. And the people who come to the house..." She shuddered. "Last month, there was a man. Russian, but trying to hide it. Viktor took him to his study, and when they came out, the man's knuckles were bleeding. Viktor just smiled and offered him brandy."

Max rose and moved behind her, careful not to touch her yet, giving her space. "What else?"

"Phone calls in the middle of the night. Trips he won't explain. Money appearing and disappearing." She turned to face him, and the fear in her eyes was raw, primal. "I'm not stupid, Max. I know he's involved in something illegal. Something dangerous. And I'm terrified that one day, whatever he's doing will come crashing down, and I'll be buried in the rubble."

"You won't be." The words came out harder than he intended, edged with a protectiveness that went beyond his cover, beyond the mission. He reached for her, and this time she came willingly, pressing her face against his chest.

Her shoulders shook with silent sobs. Max held her, one hand stroking her hair, the other pressed against her back. Through the thin cotton of his shirt, he could feel her heart racing.

This was the moment. The opening he'd been working toward. All he had to do was suggest an alternative, plant the seed that there might be a way out—for her, for her family. That he could help her, protect her, if she helped him first.

The words formed in his mind, practiced and precise. But as Roxana's tears soaked through his shirt, as her fingers clutched at him like he was the only solid thing in a dissolving world, something in his chest twisted painfully.

"I won't let him hurt you," he heard himself say instead. "I promise."

She looked up at him, mascara smudged beneath her eyes, hope and disbelief warring in her expression. "How can you promise that? You don't know him. You don't know what he's capable of."

*But I do,* Max thought. *Better than you realize.*

"Trust me," he said, tilting her chin up with his fingers. "Please."

Roxana searched his face for a long moment. Then she rose on her toes and kissed him—not with passion this time, but with something deeper. Gratitude. Desperation. Faith.

When she pulled back, she whispered, "I want to help. Whatever you need to know about Viktor, I'll tell you. I'll show you. Just... promise you'll get me out of this."

Max's blood ran cold even as he nodded. She knew. Somehow, she'd figured out that this wasn't just an affair, that he wanted information. And instead of running, she was offering herself as an asset.

It should have been a victory. Instead, it felt like the walls were closing in.

"We'll figure it out together," he said, the lie tasting like ashes on his tongue. "I promise."

Outside, the rain intensified, hammering against the windows like it was trying to break through.

**Scene 5: Max returns to his own apartme...**

**Scene 5: Max returns to his own apartment alone and reports to his handler**

The rain had started again by the time Max reached his apartment, a relentless percussion against the windows that matched the rhythm of his pulse. He stood in the dark for a long moment, jacket dripping onto the hardwood floor, letting his eyes adjust to the shadows. The place felt hollow after Roxana's warmth—just another safe house dressed up with impersonal furniture and a refrigerator that hummed too loudly in the silence.

Her scent still clung to his clothes. Jasmine and something else, something uniquely her.

Max stripped off the wet jacket and tossed it over a chair, then moved to the kitchen. His hands were steady as he poured two fingers of whiskey into a glass, but he noticed the slight tremor when he raised it to his lips. The burn down his throat did nothing to settle the knot in his chest.

The encrypted phone sat on the counter like an accusation.

He had forty minutes before the scheduled check-in. Forty minutes to compartmentalize, to become the operative again instead of the man who'd held Roxana in the darkness of that rented apartment while she'd confessed her fears. The man who'd kissed her temple and promised her she wasn't alone, knowing it was a lie wrapped in tradecraft.

*Encrypted files. Unknown contacts. Viktor threatening her family.*

It was everything the agency needed. Everything *he* needed to justify the last three months of careful manipulation. Roxana had just handed him the keys to Viktor Orlov's inner circle, and all Max felt was the weight of what came next.

He drained the whiskey and poured another.

At precisely 11:47 PM, Max activated the phone. The screen glowed pale blue in the darkness. He entered the authentication code, waited through the connection protocols, and heard the familiar click of the secure line engaging.

"Nightingale." His handler's voice was crisp, businesslike. No names, never names. Just the operational designation Max had carried for six years.

"Checking in." Max kept his tone neutral, professional. He moved to the window, watching rain streak down the glass in silver rivulets.

"Status?"

"Progress. The asset has revealed knowledge of the target's activities." Max chose his words carefully, each one a small betrayal. "She's discovered encrypted files on his personal computer. She's also observed meetings with unidentified individuals."

A pause. Max could hear the faint scratch of pen on paper—his handler still took notes by hand during sensitive calls, a quirk from the Cold War days.

"Has she accessed the files?"

"No. They're encrypted. She doesn't have the technical knowledge."

"But she's curious." It wasn't a question.

"She's frightened." Max watched his reflection in the window, a ghost superimposed over the city lights. "The target has made threats. If she attempts to leave, he'll use his connections to ensure she never sees her family in Russia again."

"Leverage." His handler's voice carried a note of satisfaction that made Max's jaw tighten. "That's excellent. Fear and isolation—she's perfectly positioned for recruitment."

Max said nothing. Outside, a car passed below, headlights cutting through the rain.

"Nightingale? You copy?"

"I copy."

"Then you know what needs to happen next. Recruit her. Tonight's revelations indicate she's ready. She's already halfway there—she wants out, she wants protection. Give her both. Make her an asset."

Max closed his eyes. He could still feel Roxana's fingers tracing patterns on his chest, her voice soft in the darkness: *I know something's wrong. I know Viktor is dangerous. But I don't know what to do.*

"It's too soon," Max heard himself say. "She's vulnerable, yes, but not committed. If we push now, we risk losing her entirely. She could panic, could tell Viktor—"

"She won't." His handler's certainty was absolute. "You've done your job well. She trusts you. She's emotionally invested. Use that."

The words landed like stones in Max's stomach. *Use that.* Use her trust. Use her fear. Use the intimacy they'd built, the confessions she'd whispered against his skin.

"I need more time," Max said, and hated the edge of desperation that crept into his voice. "Another week, maybe two. Let me solidify the relationship, make sure she's truly committed before we—"

"We don't have two weeks." His handler's tone sharpened. "Intelligence indicates Viktor is planning something significant. We need eyes inside his operation now, not when it's convenient for your timeline. Roxana Orlova is our best chance at penetrating his network, and you've just confirmed she has access and motivation. What's the problem?"

Max's free hand curled into a fist against the window frame. Rain hammered against the glass.

"There's no problem."

"Then why the hesitation?" A pause, weighted with implication. "You're not getting emotionally compromised, are you, Nightingale?"

The question hung in the air like smoke. Max forced himself to breathe slowly, to keep his voice level.

"No."

"Good. Because you know what happens when an operative loses objectivity. You know how that ends." His handler let the threat settle. "Roxana Orlova is not a person. She's an asset. A tool. The moment you forget that is the moment you become a liability."

Max stared at his reflection—the stranger in the glass with his face.

"I understand."

"Do you?" His handler's voice softened slightly, almost paternal. "Look, I know this part is never easy. You've spent months building rapport, creating intimacy. It feels real. But it's not. It's theater. You're playing a role, and so is she, whether she knows it or not. Don't confuse the performance with reality."

*She'd cried in his arms. Real tears, real fear.*

"When do you want the recruitment to happen?" Max asked.

"Next meeting. Lay the groundwork tonight if possible—a text, something to make her feel seen, protected. Then at your next encounter, make the pitch. Offer her a way out. Protection for her cooperation. We'll provide the details, the assurances. Your job is to sell it."

"Understood."

"One more thing." His handler's voice dropped. "If she refuses, if she shows any indication she might expose you or the operation, you know the protocols."

Max's blood went cold. The protocols. Sanitize the operation. Eliminate the risk.

"That won't be necessary."

"Let's hope not. But be prepared for all contingencies. Viktor Orlov doesn't tolerate betrayal, and neither do we." A pause. "Report again in forty-eight hours. And Nightingale? Don't let me down on this. We've invested too much to have it fall apart because of sentiment."

The line went dead.

Max stood in the darkness, phone still pressed to his ear, listening to the silence. Outside, the rain continued its assault on the city, washing everything clean and leaving it just as dirty as before.

He set the phone down carefully, precisely, as if it might shatter. Then he returned to the whiskey bottle and poured again, this time not bothering with the glass. The burn was sharper straight from the bottle, more honest.

His phone—his personal phone—buzzed on the counter. A text message.

*Thank you for tonight. For listening. For making me feel less alone. —E*

Max stared at the words until they blurred. His thumb hovered over the keyboard. The professional response was already forming: something warm, something that deepened her dependence, that positioned him as her only refuge.

*Use that.*

He typed: *You're not alone. I promise. Sleep well.*

Hit send.

Then he walked to the bathroom and braced his hands on the sink, staring at his reflection in the mirror. The man looking back had done this before—had recruited assets, had exploited vulnerabilities, had traded in human desperation for intelligence gains. That man had never hesitated.

But that man had never felt like this.

Max splashed cold water on his face, let it drip down his neck. When he looked up again, his expression had hardened into something familiar. The mask was back in place.

He had a job to do. Roxana Orlova was an asset, a means to an end. In forty-eight hours, he would recruit her. He would offer her hope and protection, and in exchange, she would give him everything: access to Viktor's files, his contacts, his secrets. She would become a spy without even realizing the full extent of what she'd agreed to.

And if it went wrong, if she refused or panicked or threatened to expose him...

Max closed his eyes against that thought.

The

**Scene 6: Max and Roxana meet again at th...**

**Scene 6: Max and Roxana meet again at the apartment three days later**

The afternoon light filtered through the gauze curtains, casting pale shadows across the bedroom's worn wooden floor. Max lay on his back, one arm draped across his eyes, listening to the rhythm of Roxana's breathing beside him. The sheets were tangled around their legs, still warm from their bodies.

Three days since their last meeting. Three days of Max rehearsing this moment, constructing the approach, calibrating the pitch. Now that it was here, the words felt like stones in his throat.

Roxana shifted, her fingertips tracing idle patterns on his chest. Her touch was lighter than usual, distracted. Through the thin walls came the muffled sounds of the old quarter—a motorcycle accelerating, someone shouting in rapid-fire Portuguese, the distant clatter of dishes from a restaurant kitchen.

"You're quiet today," she said.

Max lowered his arm and turned to face her. Her dark hair spilled across the pillow, and her eyes—those remarkable gray eyes—studied him with an intensity that made his carefully constructed walls feel transparent.

"Just thinking," he said.

"About?"

He reached out, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. The gesture was automatic now, intimate in a way that had nothing to do with the mission. That was the problem.

"About what you told me," he said carefully. "About the files. The meetings."

Roxana's hand stilled on his chest. "I shouldn't have said anything."

"I'm glad you did." Max sat up slowly, the sheet falling to his waist. He needed the physical distance to do this properly. "Roxana, you said you feel powerless. That you can't leave."

"I can't." Her voice was flat, matter-of-fact. She remained on her back, staring at the ceiling. "You don't know Viktor. What he's capable of."

"Then maybe you need leverage of your own."

The words hung in the air between them. Max watched her profile, the way her jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. Outside, a church bell began to toll the hour—slow, resonant peals that seemed to count down to something inevitable.

Roxana sat up abruptly, pulling the sheet around herself. She moved to the edge of the bed, her back to him, shoulders rigid beneath the thin cotton.

"Leverage," she repeated. The word sounded different in her accent, harder.

Max's training screamed at him to press forward, to exploit the opening. Instead, he found himself reaching for her shoulder, the touch gentle, almost apologetic.

"Information," he said quietly. "About what he's doing. Who he's meeting. It would protect you. Give you options."

She turned then, and the look in her eyes made his breath catch. Not anger—he could have handled anger. This was something else. Recognition. Understanding. The expression of someone who had just confirmed a suspicion.

"Was this your plan all along, Max?"

Her voice was steady, but he heard the tremor beneath it. Not fear. Something closer to disappointment, or perhaps resignation.

"Roxana—"

"The way we met. Too convenient, yes?" She stood, wrapping the sheet more tightly around herself, and moved to the window. The afternoon light illuminated her profile, the elegant line of her neck, the slight furrow between her brows. "A handsome American. So interested in me. So easy to talk to."

Max rose from the bed, pulling on his pants. His mouth was dry. "It's not like that."

"No?" She glanced back at him, and her expression was unreadable. "Then tell me. What is it like?"

He crossed to her, stopping just short of touching distance. Close enough to see the pulse beating at her throat, the way her fingers gripped the windowsill.

"It started as a job," he said. The truth felt dangerous in his mouth, but lies felt worse. "But that's not what it is now."

"A job." She turned to face him fully. "And what is the job, exactly? What do you want from me?"

The question was direct, unflinching. Max had been trained for this—for recruitment pitches, for turning assets, for the delicate dance of manipulation and persuasion. But standing here, watching the way the light caught in her eyes, he found all his training insufficient.

"I work for people who want to know what Viktor is involved in," he said. "People who could help you, if you help them."

"Americans."

It wasn't a question, but he nodded anyway.

Roxana was silent for a long moment, her gaze searching his face. The church bells had stopped, leaving only the ambient noise of the street below. Somewhere in the building, water ran through old pipes.

"And if I say no?" she asked finally. "If I walk out of here right now?"

Max's chest tightened. "Then you walk out. I won't stop you."

"But you'll find someone else. Another way to get to Viktor."

"Probably."

She laughed—a short, bitter sound. "At least you're honest about that."

She moved past him, gathering her clothes from where they lay scattered across the floor. Max watched her dress with practiced efficiency, each movement precise and controlled. He should say something, he knew. Make the pitch properly. Offer assurances, guarantees, whatever it took to secure her cooperation.

But the words wouldn't come.

Roxana buttoned her blouse, then paused, her hands stilling on the fabric. When she looked up at him, her expression had shifted into something he couldn't quite read—calculation mixed with something softer, more vulnerable.

"These people you work for," she said. "They could really help me? Get me away from him?"

"Yes." Max stepped closer. "But it would be dangerous. If Viktor found out—"

"Everything is dangerous," she interrupted. "Staying is dangerous. Leaving is dangerous. At least this way..." She trailed off, looking down at her hands.

"At least this way, you have some control," Max finished.

She met his eyes again, and he saw the fear there, carefully masked but present. Also something else—determination, perhaps. Or desperation.

"I need to think," she said.

"Of course."

She collected her purse, checked her phone. The mundane gestures of someone preparing to return to their regular life, to the performance of normalcy. At the door, she paused with her hand on the knob.

"Max?"

"Yes?"

"If I do this..." She turned to face him one last time. "If I help you—I need to know it wasn't all lies. What we have here."

The question hung between them, demanding honesty he wasn't sure he could give. Because what did they have? An affair built on deception, sustained by mutual need and dangerous chemistry. And yet, standing here in the fading afternoon light, Max knew his feelings had become something he couldn't fully control or define.

"It's not all lies," he said quietly.

Roxana held his gaze for three heartbeats, then nodded once, sharply. "I'll call you."

Then she was gone, the door clicking shut behind her, leaving Max alone in the apartment with the ghost of her perfume and the weight of what he'd just set in motion.

He moved to the window, watching until he saw her emerge onto the street below. She didn't look back, didn't hesitate, just walked away with her shoulders straight and her head high. Disappearing into the flow of pedestrians, returning to her gilded cage.

Max's phone buzzed. A text from Reeves: *Status?*

He stared at it for a long moment before typing back: *In progress.*

Outside, the city continued its afternoon rhythm, indifferent to the small betrayals and dangerous bargains being made in its hidden corners. Max poured himself a drink from the bottle he kept in the kitchen, then returned to the window.

He had done what he came to do. Planted the seed. Made the pitch. Now it was just a matter of waiting to see if Roxana would choose survival over loyalty, freedom over fear.

The whiskey burned going down, but it didn't wash away the taste of guilt.

Or the memory of her eyes, asking if it had all been lies.

## Chapter 6: The Proposal

**Scene 1: Max arranges to meet Roxana at ...**

**Scene 1: Max arranges to meet Roxana at their usual café**

The afternoon light slanted through the café's tall windows, casting amber streaks across the worn wooden tables. Max sat in their usual corner, the one Roxana had laughingly claimed as "theirs" three weeks ago, and watched the steam curl up from his untouched espresso. His hand rested on the table, steady despite the adrenaline coursing through his veins. He'd rehearsed this moment a hundred times, run through every possible reaction, every contingency. None of it made his chest feel any less tight.

The bell above the door chimed.

Roxana entered like a breath of spring in the fading autumn, her cream-colored coat unbuttoned, a silk scarf the color of champagne draped loosely around her neck. She spotted him immediately, and that smile—the one that had become both his weakness and his weapon—transformed her face. Max felt something twist inside him, sharp and unwelcome.

*This is the job. Just the job.*

But he'd stopped believing that lie days ago.

"You look serious," Roxana said as she slid into the chair across from him, her accent wrapping around the words like velvet. She reached for his hand, her fingers cool and delicate. "What's wrong?"

Max didn't pull away. Not yet. He memorized the feeling of her touch, knowing it might be the last time she'd offer it willingly.

"I need to talk to you about something." His voice came out rougher than intended.

Her smile faltered. "That sounds ominous."

"Roxana." He turned his hand over, clasping hers properly. "What I'm about to tell you—I need you to listen. All the way through. Can you do that?"

The warmth drained from her eyes, replaced by something wary. She withdrew her hand slowly, folding both in her lap. "You're scaring me."

"I'm not an art dealer."

The words hung between them like smoke. Roxana's face went very still, that practiced stillness he'd seen her use with Viktor's associates. The mask she wore when she needed to survive.

"What?"

"I work for people who are very interested in your husband's business activities. The real ones. Not the legitimate import-export operations, but what happens in the warehouses after dark. The containers that don't appear on any manifest."

Roxana's lips parted, but no sound came out. The color had leached from her cheeks, leaving two spots of rouge standing out like wounds.

Max pressed forward, knowing that hesitation now would doom them both. "I was sent here to get close to you. To use you to get to Viktor. That's the truth."

"Get out." Her voice was barely a whisper.

"Roxana—"

"Get out!" The words cracked like a whip. Heads turned at nearby tables. Roxana's hands trembled as she gripped the edge of the table, her knuckles white. "You—all of this—every conversation, every—" She couldn't finish, her breath coming in short, sharp gasps.

Max leaned forward, keeping his voice low and urgent. "That's how it started. That was the mission. But it's not—Roxana, look at me."

She did, and the betrayal in her eyes nearly broke him.

"It's not what it became," he said. "I need you to understand that. What's between us, what we have—that wasn't part of any plan. That was never supposed to happen."

"How convenient." Her laugh was bitter, brittle. "The spy develops real feelings for his mark. Do they teach you that line in training?"

"I can help you escape him."

That stopped her. Roxana's jaw tightened, and for a moment, she looked like she might slap him. Instead, she grabbed her purse, preparing to stand.

"In exchange for what?" The question came out sharp, surgical. "Because men like you don't offer help for free. Viktor taught me that much."

Max pulled a photograph from his jacket pocket and placed it face-down on the table between them. "I need proof. Documents. Evidence of what Viktor is really moving through those ports. Things only you can access."

"You're insane." But she didn't stand. Didn't leave. Her eyes fixed on the photograph like it was a snake that might strike.

"Turn it over," Max said quietly.

Roxana's hand shook as she reached for it. When she flipped it, her breath caught. The image showed a warehouse in Hamburg, bodies on the floor, young women's faces frozen in terror and death. The metadata stamp in the corner was dated three months ago.

"This is one of Viktor's operations that went wrong," Max said. "Twenty-three women from Moldova and Ukraine, promised jobs as au pairs in Germany. They're all dead now because the container's refrigeration failed and no one checked on them for four days."

Roxana's fingers crumpled the edge of the photo. "Stop."

"There are more. There will always be more, unless someone stops him."

"And you think I—what? That I'll betray my husband for you? For some stranger who's been lying to me since the moment we met?" But her voice cracked on the last word, and tears gathered at the corners of her eyes.

Max reached across the table, stopping just short of touching her. "I think you'll do it because you know what he is. Because you've known for a long time and you've been looking for a way out. I'm offering you that way."

"By making me a traitor."

"By making you free."

The silence stretched between them, thick with everything unsaid. Outside, Vienna moved through its late afternoon rhythms—tourists photographing baroque architecture, businessmen hurrying to appointments, lovers strolling hand-in-hand through streets that had witnessed centuries of secrets and betrayals.

Roxana's voice, when it came, was hollow. "What exactly are you proposing?"

Max felt his pulse quicken. She hadn't walked away. That was something. Maybe everything.

"You help me access Viktor's safe. Get me copies of his shipping manifests, his financial records, his contact lists. Everything that proves what he's doing. In exchange, I guarantee you a new identity, money, and safe passage to anywhere in the world you want to go. You disappear. Viktor will never find you."

"You can't promise that."

"I can. And I will."

Roxana stared at him, and he watched her mind work behind those dark eyes—calculating, measuring, weighing the cost of trust against the price of staying.

"I need to think," she said finally, standing abruptly. The chair scraped against the floor with a sound like a scream.

"Roxana—"

"Don't." She held up a hand, stopping him. "Don't say my name. Don't tell me again that your feelings are real. Don't make this worse than it already is."

She turned to leave, then paused, looking back over her shoulder. The afternoon light caught her profile, and Max saw both the woman he'd come to care for and the frightened girl trapped in a gilded cage.

"If I decide to help you," she said quietly, "it won't be because I believe you. It will be because I have no other choice."

Then she was gone, the bell above the door chiming her exit like a funeral toll.

Max sat alone at their table, the photograph of the dead women face-up between the cooling espresso cups, and wondered if he'd just saved her or destroyed the only real thing he'd felt in years.

His phone buzzed. A text from his handler: *Status?*

Max stared at it for a long moment, then typed: *In progress.*

He didn't mention that his hands were shaking, or that he'd just broken the cardinal rule of his profession. He didn't mention that somewhere in the last three weeks, Roxana Volkov had stopped being an asset and become something far more dangerous.

She'd become someone he couldn't afford to lose.

**Scene 2: Roxana stands to leave, but Max...**

Roxana's chair scraped against the hardwood floor with a finality that made Max's chest constrict. She was already reaching for her coat, her movements sharp and precise, the way people moved when they were trying not to fall apart.

"Roxana, please—"

"Don't." Her voice cut like a blade. "Don't say my name like that. Like you know me."

Max stood, his hand instinctively reaching across the table before he caught himself. The bistro hummed around them—the clink of silverware, murmured conversations, the hiss of the espresso machine—but it all felt distant, underwater. Everything depended on the next sixty seconds.

"You're right," he said, keeping his voice low and steady. "The approach was calculated. The gallery, the conversation about Rothko, the coffee—all of it was planned." He watched her fingers pause on her coat button. "But that was three weeks ago, Roxana. What happened after... what's happening now... I didn't plan for this."

She turned, and the look in her eyes nearly broke him. Not anger—he could have handled anger. It was the hurt, raw and exposed, mixed with something that looked dangerously close to hope. That hope terrified him more than Viktor's entire organization.

"You're a liar," she said, but her voice wavered. "How am I supposed to believe anything you say?"

Max pulled out his wallet, extracted a worn photograph, and placed it on the table between them. A young woman, blonde, smiling at a beach somewhere. "Her name was Sabine. My partner. We were running surveillance on a trafficking ring in Prague two years ago. She got made because I missed a detail—one detail." He swallowed hard. "They found her in the Vltava River three days later."

Roxana's hand moved toward the photograph but didn't touch it.

"I stopped feeling things after that," Max continued. "Became good at my job because I didn't care about anything except the mission. Then I met you." He looked directly at her, letting her see everything he'd been hiding. "And for the first time in two years, I felt something other than guilt and rage. You made me remember what it was like to be human."

"Stop it." But she didn't move toward the door.

"I know about Viktor." Max's voice dropped further. "Not the art collector, not the philanthropist. The real Viktor Volkov. The one who moves girls from Eastern Europe through a network of 'modeling agencies.' The one who has judges and police commissioners on his payroll. The one who killed a sixteen-year-old Ukrainian girl last month because she tried to run."

Roxana's face went pale. She sank back into her chair, her coat forgotten.

"Her name was Oksana," Max said quietly. "She looked like you, actually. Same dark hair, same—" He stopped himself. "I'm sorry. But you need to know what you're living with. What you're part of, whether you want to be or not."

"I'm not part of anything." The words came out barely above a whisper.

"I know." Max leaned forward. "That's why I'm here. That's why I'm breaking every protocol, risking my career, probably my life, to have this conversation. Because I know you're not like him. I've watched you, Roxana. Not just as surveillance—I've *seen* you. The way you volunteer at that shelter on Tuesdays. How you sneak food to the homeless man outside your building. The books you read when you think no one's watching—Plath, Akhmatova, Szymborska. Women who understood what it meant to be trapped."

A tear slid down her cheek. She wiped it away angrily. "What do you want from me?"

"Viktor has a safe in his study. Private, separate from the main security system. He keeps documents there—evidence of transactions, names, locations. Things he can't digitize because they're too damning." Max paused, watching her carefully. "You're the only person besides Viktor who knows the combination. I've seen you go in there when he's away. Tuesdays and Thursdays, when he meets with Dmitri Kozlov."

Roxana's breath caught. "You've been watching me in the house?"

"No. Never inside. I would never—" Max ran a hand through his hair, frustrated. "There's a camera in the oak tree across the street. Building security. I accessed the feeds."

"Jesus Christ." She laughed, but it was a broken sound. "This is insane. You're insane. I'm insane for still sitting here."

"Probably." Max allowed himself a small, sad smile. "But you're still sitting here."

She met his eyes, and something passed between them—recognition, maybe, or resignation. "Even if I wanted to help you, which I'm not saying I do, Viktor would know. He knows everything. He has people everywhere."

"Not everywhere." Max pulled a folded paper from his jacket pocket and slid it across the table. "That's a new identity. Canadian passport, birth certificate, credit history going back fifteen years. There's a cottage in Nova Scotia, paid in full, under that name. Bank account with enough money to last you five years if you're careful, longer if you invest wisely."

Roxana stared at the paper without touching it. "You made this before you even talked to me today."

"Yes."

"So you knew. You knew I'd say yes."

"No." Max's voice was firm. "I *hoped* you'd say yes. There's a difference. If you walk out that door right now, that identity is still yours. Whether you help me or not, whether you run or stay, it exists. It's real. Your escape route is real, Roxana. I'm giving it to you regardless."

She finally picked up the paper, unfolded it with trembling fingers. The photograph showed her face, but the name read "Claire Morrison." The details were meticulous—birthplace, education history, employment records.

"Why?" she asked. "Why would you do this if you don't know I'll help you?"

Max leaned back, suddenly exhausted. Outside the window, snow had begun to fall, dusting the Cambridge street in white. "Because three weeks ago, I watched you stand in front of a Kandinsky at the MFA for twenty minutes. You were crying. Not obviously—just tears running down your face while you stared at all that color and chaos. And I realized that you were trapped in a life you never chose, with a man you never loved, in a cage made of money and fear." He paused. "I know what that feels like. To be trapped. And I decided right then that even if you couldn't help me, even if this whole operation went to hell, I was going to make sure you had a way out."

Roxana's hands shook as she refolded the paper. When she looked up, her eyes were bright with unshed tears, but her voice was steady. "If I do this—and I'm not saying I will—but if I do, what happens to Viktor?"

"He goes to prison. Federal charges, international trafficking, racketeering, murder. He'll die behind bars."

"Good." The word came out hard and cold, and Max saw something shift in her expression. A decision being made in real-time. "He killed Oksana, you said?"

"Yes."

"Tell me about her."

So Max did. He told her about the sixteen-year-old from Lviv who'd been promised a modeling contract in New York. About how she'd ended up in a basement in Southie instead, servicing men who paid Viktor's organization for the privilege. About how she'd managed to get a message to a friend back home, who'd contacted the Ukrainian embassy, who'd alerted the FBI. About how she'd been found in a dumpster behind a restaurant in Dorchester two days before they could extract her, her neck broken, her body showing signs of prolonged abuse.

By the time he finished, Roxana's face was stone.

"I want to see the file," she said. "Everything you have on him. Every victim, every transaction, every piece of evidence. I want to know exactly what I'm helping to stop."

"Roxana—"

"That's my condition. If you want my help, I need to see it all. I need to know that this is worth it. That I'm not just trading one prison for another, one set of lies for a different set."

Max nodded slowly. "Okay. I can arrange that. But it won't be easy to look at."

"Nothing about my life has been easy." She stood again, but this time her movements were deliberate, controlled. "I need time to think. Two days. Don't contact me, don't follow me, don't send any more

**Scene 3: Two days pass with no contact ...**

**Scene 3: Two days pass with no contact from Roxana**

The apartment walls were closing in.

Max stood at the window of his safe house for the third time in an hour, watching the street below where nothing moved except a stray cat picking through garbage bins. The coffee in his hand had gone cold again—he'd lost count of how many cups he'd abandoned throughout the apartment, ceramic monuments to his inability to focus on anything except the phone that refused to ring.

Forty-seven hours. Thirty-two minutes.

He'd stopped pretending he wasn't counting.

The phone sat on the kitchen counter where he could see it from every angle in the cramped space. The screen remained dark, mocking him with its silence. He'd checked it seventeen times in the last hour alone, confirming the volume was up, the battery charged, the signal strong. All functioning perfectly. All completely useless.

*She's gone to Viktor. She's telling him everything right now.*

Max pressed his forehead against the cool glass, watching his breath fog the window. The rational part of his brain—the part trained by a decade of fieldwork—insisted she would have run instead. Smart people didn't confront men like Viktor Volkov with accusations of criminality. They disappeared into the night and never looked back.

But the other part, the part that had emerged somewhere between the Kunsthistorisches Museum and that kiss in the rain, whispered something worse: that she'd simply vanished, slipped away from both Viktor and him, choosing neither monster nor liar but the uncertain freedom of being alone.

His phone buzzed.

Max's heart seized before he registered it was the wrong phone—the encrypted one in his jacket pocket. The handler. He considered not answering, letting it ring out into the void of his professional obligations. But old habits died hard.

"Monroe."

"Status update." Carter's voice carried the clipped efficiency of someone who'd already moved on to the next crisis before finishing the current one. "It's been two days since your last check-in."

Max moved away from the window, pacing the narrow strip of floor between the kitchenette and the sagging couch. "The asset is considering the proposal."

"Considering." The word came back flat, skeptical. "For forty-eight hours."

"It's a significant decision. She needs time."

"What she needs is irrelevant." Papers rustled on Carter's end. "What we need is access to Volkov's records before he moves the shipment. Our window is closing, Monroe. If this asset can't deliver—"

"She can." The words came out harder than intended.

A pause. Max could picture Carter in his climate-controlled office in Langley, leaning back in his leather chair with that expression of calculated assessment. "You sound certain."

"I am."

"Based on what? Your professional judgment or something else?"

The question landed like a blade between ribs. Max stopped pacing, staring at a water stain on the ceiling that looked like a map of somewhere he'd never been. "My professional judgment is that Roxana Volkov is intelligent, careful, and motivated. She'll make the right choice."

"And if she doesn't?"

"Then we develop another approach."

"There is no other approach. You know that." Carter's voice dropped, taking on the tone of forced patience he used when explaining obvious things to field agents who'd been out too long. "This operation has consumed significant resources. The deputy director is asking questions. I need something concrete, or I need to know we're pivoting to alternative assets."

Alternative assets. The clinical language for burning Roxana entirely, treating her as a lost cause and moving on to someone else in Viktor's orbit. Someone more pliable, more desperate, more easily manipulated.

"Give me another day," Max said.

"You said that yesterday."

"And I'm saying it again."

The silence stretched between them, crackling with unspoken implications. Finally, Carter exhaled. "Twenty-four hours, Monroe. After that, I'm making the call."

The line went dead.

Max set the phone down carefully, fighting the urge to throw it against the wall. The apartment felt smaller than ever, the air thick and stale despite the November chill seeping through the windows. He needed to move, to do something other than stand here drowning in his own thoughts.

He grabbed his jacket and headed out.

---

Vienna in late afternoon was all grey stone and golden light, the sun breaking through clouds to paint the buildings in shades of amber and rust. Max walked without destination, letting his feet carry him through the Innere Stadt while his mind churned through scenarios.

*She told Viktor. They're watching you right now, waiting for you to lead them to your contacts.*

He passed a café where an old woman fed pigeons from a paper bag, the birds swirling around her in a chaos of wings. A street musician played violin near the Stephansdom, the melody something mournful and Eastern European that made Max's chest tighten.

*She ran. She's already in Prague or Budapest or Berlin, starting over with nothing but the clothes on her back.*

He found himself on the Ringstrasse, watching trams glide past with their cargo of commuters heading home to families, to normalcy, to lives that didn't involve lying to beautiful women and waiting for phones to ring. A couple walked by holding hands, laughing about something private and perfect.

*She's considering it. Actually weighing her options, trying to decide if she can trust you after you spent weeks lying to her face.*

That was the worst scenario, somehow. Not because it endangered the mission, but because it meant she was alone with the decision, turning it over in her mind without anyone to help shoulder the weight. He'd done that to her—dropped this impossible choice in her lap and walked away, leaving her to wrestle with it in whatever gilded cage Viktor kept her in.

Max stopped at a bridge over the Wien River, gripping the railing hard enough to make his knuckles white. Below, the water moved dark and quick, carrying leaves and urban debris toward the Danube. He thought about the museum, about Roxana standing in front of that Bruegel painting, talking about how the artist showed people just living their lives while tragedy unfolded in the background.

"Most people don't even notice they're in a painting," she'd said.

But she'd noticed. She'd been noticing for years, trapped in the frame of Viktor's world, watching herself become part of the composition whether she wanted to be or not.

His phone buzzed.

Max pulled it out so fast he nearly dropped it into the river. Unknown number. Vienna area code.

His thumb hovered over the screen for a heartbeat that felt like an hour. Then he answered.

"Yes?"

"Tomorrow. Three o'clock." Roxana's voice was steady, controlled, but he could hear something underneath—fear or determination or both. "The Zentralfriedhof. Section 32A, near the Brahms grave."

"Roxana—"

"Come alone. If I see anyone else, I'm gone."

"I will. I promise."

Another pause, shorter this time. "I need to know something first."

"Anything."

"That night in the rain. When you kissed me." Her voice dropped lower, barely audible over the traffic noise bleeding through the connection. "Was any of it real?"

Max closed his eyes, the river sounds fading into white noise. Every instinct screamed at him to hedge, to maintain operational distance, to give himself room to maneuver. Carter would tell him to say whatever kept the asset engaged. His training demanded he treat this as a tactical question requiring a tactical answer.

"All of it," he said. "Every moment."

He heard her breath catch, a small sound that carried more weight than words.

"Tomorrow," she said again, and the line went dead.

Max stood on the bridge as the sun sank lower, painting the city in shades of fire and shadow. The phone felt heavy in his hand, a small rectangle of metal and glass that had just changed everything.

Twenty-four hours, Carter had said. 

He had less than that now. Less than a day to meet Roxana in a cemetery and convince her to risk everything on the word of a man who'd built their entire relationship on lies.

Max pocketed the phone and started walking back toward the safe house, his pace quicker now, purposeful. The waiting was over. The real gamble was about to begin.

Behind him, the street musician's violin shifted into a new melody—something that sounded almost like hope, if you listened carefully enough. Max didn't look back, but he carried the sound with him through the darkening streets, a fragile counterpoint to the drumbeat of his pulse.

The cemetery. Tomorrow. Three o'clock.

He had one chance to get this right.

**Scene 4: Roxana finally contacts Max thr...**

**Scene 4: Roxana finally contacts Max through an encrypted message, asking to meet at a neutral location**

The message arrived at 4:47 PM on the third day—forty-seven hours past Max's self-imposed deadline for when he'd have to assume she'd chosen Viktor.

*Donaukanal. The bench near the Aspernbrücke. 7 PM. Come alone.*

Max read it three times, searching for subtext, for hidden meaning, for any indication of what awaited him. The encryption was sophisticated—not the simple app he'd given her, but something else entirely. She'd changed the game before even showing up.

He arrived twenty minutes early, approaching from the east along the canal path. The October dusk painted the water in shades of amber and slate, and the air carried the mineral smell of the Danube mixed with fallen leaves. A handful of joggers passed by, their breath visible in the cooling air. Max noted the sight lines, the exits, the places where a sniper might position themselves.

Professional paranoia. Or maybe justified caution. The line between the two had blurred considerably since he'd confessed everything to Roxana.

He took up position on a bench fifty meters from the designated meeting spot, close enough to observe, far enough to react if this was a trap. A street musician was packing up his violin case nearby. Two students shared a joint under the Aspernbrücke, their laughter echoing off the concrete. Normal evening activity. Nothing that screamed ambush.

But Viktor's people were good. They wouldn't scream.

At 6:58, Roxana appeared.

She came from the west, walking with the unhurried grace that had first caught his attention at the gallery. She wore dark jeans and a charcoal peacoat, her hair pulled back in a simple ponytail. No jewelry. No designer labels. She looked younger this way, more like the woman she might have been if Viktor Volkov had never entered her life.

Max watched her scan the area—a quick, efficient assessment that told him she'd been trained or had learned through necessity. She spotted him immediately, though he'd positioned himself carefully. A slight nod acknowledged his presence, but she continued to the designated bench and sat, crossing her legs and pulling out her phone as if waiting for a friend.

He gave it two more minutes, watching for tails, for anyone who showed too much interest. Then he stood and walked to her.

"You're cautious," she said without looking up from her phone. "That's good. I'd hate to think I was trusting my life to an amateur."

Max sat, leaving a respectful distance between them. "You changed the encryption."

"The app you gave me was adequate for what it was. But I needed to be sure this conversation stayed private." She finally looked at him, and her eyes were different—harder, more calculating. "You're not the only one with resources, Max. Or should I say Agent Monroe? Or is it something else entirely?"

The question landed like a blade between his ribs. "What did you find?"

"Enough." She pocketed her phone and turned to face him fully. "Maxwell James Monroe. Former CIA, now freelance. You've worked for at least three different intelligence agencies in the past two years, always on contract, never official. You specialize in financial crimes and Eastern European organized crime. You have no permanent address, no real relationships, and a reputation for being very, very good at what you do."

Max kept his expression neutral, but internally he was recalibrating everything. "That must have taken considerable effort to uncover."

"I have friends you don't know about. People who owe me favors that Viktor doesn't control." A ghost of a smile crossed her lips. "Did you think I survived five years with him by being helpless? By being just a pretty accessory?"

"I never thought that."

"Didn't you?" She tilted her head, studying him. "Your whole approach was based on saving me. The damsel in the tower, waiting for rescue."

"That's not—"

"I'm not angry about it," she interrupted. "It's sweet, actually. And it tells me something important about you." She looked out at the canal, where the last light was fading from the water. "You see people as more than assets. That's rare in your profession."

A jogger passed behind them, and both fell silent until he was out of earshot. The temperature was dropping, and Max could see Roxana suppress a shiver.

"Why did you agree to meet?" he asked.

"Because despite the deception, despite the manipulation, I believe you were telling the truth about one thing." She met his eyes again. "You care what happens to me. Not just as a mission objective. As a person."

"Yes."

"That's either very professional or very dangerous."

"It's very real," Max said quietly.

Roxana studied him for a long moment, and he could see her weighing his words, testing them against whatever criteria she'd developed for detecting lies. Finally, she nodded.

"I've spent the last two days thinking about what I want," she said. "Not what Viktor wants, not what you want. What I want." She pulled her coat tighter. "Do you know what I realized?"

"Tell me."

"I'm tired of being afraid. I'm tired of measuring every word, every gesture, every breath. I'm tired of being owned." Her voice was steady, but Max heard the steel beneath it. "I want to wake up in the morning without wondering if this is the day he decides I'm more trouble than I'm worth. I want to make choices that are mine."

"I can give you that."

"Can you?" She turned to face him fully. "Because I need you to understand something, Max. If I do this—if I help you get what you need from Viktor—I'm not trading one handler for another. I'm not going from his control to yours, or to whoever you're working for."

"That's not what I'm offering."

"Then what are you offering? Specifically."

Max took a breath, knowing that what he said next would determine everything. "Documentation. A new identity that will hold up under serious scrutiny. Financial resources—enough to start over wherever you want. And protection until you're clear."

"In exchange for?"

"Access to Viktor's records. The real ones, not the sanitized versions he shows his legitimate partners. Financial transactions, communications, anything that proves what he's really running."

Roxana nodded slowly. "His safe. In the study."

"You know the combination?"

"I know where he keeps it written down. He's paranoid about forgetting it." She smiled without humor. "Ironic, isn't it? His paranoia creates vulnerabilities."

A cyclist passed, and they both watched until he disappeared around a bend in the path. The street musician was gone now, and the students had moved on. They were alone except for a few distant figures too far away to matter.

"There's something else," Roxana said. "A condition."

"Name it."

She turned to look at him directly, and in the fading light, her eyes were luminous and fierce. "I need to know this is real. What's between us. Because if I'm going to risk everything—my life, my future, whatever small safety I've managed to carve out—I need to know it's not just another lie. Another manipulation."

Max felt something shift in his chest, a barrier he'd maintained for years cracking under the weight of her directness. Every instinct he'd honed, every rule he'd followed, screamed at him to hedge, to leave himself an exit.

Instead, he said, "It's real."

"How can you be sure?"

"Because I've been doing this for fifteen years, and I've never once broken protocol for someone. I've never compromised a mission, never let personal feelings interfere." He leaned forward, elbows on his knees. "Until you. I broke every rule in the book the moment I told you the truth instead of continuing the operation as planned."

"Maybe that was part of the plan."

"It wasn't." He looked at her. "My handler doesn't even know I've approached you yet. I was supposed to gather intelligence, build a case, and then extract you as a witness if necessary. I was supposed to keep you at arm's length, maintain the cover, play it safe."

"But you didn't."

"No." The admission felt like stepping off a cliff. "Because somewhere between the gallery and the café and all those conversations about art and life and everything else, I stopped seeing you as part of the mission. I started seeing you as someone I didn't want to lose."

Roxana was quiet for a long moment, her expression unreadable. Then she reached out and took his hand—the first time she'd initiated contact since he'd revealed the truth.

"Okay," she said simply.

"Okay?"

"I'll help you. We'll do this together." She squeez

**Scene 5: Roxana agrees to help Max acces...**

**Scene 5: Roxana agrees to help Max access Viktor's safe**

The park had emptied as darkness settled over the city. Streetlamps flickered to life along the pathways, casting pools of amber light that didn't quite reach where Max and Roxana sat. The temperature had dropped, and she pulled her coat tighter, though Max suspected it wasn't entirely from the cold.

She'd been silent for nearly ten minutes, staring at the fountain that had stopped running for the night. Her profile was sharp against the dying light, beautiful and unreachable. Max forced himself not to fill the silence, not to push. He'd laid everything out—the truth about who he was, what he needed, what he could offer in return. Now it was her move.

"I need to know something," Roxana said finally, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Anything."

She turned to face him, and the vulnerability in her eyes made his chest tighten. "All of this—the gallery, the conversations, the way you looked at me—was any of it real? Or was I just another asset to be cultivated?"

Max had prepared for this question during the sleepless nights before he'd decided to approach her. He'd rehearsed careful answers that would reassure without committing, that would keep his options open while securing her cooperation. Every word of those rehearsed responses died in his throat.

"It started as an assignment," he said, meeting her gaze and holding it. "I was supposed to get close to you, gain your trust, find a way to access Viktor's inner circle. That was the plan."

Her expression hardened, and she started to stand.

"Wait." He caught her hand, felt her pulse racing beneath his fingers. "That's how it started. Not how it became."

Roxana remained poised between staying and leaving, her hand still in his.

"I don't know when it changed," Max continued, the words coming faster now, rougher. "Maybe it was that first conversation about Rothko, the way your whole face lit up when you talked about color fields and emotional resonance. Maybe it was watching you handle Viktor's associates at that dinner party—how you could be gracious and charming while I saw the steel underneath. Or maybe it was simpler than that. Maybe it was just... you."

"Pretty words," she said, but she didn't pull away. "You're trained for this, aren't you? Knowing exactly what to say to make someone feel—"

"I'm breaking every protocol by even having this conversation." Max stood, still holding her hand, close enough now that he could smell her perfume mixing with the scent of autumn leaves. "I should have recruited you through official channels. Should have kept emotional distance. Should have maintained my cover regardless of the outcome. Instead, I'm standing here telling you the truth because the thought of lying to you anymore makes me sick."

A car passed on the street beyond the park, its headlights briefly illuminating them before plunging them back into shadow.

"I could go to Viktor right now," Roxana said. "Tell him everything. You'd be dead by morning."

"Yes."

"You're trusting me with your life."

"I already was. The moment I fell for you, I was compromised." Max released her hand, giving her the choice. "I'm not asking you to trust me because of what I can offer you—the new identity, the safe passage, all of that. I'm asking you to trust that what we have is real. That I see you, Roxana. Not Viktor's wife, not an access point, not a mission objective. You."

She wrapped her arms around herself, and for a moment Max thought he'd lost her. Then she laughed—a short, sharp sound without much humor in it.

"Do you know how long it's been since someone saw me as just... me? Not as a possession, not as a trophy, not as a mistake that needs to be managed?" Her eyes glistened in the lamplight. "Five years, Max. Five years of being invisible while being constantly watched."

"You're not invisible to me."

"No," she agreed quietly. "I'm not, am I?"

The silence stretched between them, but it felt different now. Less like a chasm and more like a bridge being carefully constructed.

"I'll help you," Roxana said finally. "I'll get you access to Viktor's safe."

Relief flooded through him, but he kept his expression neutral. "Thank you. We'll need to—"

"I'm not finished." She stepped closer, close enough that he could see the gold flecks in her brown eyes. "I have one condition."

"Name it."

"Promise me." Her voice was steady now, certain. "Promise me that this—us—is real. Not the mission, not the operation, not whatever your superiors think is happening. Promise me that when this is over, when I'm safe and Viktor is in prison or dead or whatever happens to him, you won't disappear. That I won't just be another successfully completed assignment that you file away and forget about."

Max knew what he should say. He should equivocate, should leave himself an out, should maintain enough professional distance to do his job. Hammond's voice echoed in his mind: *Never make a promise you can't keep. Never let it get personal.*

He thought about Roxana's hand in his, about the way she'd looked at him in the gallery, about the risk she was taking by trusting him. He thought about the five years she'd spent being invisible, being trapped, being afraid.

Then he stopped thinking and let himself feel.

"I promise," Max said, and meant it with every fiber of his being. "This is real. You're real to me. And when this is over, I'm not going anywhere unless you want me gone."

Roxana searched his face for a long moment, and whatever she saw there must have satisfied her because she nodded slowly. "Okay. Then let's talk about how we're going to do this."

She sat back down on the bench, and Max joined her, close enough that their shoulders touched. The contact felt electric, dangerous, necessary.

"Viktor keeps his most sensitive documents in a safe in his study," Roxana began, her voice taking on a businesslike tone even as her hand found his in the darkness. "He changes the combination monthly, but I know where he keeps the written backup. He's paranoid about forgetting it."

"When can you access it?"

"Thursday night. He's flying to Moscow for meetings. He'll be gone for three days."

"That's soon."

"Is that a problem?" She glanced at him, and he saw the fear beneath her composure.

"No. It's perfect." Max squeezed her hand. "I'll need to set up surveillance, prepare extraction protocols, coordinate with my team—"

"Your team knows about me?"

"Not everything. Not about us." He turned to face her fully. "Hammond—my handler—knows I've made contact with you. He doesn't know how deep this goes."

"Will he try to stop it? Us?"

"Probably. If he knew." Max smiled grimly. "Which is why he's not going to know until it's too late to matter."

Roxana leaned her head against his shoulder, a gesture so simple and trusting that it nearly broke him. "I'm terrified," she whispered.

"Me too."

"But you do this all the time. You're trained for it."

"I'm not trained for this." Max pressed his lips to her hair. "I'm not trained for feeling like my heart's going to explode every time I think about something happening to you. I'm not trained for being willing to throw away my entire career to keep you safe."

She lifted her head, and in the amber lamplight, her smile was small but genuine. "We're both breaking all our own rules, aren't we?"

"Spectacularly."

A cool breeze rustled through the trees, carrying the scent of rain. In the distance, thunder rumbled.

"We should go," Roxana said, though she didn't move. "Viktor will expect me home soon."

"Two more minutes." Max pulled her closer, memorizing the feel of her against him, the rhythm of her breathing, the way she fit perfectly in the circle of his arms. "Just two more minutes where we're not planning operations or calculating risks. Where we're just... us."

Roxana nodded against his chest. "Just us," she echoed.

They sat in the gathering darkness as the first drops of rain began to fall, two people who'd found each other in the worst possible circumstances, making promises they weren't sure they could keep but knowing they had to try.

When they finally stood to leave, walking toward separate cars parked on opposite sides of the park, Max watched her go and felt the weight of what they were about to do settle over him like a physical thing. He'd crossed a line tonight that he could never uncross. He'd made a promise that could cost him everything.

But as Roxana paused at her

**Scene 6: With their pact sealed, Max an...**

# **Scene 6: With their pact sealed, Max and Roxana begin sketching out a plan**

The interior of Roxana's Mercedes smelled of leather and her perfume—something subtle with notes of jasmine that Max had come to associate with danger and desire in equal measure. Rain drummed against the roof, creating a cocoon of white noise that insulated them from the world outside. They'd parked in an industrial area near the old tobacco factory, where the surveillance cameras had been broken for months and no one asked questions.

Roxana had killed the engine ten minutes ago, but neither of them had moved to leave.

Max spread a hand-drawn sketch across the center console, the paper crinkling in the confined space. "The reception starts at eight. Viktor will be greeting the ambassador and his entourage in the main salon here." He tapped the drawing. "That gives us a window, but not a large one."

Roxana leaned closer, studying the layout she knew by heart but was seeing now through different eyes. The scent of her shampoo mixed with the rain-dampened air. "The safe is in his study on the second floor. East wing, third door on the right." Her finger traced the path. "But there are cameras in the hallway."

"Can you disable them?"

"Not without triggering an alert." She bit her lower lip, a gesture Max had learned meant she was thinking through a problem. "But the system has a scheduled maintenance reboot every Thursday at nine-fifteen. It's down for exactly four minutes."

Max felt a surge of adrenaline. "The reception is Thursday."

"I know." She met his eyes, and in the dim light filtering through the rain-streaked windows, he saw both fear and determination. "That's why I chose to tell you yes today. If we're going to do this, it has to be this week. Viktor leaves for Moscow on Saturday, and after that..." She didn't finish the sentence.

After that, she'd be going with him. Back into the heart of his world, where Max couldn't follow.

He pushed the thought away and focused on the sketch. "Four minutes isn't much time. I'll need to know the safe's make and model, any security features beyond the standard combination."

"It's a Hartmann Tresore. Biometric scanner and a six-digit code that Viktor changes monthly." She paused, her breath fogging slightly against the window she'd been staring through. "But he keeps a backup override code written down. He thinks I don't know about it."

"Where?"

"In his desk drawer. The one with the false bottom." A bitter smile crossed her lips. "Men like Viktor always think they're cleverer than everyone else. It never occurs to them that the people they underestimate might be watching."

Max studied her profile—the elegant line of her jaw, the tension in her shoulders, the way her hands gripped the steering wheel even though they weren't moving. "How long have you been planning this?"

She turned to face him, and the vulnerability in her expression made his chest tighten. "Planning what? Escape? Or falling for someone who might actually help me do it?" 

The question hung between them like the rain suspended in the air outside, each droplet catching the amber glow of distant streetlights.

"Roxana—"

"I need to know something, Max." She shifted in her seat, turning her body toward him fully. "When we get what you need, when I give you access to Viktor's files and his secrets and everything that could bring him down—what happens to me then? Do I become evidence? A witness to be relocated and debriefed and filed away?"

Max set the sketch aside and took her hand. Her fingers were cold despite the warmth of the car. "You become free. Whatever that means to you."

"And you?"

He should lie. Every protocol, every rule of tradecraft, every lesson learned in a career built on deception screamed at him to give her the answer that would keep her compliant and cooperative. Instead, he found himself saying, "I don't know. I've never done this before."

"Broken the rules?"

"Meant it when I broke them."

Roxana's eyes searched his face, looking for cracks in the foundation of his honesty. Whatever she found there must have satisfied her, because she squeezed his hand and returned her attention to the sketch. "The study has two entrances. The main door from the hallway, and a service door that connects to the library. Viktor never uses it—he had it installed for the architects' plans but never furnished the library properly."

"Is it locked?"

"From the inside, yes. But I have a key." She reached into her purse and produced a small brass key that caught the light. "I had a copy made three months ago. I told myself it was just in case, but I think part of me always knew I'd need it for something like this."

Max took the key, feeling its weight in his palm. Such a small thing to represent such an enormous risk. "During the reception, you'll need to keep Viktor occupied. Can you do that without raising suspicion?"

"I've been keeping Viktor occupied for two years without raising suspicion about what I really think of him." The hardness in her voice could have cut glass. "I can manage one more night."

They spent the next twenty minutes going over details—guard rotations, guest lists, potential complications. Roxana knew the household routines with the precision of someone who'd been studying them for exactly this purpose, and Max found himself impressed by her operational awareness. She would have made a good field agent in another life.

"What are we looking for specifically?" Roxana asked, pulling a small notebook from her glove compartment. "If we only have four minutes, we can't waste time sorting through everything."

"Financial records. Anything linking Viktor to the arms deals in Syria. Communications with his contacts in the Kremlin." Max paused, considering how much to tell her. "And a list. Names of people in Western governments who've been taking his money."

Roxana's pen stilled on the paper. "That's what this is really about, isn't it? Not just Viktor. He's a stepping stone to something bigger."

"Yes."

She appreciated the honesty, he could tell. No deflection, no sugar-coating. Just the truth, raw and simple.

"How many names are on this list?"

"We don't know. Could be five, could be fifty." Max watched her process this information, saw the moment she understood the full scope of what they were attempting. "If we can get that list, Roxana, it's not just about taking down Viktor. It's about exposing a network that's been corrupting governments for years."

"And if we fail?"

"Then we both disappear. Different ways, probably, but equally permanent."

The rain intensified, hammering against the roof like fingers drumming impatiently. Roxana wrote something in her notebook, then tore out the page and handed it to Max. "The override code. He changed it last week—I watched him enter it through the reflection in the window glass."

Max looked at the six digits: 281947. "What do they mean?"

"The date he first killed someone." Roxana's voice was flat, emotionless. "He told me once when he was drunk. August 28th, 1947. He was sixteen years old, during the Soviet occupation. He thinks it makes him a patriot. I think it makes him a monster who never grew beyond that scared boy with blood on his hands."

Max folded the paper and tucked it into his wallet. "You're sure about this? Once we start, there's no turning back."

Roxana reached out and touched his face, her fingers cool against his cheek. "I've been trapped in a life I didn't choose for longer than I can remember. At least this way, I'm choosing something. Even if it's dangerous, even if it's terrifying—it's mine."

He turned his head and kissed her palm, a gesture that felt both intimate and like a promise. "Thursday night, then. The reception starts at eight, the camera reboot happens at nine-fifteen. I'll enter through the service door at nine-fourteen."

"I'll make sure it's unlocked by nine." Roxana withdrew her hand and started the engine, the Mercedes purring to life. "Where should I drop you?"

"Two blocks from here. I'll walk the rest."

As she pulled out of the industrial lot, Max memorized the route she took, noting cameras and sight lines out of habit. The rain had eased to a drizzle, turning the city into a watercolor painting of blurred lights and indistinct shapes.

Roxana stopped at a corner where a broken streetlight created a pool of shadow. Before Max could open the door, she grabbed his arm.

"Max?"

He turned back to her.

"After this is over, after we have what we need and I'm free—" She hesitated, and for a moment she looked impossibly young despite everything she'd endured. "

## Chapter 7: Inside Information

**Scene 1: Roxana meets Max at their usual...**

**Scene 1: Roxana meets Max at their usual café**

The Café Landtmann occupied a corner where two narrow streets converged in Vienna's first district, its weathered façade unchanged since the 1920s. Max arrived fifteen minutes early, as always, claiming a table near the back where the afternoon light filtered through yellowed lace curtains. The espresso machine hissed and gurgled behind the marble counter, filling the air with the bitter-sweet aroma of dark roast.

He ordered a melange and spread a copy of *Die Presse* across the small round table, though his eyes barely registered the headlines. His left hand rested casually on the newspaper while his right traced idle patterns on the worn wood, fingers drumming a rhythm that betrayed the tension coiling in his chest.

Roxana arrived precisely at three o'clock.

She wore a dove-gray coat over a simple black dress, her blonde hair pulled back in a way that made her look older, more severe. Dark glasses concealed her eyes until she removed them, folding them carefully into her handbag as she slid into the chair across from him. No smile. No greeting. Just a slight nod that could have meant anything to anyone watching.

"The usual?" Max asked in German, loud enough for the waiter hovering near the kitchen door.

"Schwarzer, bitte." Her voice was steady, but he noticed the way her fingers tightened around the strap of her handbag.

Max signaled the waiter, then leaned back in his chair, affecting the posture of a man engaged in pleasant conversation with an acquaintance. "You look tired."

"Viktor hosted a dinner last night. The Hungarian ambassador and his wife. It went until two." She paused as the waiter approached with her coffee, waiting until he'd retreated before continuing. "He was in a good mood afterward. Drank more than usual."

Max felt something cold settle in his stomach. "Roxana—"

"He opened the safe." She lifted her cup, inhaling the steam. "I was bringing him water, aspirin. He didn't think I was paying attention."

The espresso machine shrieked, covering Max's sharp intake of breath. He forced himself to take a sip of his own coffee, to maintain the appearance of normalcy while his mind raced. "What did you see?"

Roxana set down her cup and reached for the sugar bowl, her movements deliberate and unhurried. She tore open a packet, tapped the contents into her coffee, stirred. To anyone watching, it was the most mundane of gestures.

"The safe is behind a painting in his study," she said softly. "Klimt reproduction. Terrible fake, but Viktor thinks it's sophisticated." Her lips curved in something that wasn't quite a smile. "It's a Bausch combination lock. German-made. The dial has to be turned right first, then left, then right again."

Max pulled a small notebook from his jacket pocket—the kind tourists used for jotting down museum hours and restaurant recommendations. He wrote the date at the top of a fresh page, then a few innocuous words about Viennese architecture. Beneath them, in smaller letters: *Bausch. R-L-R.*

"The combination?"

"I only saw part of it." Roxana's voice remained conversational, but her eyes had gone distant, as if she were watching the memory play out behind them. "He was standing in front of the dial, but I could see his hand movements. The first number is somewhere between twenty and thirty—his hand didn't move far. The second is higher, maybe sixty or seventy. The third..." She shook her head. "I couldn't see. He shifted his position."

Max wrote: *20-30 / 60-70 / ?*

"That's not enough," he said, keeping his tone light, as if commenting on the weather.

"I know." Roxana lifted her coffee cup again, and he noticed the faint tremor in her hand. "But there's more. Viktor has a pattern. Every Tuesday and Thursday morning, he goes to the embassy at nine. Doesn't return until after two. The housekeeper, Frau Hoffman, does the marketing on Tuesdays between ten and noon. The gardener only comes on Wednesdays and Saturdays."

Max's pen moved across the page, disguising intelligence in the margins of tourist notes. "Security system?"

"Basic alarm on the doors and ground-floor windows. Code is 1917." She allowed herself a thin smile. "Viktor's sense of history is predictable."

"Cameras?"

"None inside. Two outside—front entrance and the garden gate. They record to a system in the basement utility room."

Max looked up from his notebook. Roxana was watching him now, her blue eyes clear and unflinching. The tremor in her hand had steadied.

"You've been very thorough," he said quietly.

"I'm not a fool, Max. I know what this requires." She leaned forward slightly, lowering her voice until it was barely audible above the café's ambient noise. "There's a reception next Thursday. The French embassy. Some cultural exchange nonsense. Viktor expects me to attend."

"Expected attendance?"

"Two hundred people. Maybe more. It's a significant event—the ambassador will be there, along with half the diplomatic corps." Roxana's fingers traced the rim of her cup. "It starts at seven. Viktor will want to stay until at least ten, probably later. He enjoys these things, the networking."

Max felt the pieces clicking into place, saw the operation taking shape even as dread pooled in his gut. "You'd have a window. If you could slip away."

"I could claim a headache. Migraine. I get them sometimes—Viktor knows this." Her voice remained steady, but Max caught the slight catch in her breath. "I could take a car home, tell him I need to lie down. He wouldn't leave early, not for something like that. Not when there are people to impress."

The café door opened, admitting a gust of cool autumn air and two elderly women who settled at a table near the window. Max waited until their chatter filled the space before responding.

"That would leave you alone," he said. "No backup. No support if something goes wrong."

"Yes."

"Roxana—"

"What choice do we have?" She met his gaze without flinching. "You can't be there. If Viktor came home early and found you in his study, it would be over. For both of us." She paused. "This is the only way."

Max wanted to argue, to find another solution, but he knew she was right. The operation required access when Viktor was occupied and accounted for, when the house would be empty, when Roxana could move freely without raising suspicion. A diplomatic reception provided all of that.

"The documents," he said. "Where does he keep them?"

"In the safe. He removes them sometimes, works on them in his study. I've seen folders—red ones with Cyrillic markings. Official seals." Roxana's voice dropped even lower. "Last week, I heard him on the phone speaking Russian. He mentioned names. Dates. Something about a transfer scheduled for November."

Max's pen stilled. "What kind of transfer?"

"I don't know. He switched to code words when he realized I was in the hallway." She wrapped both hands around her coffee cup, as if seeking warmth. "But he was agitated afterward. Drank three glasses of vodka before dinner."

The intelligence was better than Max had hoped for, more detailed, more actionable. It also meant Roxana had been taking enormous risks, listening at doors, watching Viktor's movements, memorizing details that could get her killed if she made one wrong move.

"You need to be careful," he said, knowing how inadequate the words were. "If he suspects—"

"He doesn't." Roxana's voice carried absolute certainty. "Viktor sees what he wants to see. A beautiful wife. A trophy. Someone grateful for his protection." The bitterness in her tone was sharp enough to cut. "He doesn't see me watching. He never has."

Max made a few more notes, disguising them among sketches of the café's interior, architectural details that meant nothing. When he looked up again, Roxana was studying his face with an intensity that made him uncomfortable.

"What?" he asked.

"You're afraid."

"Of course I'm afraid. This is—"

"Not for yourself." She tilted her head slightly. "For me."

Max closed his notebook, slipped it back into his jacket. "We should discuss operational details. Timing, equipment, contingencies."

"Max."

He met her eyes, saw understanding there that went deeper than tradecraft or operational necessity. "Yes. I'm afraid for you. That's not professional, and it's not helpful, but it's the truth."

Roxana reached across the table, her hand hovering near his for just

**Scene 2: In a secure safehouse, Max tra...**

**Scene 2: In a secure safehouse, Max trains Roxana in basic tradecraft techniques**

The safehouse smelled of old radiator heat and furniture polish. Max had chosen it deliberately—a fourth-floor walkup in Vienna's 7th district, the kind of building where neighbors minded their own business and footsteps on the stairs provided ample warning. Late afternoon light filtered through lace curtains, casting geometric shadows across the worn parquet floor.

Roxana stood at the dining table, her coat draped over a chair, examining the miniature Minox camera with the focused intensity Max had come to recognize. She turned it over in her hands, testing its weight, her pianist's fingers exploring the mechanism with surprising delicacy.

"It's smaller than I imagined," she said.

"German engineering." Max moved beside her, close enough to catch the scent of her perfume—something subtle, expensive. He forced himself to focus on the task. "The Minox B. Eight millimeters. Fits in the palm of your hand, and it can photograph documents with perfect clarity in low light."

He demonstrated, clicking the shutter mechanism. The sound was barely audible, a whisper of metal on metal.

"How many exposures?"

"Fifty per cassette. More than enough for what you'll need." He set the camera down and spread several sheets of typed text across the table—CIA training documents, meaningless bureaucratic drivel that looked official enough for practice. "The key is consistency. Same distance every time, same lighting if possible. Viktor's study has a desk lamp?"

"Brass. On the left side of his desk."

"Good. Position each document directly under the light. Hold the camera at chest height, fourteen inches from the paper. The focus is preset—you don't need to adjust anything." He handed her the camera. "Try it."

Roxana positioned herself over the first document, raising the camera. Her hand trembled slightly.

"Breathe," Max said quietly. "You're not being timed. Not yet."

She exhaled slowly, steadied her grip, and clicked. The sound seemed louder in the silent apartment.

"Again. Five more."

She worked through the stack, her movements growing more fluid with each exposure. Max watched her face—the concentration tightening the corners of her eyes, the way she bit her lower lip between shots. She was memorizing the motion, building muscle memory.

"How was that?" she asked, lowering the camera.

"Twelve seconds for six documents. Not bad for a first attempt." He gathered the papers, shuffled them, spread them out again. "Do it in eight."

This time she moved faster, more confident. The camera whispered its mechanical rhythm.

"Seven seconds," Max said, checking his watch. "You're a natural."

"I spent fifteen years performing Chopin under scrutiny. This is just a different kind of performance." But her smile didn't reach her eyes. "What happens if someone comes home early? If Viktor forgets something?"

Max had been dreading this question. He moved to the window, checking the street below—a habit, always checking. "You abort. Leave everything exactly as you found it and get out. There's a service entrance through the kitchen that leads to the back courtyard. From there, you can access the alley behind Brahmsplatz. I'll have a car positioned two blocks north, on Neustiftgasse."

"And if I can't get to the car?"

"Then you walk. Calmly. You're a diplomat's wife who felt unwell at a reception and came home early. Nothing suspicious about that." He turned from the window. "But Roxana, if there's any indication that something's wrong—if you feel watched, if the timing seems off—you don't go through with it. Do you understand?"

"I understand the words you're saying." She set the camera down carefully. "But we both know I won't abort. Not when we're this close."

The certainty in her voice sent ice through Max's chest. He'd seen this before—assets who became so committed to an operation that they lost their sense of self-preservation. It was useful, professionally. It was also terrifying.

"Let me show you something else." He retrieved a small leather case from his jacket, opened it to reveal a compact set of lockpicks. "You said you've seen Viktor open the safe twice. That you memorized part of the combination."

"The first three numbers. Twenty-seven, fourteen, thirty-eight. Then he shifted position and I couldn't see the rest."

Max nodded, unsurprised. Most people were creatures of habit, careless with their secrets. "A six-number combination. That leaves three unknowns. Do you remember which direction he turned the dial for each number?"

Roxana closed her eyes, and Max watched her face as she replayed the memory. "Right for twenty-seven. Left for fourteen. Right again for thirty-eight. Then... left, right, left for the last three."

"You're certain?"

"I have perfect pitch, Max. I remember patterns." She opened her eyes. "Will that help?"

"It narrows the possibilities considerably. But we're still talking about a thousand potential combinations for the last three numbers." He studied her expression, looking for doubt, for hesitation. Found only steel resolve. "There's another option. If you can get me into the house when Viktor's away, I can crack it myself."

"No." The word was immediate, absolute. "Viktor has the house watched when he's gone. Security checks twice daily. A stranger in the house would be noticed immediately." She picked up the camera again, testing its weight. "Besides, I know the safe. I've watched him. This is my operation."

*My operation.* Max felt something twist in his chest—pride and terror in equal measure.

"Then we practice the combination work." He pulled a portable safe from beneath the table—a training model he'd requisitioned from the Vienna station. "Standard rotary dial, same as Viktor's. I'm going to teach you how to feel for the contact points, how to work through combinations systematically."

For the next hour, they worked in focused silence broken only by the clicking of the dial and Max's quiet instructions. Roxana's fingers moved across the metal surface with the same precision she'd shown with the camera, learning to sense the subtle resistance that indicated a correct number.

The light outside shifted from gold to amber to grey. Max switched on the table lamp, and in its warm glow, Roxana looked younger, more vulnerable. A woman who should have been preparing for a concert, not a covert operation that could get her killed.

"I need to know," she said suddenly, not looking up from the safe. "If something goes wrong. If I'm caught. What happens to me?"

Max had prepared for this question too, had rehearsed various versions of reassurance. But looking at her now, backlit by the lamp, her hands steady on the dial, he found he couldn't lie.

"Best case, diplomatic scandal. Viktor divorces you, you're expelled from Austria. We bring you in, debrief you, resettle you somewhere safe."

"And worst case?"

"You disappear. Viktor has friends in the KGB who don't respect diplomatic niceties. They'd want to know everything—who recruited you, what you've passed, what else you know." He paused. "I won't let it get that far."

Roxana looked up at him then, and her smile was sad, knowing. "You can't promise that."

"No," Max admitted. "But I can promise I'll do everything in my power to get you out. I have a team standing by, independent of official channels. If you signal for extraction, they'll move immediately."

"Independent of official channels." She set down the dial. "You mean your superiors don't know about them."

"What they don't know can't be compromised."

"Or what they don't know can't stop you from doing something foolish." Roxana stood, moved closer to him. In the lamplight, he could see the fine lines around her eyes, the shadows beneath them. "You're risking your career for me."

"I'm ensuring an asset's safety. Standard protocol."

"Is it?" She was close enough now that he could feel the warmth of her. "Is this how you treat all your assets, Max?"

The question hung between them, dangerous and honest. Through the window, Vienna's evening sounds filtered up—a tram bell, distant traffic, someone's radio playing Strauss. The ordinary life of a city that had no idea what was happening in this anonymous apartment.

"No," Max said finally. "It isn't."

Roxana nodded, as if he'd confirmed something she already knew. She returned to the table, to the safe and the camera and the careful choreography of espionage. "Show me again," she said. "The emergency protocols. I want to know every exit, every contingency."

So Max walked her through it again. The routes, the signals, the dead drops. The

**Scene 3: Max reviews the plan for the u...**

**Scene 3: Max reviews the plan for the upcoming diplomatic reception**

The safehouse apartment felt smaller in the evening light, shadows pooling in the corners like spilled ink. Max had spread a hand-drawn floor plan of the Volkov residence across the scarred wooden table, weighted down at the corners with coffee cups and a half-empty bottle of vodka neither of them had touched.

Roxana stood beside him, her arms crossed, studying the diagram with the same intensity she might give to a medical chart. The window behind them was cracked open, letting in the distant sounds of Moscow traffic and the faint smell of rain on concrete.

"Walk me through it again," Max said, tapping the paper with his pen. "From the moment you arrive at the reception."

She didn't hesitate. "We arrive at the Metropol at eight. Viktor will make his rounds—he always does. The Bulgarian ambassador, the trade minister, probably twenty minutes of conversation with each. I'll stay close initially, play the dutiful wife."

"How long before you make your move?"

"Nine-fifteen at the earliest. Not before the first course is served. If I leave too early, people notice. Too late, and Viktor starts looking for me." She traced a finger along the route from the hotel to their home. "Fifteen minutes by car, assuming Dmitri doesn't hit traffic on Tverskaya."

Max felt his jaw tighten. Dmitri was Viktor's driver, loyal as a guard dog. "You're sure he'll take you without question?"

"I'll tell him I have a migraine. That I forgot my medication at home." Roxana's voice was steady, but Max caught the slight tension in her shoulders. "Dmitri has driven me home early before. Twice in the past year."

"And if he insists on waiting?"

"I send him back. Tell him I need to lie down, that Viktor will call when he's ready to leave." She met Max's eyes. "Dmitri won't argue. He knows better than to keep Viktor waiting at these events."

Max nodded, making a notation on the timeline he'd sketched beside the floor plan. The margins were already crowded with his tight handwriting—contingencies, abort signals, emergency protocols. "So you're home by nine-thirty. That gives you what, ninety minutes before Viktor typically leaves these things?"

"Closer to two hours. He never leaves before eleven-thirty. It would be rude." A bitter smile crossed her face. "Viktor is very concerned with appearances."

"Two hours to get into the study, open the safe, photograph everything, replace it all exactly as it was, and get back to the reception." Max set down his pen and rubbed his eyes. "Roxana, that's—"

"Tight. I know." She moved around the table, pointing to the study marked on the floor plan. "But the staff will be gone. Irina has Thursday nights off, and Sergei always visits his sister when Viktor is out. The house will be empty."

Max studied her profile in the fading light. She'd pulled her hair back, and without makeup, she looked younger than her thirty-four years. Vulnerable. The thought made his chest constrict.

"What about the alarm system?"

"Disabled when we're home. Viktor only sets it when the house is completely empty." She glanced at him. "He's paranoid about foreign threats, not domestic ones. It's his blind spot."

"Let's hope it stays that way." Max picked up the miniature camera they'd been practicing with—a Minox C, small enough to conceal in a compact or cigarette case. "Show me again. Documents on the desk, proper lighting."

Roxana took the camera, her fingers finding the controls without looking. She'd practiced for hours over the past three days, until the movements became muscle memory. "Lay the document flat. Check the frame through the viewfinder. Steady pressure on the shutter release." She mimed the action, her hands rock-steady. "Two shots of each page, different angles in case one is blurred."

"And if you hear something? Car in the driveway, key in the lock?"

"Leave everything. Exit through the kitchen to the garden. Over the back wall to the Petrovs' property." She set down the camera. "You'll have someone waiting on Sretensky Boulevard?"

"A car. Dark blue Volga. If you make it there, they'll take you straight to the embassy." Max didn't mention that he'd had to call in personal favors for this, that Sabine Voss would have his head if she knew he was running an unauthorized extraction. "But that's only if everything goes completely wrong. The plan is for you to get back to the reception."

"I know the plan, Max."

"I need you to know the backup plan. And the backup to the backup." He moved closer, unable to help himself. "If Viktor suspects anything—"

"He won't."

"If he does—" Max caught her wrist, gently but firmly. "Roxana, if he suspects, you run. You don't try to explain, you don't try to salvage it. You run, and you don't look back."

She looked down at his hand on her wrist, then back up at his face. In the dimming light, her eyes were dark pools. "And leave you with nothing? After everything we've—"

"I don't care about the operation." The words came out harder than he intended. "I care about you getting out alive."

The silence between them stretched taut. Outside, a siren wailed, distant and mournful.

Roxana pulled her wrist free, but not unkindly. "Let's go through the timing again. If I'm back at the reception by eleven, what's my story?"

Max forced himself to focus, to slip back into the professional distance he'd been trained to maintain. "You went home, took your medication, rested for an hour. You felt better and didn't want to abandon Viktor at such an important event. Dmitri brought you back."

"Will Dmitri confirm that?"

"He won't have a choice if you call him to come get you. Just make sure you're visible at the reception before Viktor starts looking." Max checked his watch. "We should run through the camera work again. In lower light this time. The study will only have the desk lamp."

Roxana nodded, but she was looking at the floor plan again, her brow furrowed. "There's something I haven't told you."

Max felt ice slide down his spine. "What?"

"The safe combination. I said I'd memorized part of it." She traced a finger along the edge of the table. "I've memorized all of it. I've watched Viktor open it four times now, not twice. I'm certain of the numbers."

Relief and new fear warred in Max's chest. "Why didn't you say something?"

"Because I wanted to be sure. Because if I'm wrong, if I trigger the lock mechanism..." She met his eyes. "There's no coming back from that. Viktor would know immediately that someone tried to access it."

"Can you open it?"

"Yes."

The certainty in her voice should have reassured him. Instead, it made everything feel more real, more immediate. They were actually going to do this. In less than forty-eight hours, Roxana would be alone in that house, her hands on Viktor Volkov's safe, one mistake away from exposure, imprisonment, or worse.

Max moved to the window, needing air, needing distance. The Moscow skyline stretched before him, lights beginning to wink on as dusk deepened into night. Somewhere out there, Viktor Volkov was sitting in his study, perhaps opening that very safe, unaware that his wife had become his greatest vulnerability.

"We should eat something," Roxana said behind him. "You haven't eaten all day."

"Neither have you."

"I'm not hungry."

Max turned to find her still at the table, one hand resting on the floor plan as if she could absorb the layout through her fingertips. The set of her shoulders told him everything—she was terrified and trying desperately not to show it.

He crossed back to her, close enough to smell her perfume, something subtle and expensive that Viktor had probably bought her. "Roxana—"

"Don't." She held up a hand. "Don't tell me I don't have to do this. Don't give me an out. I've made my choice."

"I was going to say you're the bravest person I've ever met."

Her composure cracked, just for a moment. She looked away, blinking rapidly. "I don't feel brave. I feel like I'm standing on the edge of a cliff."

"That's what courage is. Being terrified and jumping anyway." Max reached for her hand, laced his fingers through hers. "But you don't jump alone. I'll be there. Not in the house, but close. Monitoring the radio frequency

**Scene 4: Max secretly contacts a CIA ex...**

**Scene 4: Max secretly contacts a CIA extraction team**

The phone booth smelled of stale cigarettes and damp wool, its glass panels fogged with condensation from the evening rain. Max wedged himself inside, pulling the folding door closed with more force than necessary. The overhead bulb flickered, casting erratic shadows across the scratched metal surfaces.

He fed a handful of coins into the slot and dialed a number he'd committed to memory three years ago—one he'd sworn never to use except in the most extreme circumstances.

The line clicked twice. Then silence.

"Nightingale," Max said quietly, using the recognition code.

Another click. "This line is for emergencies only." The voice was American, flat and professional. Boston accent, maybe. Someone Max had never met.

"This qualifies."

"Authentication?"

Max recited a twelve-digit sequence, his breath forming small clouds in the cramped space. Outside, a couple hurried past beneath a shared umbrella, their laughter muffled by the rain drumming against the booth's metal roof.

"Authenticated. What's your situation?"

"I need an extraction package. Full protocol. Vienna station, but off-book."

The pause that followed stretched long enough for Max's pulse to accelerate. He pressed his free hand against the cold glass, watching water stream down in rivulets.

"Off-book means unauthorized," the voice said carefully. "You understand what you're requesting?"

"I understand perfectly."

"Does your handler know?"

"No."

Another pause. Max could hear the faint sound of typing on the other end. Someone making notes, or perhaps checking his file, verifying he had the authority to make such a request—even if that authority would evaporate the moment Sabine Voss discovered what he'd done.

"Asset or personal?"

The question hung in the air like smoke. Max closed his eyes. The truth would complicate things. A lie might get Roxana killed.

"Both," he said.

The typing stopped. "That's a problem."

"It's my problem."

"It becomes our problem if this goes sideways. If you're compromised, if the asset is compromised, if Vienna station gets burned because you decided to play hero—"

"I'm not playing anything." Max's voice hardened. "I need a clean extraction route, a safe house outside Vienna, and a standby team within thirty minutes of the target location. I need it ready by tomorrow night."

"Tomorrow?" The voice cracked slightly, professional composure slipping. "Jesus Christ. What kind of operation are we talking about?"

"The kind that doesn't exist on paper."

More typing. Max watched a streetcar glide past, its windows glowing warm yellow against the darkness. Normal people heading home to normal lives. He'd forgotten what that felt like.

"I can get you a team," the voice said finally. "But it'll cost you. Not money—your career. You go off-book on something like this, and if it blows up, you're done. No protection, no plausible deniability. They'll hang you out to dry."

"I know."

"And you're still requesting this?"

Max thought of Roxana's face in the café, the way her hands had trembled when she'd described Viktor's safe. The way she'd looked at him when she'd agreed to this insanity, trusting him to keep her alive.

"I'm still requesting this."

A long exhale crackled through the receiver. "Give me the details. Location, timeline, contingencies."

Max rattled off the information quickly, precisely. Viktor's address, the diplomatic reception's schedule, the three-hour window when the house would be empty except for Roxana. He described the backup plans, the abort signals, the ways it could all go wrong.

"If she signals compromise, I need your team moving immediately. Not in five minutes, not in two—immediately."

"Understood. Anything else?"

"If this goes south, if Viktor discovers what she's done—she gets priority extraction. Not the documents, not the operation. Her."

"That's not how this works."

"That's how this works for me." Max's voice dropped to something barely above a whisper, but there was steel underneath. "Or I hang up now and do this completely alone."

The silence stretched out again. Max could hear his own heartbeat, feel the cramped walls of the phone booth pressing in. His breath had fogged the glass completely now, sealing him in a private cocoon of condensation and shadow.

"All right," the voice said. "But you're signing your own termination papers."

"Then I'll sign them."

"Team will be in position by twenty-two hundred hours tomorrow. Safe house coordinates will be delivered via dead drop—usual location, Stadtpark, north bench. Recognition phrase is 'the weather's better in Prague.' Response is 'but the coffee's terrible.'"

"Confirmed."

"And Monroe? When this is over, assuming you're still breathing, you and I never had this conversation."

"What conversation?"

The line went dead.

Max hung up the receiver slowly, his hand lingering on the cold plastic. Through the fogged glass, Vienna blurred into abstract shapes of light and darkness. Somewhere out there, Sabine Voss was probably filing reports, trusting him to follow protocol. Somewhere, Roxana was preparing herself for tomorrow night, trusting him to keep her safe.

He couldn't do both.

He pushed open the phone booth door and stepped into the rain. It soaked through his coat immediately, cold and cleansing. He didn't bother pulling up his collar. The walk back to his apartment would take twenty minutes, and he needed every one of them to prepare for what he'd just set in motion.

The die was cast. Tomorrow night, Roxana would walk into Viktor's study and photograph documents that could reshape the intelligence landscape of Eastern Europe. And if anything went wrong—if Viktor returned early, if the household staff discovered her, if the KGB had somehow compromised her from the start—Max had just burned every bridge in his career to make sure she'd survive it.

He turned up a side street, his footsteps echoing off the wet cobblestones. In his pocket, his hand found the miniature camera he'd been carrying—the one he'd give to Roxana tomorrow during their final training session.

Such a small thing to risk everything for.

But then again, Roxana was risking more.

**Scene 5: The night before the operation...**

The hotel room was smaller than Roxana had imagined. Somehow she'd expected something grander from the CIA—leather chairs, perhaps, or sleek modern furniture. Instead, Max's room at the Pension Neuer Markt was modest: a double bed with a wrought-iron headframe, cream-colored walls that had yellowed with age, a single window overlooking a courtyard where rain now pattered against cobblestones.

She stood by that window, still wearing her coat, watching the water stream down the glass.

"You don't have to stay," Max said quietly behind her. He was sitting on the edge of the bed, forearms resting on his knees. "I can take you back."

Roxana turned. The room's single lamp cast warm shadows across his face, highlighting the tension in his jaw, the exhaustion around his eyes. They'd spent three hours going over the operation until every movement was choreographed, every contingency planned. Now, at midnight, there was nothing left to rehearse.

"Do you want me to go?"

The question hung between them. Max stood slowly, crossed to where she stood. His hand reached up, hesitated, then gently brushed a strand of dark hair from her face.

"No," he said. "God, no."

She turned back to the window, and he moved behind her, close enough that she could feel his warmth. In the glass, their reflections overlapped—two ghosts suspended between the room's amber light and the courtyard's darkness.

"I used to love the rain," Roxana said. "When I was a girl in Moscow, I would sneak onto our apartment's balcony during storms. My mother would scold me, say I'd catch pneumonia." She smiled faintly. "Viktor hates the rain. Says it reminds him of his childhood, of being poor."

Max's hands settled on her shoulders, a gentle weight. "Tell me something else. Something real."

"What do you mean?"

"Anything. Your favorite book. The first concert you attended. What you wanted to be when you were ten." His voice dropped. "I want to know you. Not the asset. Not the operation. You."

Roxana closed her eyes. Through the window, she could hear Vienna settling into sleep—distant traffic, a church bell tolling the hour, the rain's steady percussion.

"I wanted to be a pianist," she said. "I was actually quite good. My teacher said I had the hands for it—long fingers, good reach." She flexed her hands against the glass. "My father was a literature professor. Not wealthy, not connected, just... good. He died when I was seventeen. Heart attack in his office, grading papers."

Max's grip tightened almost imperceptibly.

"My mother remarried within a year. A Party official. I was nineteen when Viktor noticed me at a reception." Her laugh was bitter. "I thought he was sophisticated. Worldly. I thought marrying him meant freedom."

"Roxana—"

"Tomorrow," she interrupted, "when I photograph those documents, when I betray him—it should feel like justice, shouldn't it? Like I'm finally taking something back." She turned in Max's arms, meeting his eyes. "But it doesn't. It feels like I'm falling from a very high place, and I don't know what's at the bottom."

Max cupped her face in his hands. His thumbs traced her cheekbones with infinite gentleness. "I won't let you fall."

"You can't promise that."

"I know." His forehead touched hers. "But I'm making the promise anyway."

The kiss, when it came, was soft and desperate all at once. Roxana's hands found the fabric of his shirt, clutching it as if he were an anchor in a storm. Max pulled her closer, one hand tangling in her hair, the other at the small of her back, and for a moment the fear receded, replaced by something equally terrifying—the realization that this man, this American spy she'd known for mere weeks, had become essential.

When they broke apart, both were breathing hard.

"I'm scared," Roxana whispered. It was the first time she'd said it aloud.

"Me too."

She looked at him, surprised. Max guided her to the bed, and they sat together, shoulders touching. He took her hand, tracing the lines of her palm with one finger.

"In Saigon," he said quietly, "I lost someone. An informant. A good man with a family. I promised him he'd be safe, that we'd get him out." His finger stilled. "I was wrong. They found him before the extraction. Made an example of him."

"Max—"

"I've run dozens of operations since then. Recruited assets, gathered intelligence, completed missions. But I never..." He paused, struggling for words. "I never felt like this. Like if something goes wrong tomorrow, it won't just be a professional failure. It'll be—"

"The end of something that barely got to begin," Roxana finished.

Their eyes met, and the understanding that passed between them needed no words.

They lay down together, still clothed, Roxana's head on Max's chest, his arm around her shoulders. The rain continued its rhythm against the window. Neither spoke about the morning, about the diplomatic reception or the miniature camera or the safe in Viktor's study. Those realities would come soon enough.

"Tell me about Montana," Roxana said into the darkness. "Your cabin in the mountains."

Max's hand moved in slow circles on her back. "It's small. One room, really, with a loft for sleeping. There's a stream about fifty yards down the slope—you can hear it at night. In winter, the snow gets so deep you can't reach the road for weeks."

"It sounds lonely."

"It is." His voice was soft. "But sometimes lonely is safer."

Roxana tilted her head to look at him. "And after tomorrow? Will you go back there?"

The question carried weight they both recognized. Max's hand stilled on her back.

"I don't know," he admitted. "I don't know anything anymore except that I want you safe. Everything else is—" He stopped, jaw working.

Roxana reached up, touching his face. "Say it."

"Secondary." The word came out rough. "Everything else is secondary."

She kissed him then, slow and searching, tasting the confession on his lips. When they settled back together, her fingers intertwined with his, holding on.

Outside, the rain began to ease. A clock somewhere chimed two. Vienna slept, unaware that in a modest hotel room near the Stephansplatz, two people were storing up moments against an uncertain future—the warmth of skin, the rhythm of breathing, the weight of hands clasped in the dark.

"I'm glad it was you," Roxana whispered. "If this had to happen—if I had to do this—I'm glad it was you who found me."

Max pulled her closer, his lips against her hair. "Sleep," he murmured. "I've got you."

But neither of them slept. They lay awake through the small hours, two souls suspended between what they'd been and what they'd become, knowing that dawn would bring the reckoning. The miniature camera sat on the dresser, a tiny mechanical eye that would see everything tomorrow. The extraction plan was memorized. The contingencies prepared.

All that remained was the doing.

As gray light began to seep around the curtains, Roxana felt Max's breathing finally slow into something approaching rest. She studied his face in the dimness—the strong jaw, the lines that spoke of too many secrets carried too long, the vulnerability that sleep revealed.

She memorized it all, storing every detail like the documents she'd photograph in a few short hours.

Because after today, nothing would be the same.

And neither of them could promise they'd survive what came next.

**Scene 6: In the early morning hours bef...**

**Scene 6: In the early morning hours before dawn**

The city beyond the window existed in that liminal space between night and morning, when Moscow held its breath before exhaling into another day. Max sat in the leather chair by the window, the extraction plans spread across his lap like a hand of cards he couldn't afford to lose.

Roxana slept in his bed, her dark hair fanned across the pillow, one hand curled beneath her cheek. The streetlight from below cast amber shadows across her face, softening the tension that had lived there for the past three days of preparation. In sleep, she looked younger. Vulnerable.

Max's chest tightened.

He forced his attention back to the documents. The extraction route was clean—a diplomatic vehicle would be waiting three blocks from Viktor's residence at 22:00 hours. Roxana would have exactly forty-seven minutes from the moment she left the reception to photograph the contents of the safe and reach the pickup point. The CIA team didn't know her identity; they'd been told only that they were extracting a high-value asset. Sabine Voss's name appeared nowhere in the operational paperwork.

Because Sabine Voss didn't know this operation existed.

Max rubbed his eyes, feeling the weight of every protocol he'd violated, every rule he'd broken. Going off-book. Running an unauthorized extraction. Falling in—

He stopped that thought before it could fully form, but it was too late. The truth sat in his chest like a stone.

*Cardinal sin of espionage*, his instructor at the Farm had said, twenty years and a lifetime ago. *The moment you care more about your asset than the mission, you've already lost.*

Roxana stirred, murmuring something in Russian he couldn't quite catch. Her hand reached across the empty space where he'd been lying hours before, searching. Even in sleep, she was looking for him.

Max set the papers aside and moved to the bed, sitting carefully on its edge. He shouldn't touch her. Shouldn't compound the mistake he'd already made. But his hand moved of its own accord, brushing a strand of hair from her forehead.

She was risking everything tomorrow night. Her marriage, her safety, possibly her life. And for what? Idealism? Revenge against a husband who'd turned their home into a prison? Or something else—something that had grown between them in stolen moments and whispered conversations?

The extraction plans were perfect. He'd checked them seventeen times. The timing was tight but achievable. The safe house in Helsinki was ready. New identity documents waited in a locked drawer. He'd thought of everything.

Except how to live with himself if something went wrong.

Roxana's eyes opened, finding him immediately in the darkness. "You're still awake."

"Couldn't sleep."

She sat up, the sheet pooling around her waist. In the amber light, her eyes looked almost gold. "Second thoughts?"

"About the operation?" Max shook his head. "It's solid. You'll be fine."

"That's not what I asked."

The silence stretched between them, filled with everything they hadn't said, couldn't say. In the distance, a church bell tolled five times. Two hours until dawn. Twelve hours until the reception.

"I've been doing this for fifteen years," Max said finally, his voice low. "Recruited assets in seven countries. Ran operations in places that would make tomorrow night look like a walk in the park." He met her gaze. "I've never been afraid before."

Roxana reached for his hand, her fingers cool against his palm. "I'm afraid too."

"You don't have to do this. We can abort. Find another way."

"There is no other way." Her grip tightened. "You know that."

He did know. The documents in Viktor's safe contained proof of a network that stretched from Moscow to Washington, names of compromised officials, details of operations that could reshape the intelligence landscape. If they didn't act now, the window would close. People would die. Assets would be burned.

The mission was everything.

Except it wasn't. Not anymore.

Max lifted her hand to his lips, pressing a kiss to her knuckles. "I'm going to get you out," he said, and it sounded like a vow. "Whatever happens tomorrow night, whatever goes wrong—I will get you out. Do you understand?"

Roxana's free hand came up to cup his face, her thumb tracing the line of his jaw. "I trust you."

Those three words nearly broke him.

He pulled her close, breathing in the scent of her hair, feeling her heartbeat against his chest. Outside, the sky was beginning to lighten, purple bleeding into the darkness. In a few hours, she would return to Viktor's house. Put on the designer dress for the reception. Smile and play the role of the perfect diplomat's wife one final time.

And Max would be in position, monitoring the operation from a surveillance van three blocks away, every second an eternity until she was safe.

"When this is over," Roxana whispered against his shoulder, "when we're in Helsinki—"

"Don't." Max's voice was rough. "Don't plan that far ahead. Just focus on tomorrow night. One step at a time."

She pulled back to look at him, and something in her expression made his breath catch. "You think we won't make it."

"I think," Max said carefully, "that I've never wanted anything to work as much as I want this to work."

The admission hung between them, heavy with implications. Roxana's eyes searched his face, and whatever she saw there made her lean forward, pressing her forehead to his.

"Then it will work," she said. "It has to."

Max closed his eyes, committing this moment to memory—the weight of her against him, the sound of her breathing, the way the dawn light was starting to paint the room in shades of rose and gold. Tomorrow, everything would change. Tomorrow, they would both cross lines they could never uncross.

But right now, in this stolen moment before the world woke up, he allowed himself to hold her. To make a silent promise that he would keep her safe, even if it meant sacrificing everything else.

Even if it meant sacrificing himself.

The church bell tolled again, marking the half hour. Time was running out, the way it always did. Max opened his eyes and looked at the extraction plans still scattered on the chair, at the miniature camera on the nightstand, at all the careful preparations that would either save them or damn them.

"We should go over it one more time," he said quietly. "The timeline, the contingencies—"

"Max." Roxana's voice was soft but firm. "We've been over it a hundred times. I know what to do."

"If Viktor comes back early—"

"I abort and go to the secondary extraction point."

"If the safe combination has changed—"

"I photograph what I can access and leave. No heroics." She took his face in both hands, forcing him to meet her eyes. "I know the plan. I know the risks. And I know you'll be there."

He wanted to argue, to run through every scenario one more time, to find some flaw in the operation that he could fix before it was too late. But the look in her eyes stopped him.

She wasn't afraid. Not of tomorrow, not of Viktor, not of the impossible thing they were about to attempt.

She was only afraid of one thing: that he wouldn't let her do this.

Max pulled her close again, pressing a kiss to her temple. "Okay," he whispered. "Okay."

They lay back down together as the dawn broke over Moscow, neither of them sleeping, both of them counting down the hours until everything changed. And in the growing light, Max made his final calculation—the one that mattered more than all the others.

No matter what it cost him, no matter what rules he had to break or bridges he had to burn, he would get Roxana Volkov out alive.

Even if it meant destroying himself in the process.

## Chapter 8: The Operation

**Scene 1: Max conducts final equipment c...**

**Scene 1: Max conducts final equipment checks in the surveillance van**

The van smelled of stale coffee, electrical equipment, and nervous sweat. Max adjusted the brightness on the center monitor, his eyes scanning the grid of surveillance feeds that bathed the cramped interior in a cold blue glow. Outside, the streets of Brussels were alive with evening traffic, but inside this converted delivery vehicle, the world had contracted to pixels and frequencies.

"Audio check on channel three," he said, his voice low and controlled despite the adrenaline coursing through his veins.

"Clear as crystal," responded Jenkins, the tech specialist squeezed into the corner behind a bank of recording equipment. His fingers danced across a laptop keyboard, adjusting levels on a digital mixer that looked like it belonged in a recording studio rather than a spy operation.

Max's gaze fixed on the screen showing the front entrance of the Palais d'Egmont. Luxury vehicles arrived in a steady stream, disgorging diplomats and their partners in evening wear. The scene looked like something from a glossy magazine—all champagne elegance and refined power.

Then he saw her.

The black Mercedes pulled to the curb, and Viktor emerged first, straightening his tuxedo with practiced ease. He turned, extending his hand, and Roxana stepped out into the golden light spilling from the palace entrance.

Max's breath caught.

She wore a deep emerald gown that caught the light like water, her dark hair swept up to reveal the elegant line of her neck. The woman he'd spent countless hours with in safe houses and training rooms had transformed into someone who belonged in this world of wealth and influence. But Max could see what others couldn't—the slight tension in her shoulders, the way her smile didn't quite reach her eyes.

"Target acquired. They're entering now," said Rodriguez from the passenger seat, tracking them through a telephoto lens.

Max tapped the encrypted transmitter. "Nightingale, do you copy?"

A pause that lasted three heartbeats too long. Then her voice, barely a whisper, came through crystal clear in his earpiece. "Copy."

"You look beautiful." The words escaped before he could stop them, unprofessional and revealing. Jenkins glanced at him but said nothing.

"Is that mission-critical information, Control?" Her tone carried the ghost of humor, but Max heard the tremor beneath it.

"Negative. Just stating facts." He forced himself back into operational mode, his fingers pulling up the building's floor plan on a secondary screen. "Remember, you have eyes on every exit. We've confirmed Viktor's driver is parked on Rue du Grand Cerf. When you're ready to move, the headache protocol initiates phase two."

"Understood."

On the screen, Viktor's hand rested possessively on the small of Roxana's back as they ascended the palace steps. Max's jaw tightened.

"Vitals?" he asked Jenkins without taking his eyes off the monitors.

"Heart rate elevated but stable. One-twenty. Respiration normal. She's holding it together."

The couple disappeared through the ornate entrance. Max switched to the interior feeds—grainy images from micro-cameras their advance team had planted two days ago. The reception hall glittered with crystal chandeliers and the flash of jewelry. Waiters circulated with champagne flutes. A string quartet played something classical that Max couldn't identify.

"Thermal imaging shows approximately sixty-seven individuals in the main hall," Rodriguez reported. "Security detail of twelve, positioned here, here, and here." He pointed to heat signatures along the perimeter.

Max tracked Roxana's emerald dress through the crowd. She accepted a champagne glass, laughed at something a Belgian diplomat said, played the role of the devoted wife with disturbing perfection. Viktor never strayed far, his hand always finding her elbow, her waist, maintaining ownership.

"She's good," Jenkins murmured. "Really good."

Too good, Max thought. The line between performance and reality had a way of blurring in deep cover operations. He'd seen it happen before—operatives who disappeared into their legends and never quite found their way back.

"Nightingale, status check," he said into the mic.

"Making the rounds. Viktor is introducing me to the German attaché." Her voice remained steady, but Max could hear the ambient noise of the party—laughter, clinking glasses, the murmur of diplomatic small talk. "The attaché's wife has strong opinions about Belgian chocolate."

"Copy that. You're doing great. Remember, two hours minimum before phase two."

"Two hours. Understood."

Max settled back in his chair, but his muscles refused to relax. The monitors showed Roxana moving through the crowd with Viktor, a vision of elegance and poise. No one watching would suspect she was memorizing faces, cataloging security positions, counting the minutes until she could slip away and betray the man whose arm she held.

"Long night ahead," Rodriguez said, pouring coffee from a thermos into a chipped mug. The bitter smell filled the van.

Max checked his watch. 7:47 PM. In approximately two hours and fifteen minutes, if everything went according to plan, Roxana would claim a headache and leave. She would enter Viktor's house alone. She would crack his safe and photograph enough classified intelligence to cripple Russian operations across Western Europe.

And if anything went wrong, she would be arrested, tortured, or simply disappear.

"Yeah," Max said, accepting the coffee Rodriguez offered. "Long night."

On the screen, Roxana tilted her head back and laughed at something Viktor whispered in her ear. The gesture looked natural, spontaneous, real. Max forced himself to look away, focusing instead on the security feeds, the equipment readouts, anything but the woman in the emerald dress who held his operation—and something more dangerous—in her hands.

Jenkins adjusted a dial, and Roxana's voice came through again, this time conversing in flawless Russian with someone off-camera. Max didn't speak the language, but he didn't need to. He could hear the confidence in her tone, the easy charm that made people trust her.

The van settled into tense silence, broken only by the hum of electronics and the occasional burst of static. Outside, Brussels lived its normal life. Inside, three men watched screens and waited, knowing that in the next few hours, everything could go perfectly right or catastrophically wrong.

Max's hand rested near the transmitter, ready to abort if he saw anything—anything at all—that suggested Roxana was in danger.

The operation had begun.

**Scene 2: Roxana navigates the diplomatic...**

**Scene 2: Roxana navigates the diplomatic reception**

The crystal chandeliers cast pools of golden light across the ballroom's marble floor, each fixture worth more than most people earned in a year. Roxana stood beside Viktor, her champagne flute held at precisely the right angle, her smile fixed in place like a porcelain mask. The French ambassador's wife was speaking—something about her daughter's upcoming wedding in Provence—and Roxana nodded at appropriate intervals, murmuring responses that required no actual thought.

"How wonderful," she said, watching the woman's lips move while her mind calculated minutes. Seven-thirty. She needed to wait until at least eight-fifteen. Too early would seem suspicious. Too late risked Viktor deciding to leave early himself.

Viktor's hand settled on the small of her back, possessive and warm through the silk of her emerald gown. "Darling, you remember Ambassador Demir?"

Roxana turned, extending her hand with practiced grace. "Of course. Ambassador, what a pleasure."

Demir's grip was firm, his smile diplomatic. "Mrs. Volkov. You look radiant this evening."

"You're too kind." The words came automatically, her tongue operating independently from her consciousness. Beneath the expensive fabric, sweat gathered between her shoulder blades. The phone Max had given her sat in her clutch purse, a small weight that felt heavy as lead.

Viktor launched into conversation about trade agreements, his voice taking on that particular timbre he used when networking—confident, charming, utterly false. Roxana had heard it a thousand times. She let the words wash over her, focusing instead on her breathing. In through the nose, slow and measured. Out through slightly parted lips, careful not to disturb her lipstick.

The ballroom hummed with conversation in a dozen languages. Waiters glided between clusters of guests, their trays laden with canapés and champagne. A string quartet played Vivaldi in the corner, the music barely audible above the din. Roxana caught fragments of conversations as they drifted past—the situation in the Middle East, commodity prices, someone's scandalous affair with a junior attaché.

"Don't you think, Roxana?"

She blinked, realizing Viktor had directed a question at her. Ambassador Demir watched her expectantly.

"I'm sorry," she said, touching her temple with two fingers. "I'm afraid I'm developing the most dreadful headache. The champagne, perhaps."

Viktor's eyes narrowed slightly—a microexpression that anyone else would have missed. But Roxana had spent five years learning to read those minute shifts in his features. Suspicion? Annoyance? She couldn't tell.

"Some water might help," Demir suggested kindly.

"Yes, of course." Viktor signaled a passing waiter with the efficiency of a man accustomed to immediate service. "Water for my wife."

The glass appeared in seconds, condensation already forming on the crystal. Roxana sipped, using the moment to check her watch. Seven-fifty-two. Close enough. She needed to plant the seed now, let it grow gradually.

"Thank you," she said, returning the glass to the waiter's tray. "I think I just need a moment. Please, don't let me interrupt."

Viktor's hand tightened on her waist. "Are you certain you're all right?"

"Just tired. It's been a long week." She leaned into him slightly, playing the dutiful wife seeking comfort. His cologne—something expensive and woody—filled her nostrils. Once, that scent had meant safety. Now it made her stomach turn.

They moved through the crowd, Viktor introducing her to a Romanian diplomat, then a British trade representative, then someone from the German embassy whose name she immediately forgot. Roxana performed her role flawlessly—the intelligent but not threatening wife, beautiful but not overshadowing, interested but not intrusive. She'd perfected this character over years of practice, molding herself into exactly what Viktor wanted.

What he needed.

What he could control.

Eight-oh-seven. The pain behind her eyes was becoming real now, born of stress and adrenaline rather than champagne. She pressed her fingers to her temple again, this time allowing a small wince to cross her features.

"Darling." She touched Viktor's sleeve lightly. "I'm so sorry, but the headache is getting worse."

He was mid-conversation with the Spanish ambassador, discussing something about shipping routes. His jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. "Can it wait? Ambassador Ruiz was just—"

"Of course." Roxana stepped back, her smile apologetic. "I'll just find somewhere quiet to sit."

She made it three steps before Viktor called her back. "Roxana."

Her heart stuttered. Had she miscalculated? Pushed too hard?

But when she turned, his expression showed only mild irritation. "Take the car. I'll catch a ride with Dmitri later."

"Are you certain? I don't want to inconvenience—"

"It's fine." He waved dismissively, already turning back to Ruiz. "Andrei will drive you. Go rest."

Roxana nodded, touching his arm in a gesture of wifely gratitude before making her way toward the exit. She moved slowly, stopping to say goodbye to two acquaintances, accepting sympathetic murmurs about her headache. Every instinct screamed at her to run, but she forced herself to maintain the elegant glide she'd perfected at finishing school.

The cool night air hit her face as she stepped outside, and she drew in a shaky breath. Andrei, their driver, was already pulling the car around—a black Mercedes that cost more than most people's houses.

The passenger door opened. Roxana slid inside, the leather seat cool against her bare shoulders. Through the tinted window, she could see the ballroom's golden glow, the silhouettes of guests moving like shadow puppets.

Viktor was in there, unsuspecting.

And she was heading to his study to commit treason.

"Home, Mrs. Volkov?" Andrei's voice came from the front seat.

Roxana closed her eyes, her hands clasped tightly in her lap to stop them shaking.

"Yes," she said quietly. "Home."

**Scene 3: Roxana claims a severe headache...**

The chandeliers of the embassy ballroom cast prismatic light across the sea of evening gowns and tuxedos, but Roxana saw only blurred shapes now. She pressed two fingers to her temple, letting her face go pale—not difficult when genuine nausea churned in her stomach.

"Viktor." She touched his arm lightly, interrupting his conversation with the French ambassador. "I'm so sorry, but I need to—"

He turned, irritation flashing across his features before he registered her expression. "What is it?"

"My head." She winced, making it real. "It came on so suddenly. The lights, the noise—I think it's a migraine."

Viktor's jaw tightened. The reception was critical for his cover, and her presence beside him lent legitimacy to his facade as a devoted husband. But other guests were already glancing their way, concern evident on their faces.

"You look terrible," the ambassador's wife murmured sympathetically.

Viktor's hand gripped Roxana's elbow, firm enough that she felt his displeasure through the silk of her gown. "I'll take you home."

"No." Roxana shook her head, immediately regretting the movement. "Please, you can't leave. The Austrian delegation hasn't even arrived yet. I'll just take the car. I have my medication at home."

He studied her face, searching for deception. Roxana held his gaze, willing herself not to look away, not to let fear show. After what felt like an eternity, he nodded curtly.

"Fine. Dmitri will drive you." He signaled to their driver, who materialized from his post near the entrance. "But call me when you arrive. I want to know you made it safely."

"Of course." Roxana managed a weak smile, already turning away. Each step toward the exit felt like wading through deep water.

The cool night air hit her face as she emerged from the embassy. Dmitri opened the rear door of the black Mercedes, and she slid inside, the leather seats creaking softly. Through the tinted window, she watched the illuminated building recede as they pulled away.

Her purse sat in her lap, innocent-looking, except for the phone Max had given her tucked inside. She could feel it there, a small weight that seemed to burn through the fabric.

The drive took seventeen minutes. Roxana counted each one, her pulse accelerating as familiar streets passed by. Their house rose before them, a modern fortress of glass and stone, every window dark.

"Thank you, Dmitri." She stepped out before he could open her door. "You should return to the embassy. Mr. Volkov may need the car."

The driver hesitated. "I was instructed to see you inside, Mrs. Volkov."

"I'm perfectly capable of walking to my own door." She softened her tone, adding a pained smile. "Please. The headache is worse, and I just need quiet and darkness."

Dmitri relented, waiting only until she'd unlocked the front door before pulling away. Roxana watched the taillights disappear down the drive, then stepped inside and closed the door.

Silence engulfed her.

The house felt cavernous, every shadow deeper than it should be. She kicked off her heels, leaving them by the door, and reached into her purse with trembling fingers. The phone's screen glowed to life.

A soft click in her ear made her jump before she remembered the tiny earpiece Max had insisted she wear, hidden beneath her upswept hair.

"I'm here." His voice was quiet, steady. "I've got you on GPS. You're doing great, Roxana."

She exhaled shakily, gripping the phone. "The driver's gone."

"I know. I watched him leave. You have the house to yourself." A pause. "How are you holding up?"

"Terrified," she whispered, moving through the foyer. Her stockinged feet made no sound on the marble floor.

"That's normal. Use it. Fear keeps you sharp." His voice wrapped around her like a tether to safety. "Take the hallway to your right. Viktor's study is the third door."

She knew the way—had walked it a hundred times—but everything looked different now. The abstract paintings on the walls seemed to watch her. The antique table where Viktor kept his keys cast strange shadows in the ambient light from the street.

"I'm at the door," she breathed.

"Good. Remember, you belong there. You're his wife. You have every right to be in that room."

But her hand shook as she turned the handle. The study door swung open on well-oiled hinges, revealing Viktor's domain. Mahogany desk. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. The scent of leather and his cologne.

And there, behind a reproduction of a Kandinsky painting—the safe.

"I see it," she said.

"Then let's do this." Max's voice held a note of tension now, the calm fraying at the edges. "You've got time, but not much. Move deliberately. Don't rush."

Roxana crossed to the painting, her reflection ghosting across the glass that protected it. She looked like a stranger—face too pale, eyes too wide, dressed for a party while committing treason.

The painting swung aside easily, revealing the safe's digital keypad. Her fingers hovered over the numbers.

"Roxana?" Max's voice pulled her back. "Talk to me."

"What if I'm wrong? What if the combination doesn't work?"

"Then we abort and try another time. But you're not wrong. Trust yourself."

She closed her eyes, remembering Viktor's fingers moving across the keypad, the pattern she'd memorized from a dozen stolen glances. Four digits. Two-seven-nine-three.

Roxana pressed the first number. The keypad beeped softly, the sound impossibly loud in the silent house.

Two.

Seven.

Nine.

Her finger trembled over the final digit.

Three.

A mechanical whir. A heavy click.

The safe door released.

"I'm in," she whispered, and heard Max's exhale of relief echo her own.

"Beautiful. Now photograph everything. Use the camera function on the phone I gave you. Make sure each image is clear—we won't get a second chance at this."

Roxana pulled the safe door open fully, and her breath caught. Files. Dozens of them, organized with military precision. She recognized some of the labels—NATO designations, technology codenames, strings of letters and numbers that meant nothing to her but would mean everything to Max's people.

She pulled out her phone and began to photograph, working methodically despite the tremor in her hands. Each click of the camera shutter seemed to seal her fate a little more completely.

Page after page. File after file. Lists of names—God, so many names. People who didn't know their covers were compromised, their lives documented in Viktor's meticulous handwriting.

"How much longer?" she asked, her voice barely audible.

"You're doing great. Keep going. Almost—"

Max's voice cut off mid-sentence.

Roxana froze. "Max?"

Static crackled in her ear, then his voice returned, sharp with urgency. "Roxana, I'm picking up a vehicle approaching the house. Fast."

Her heart stopped. "What?"

"It's a black Mercedes. Same make as yours. Roxana, I think it's Viktor."

The phone nearly slipped from her sweating palm. "That's impossible. He wouldn't leave the reception this early."

"I don't know what to tell you, but someone's coming up your drive right now, and they're moving like they have a purpose."

Through the study window, Roxana saw headlights sweep across the lawn.

"Finish photographing," Max said, his voice tight. "Right now. Whatever you haven't gotten, leave it. You need to close that safe and get out of there."

Her hands moved on autopilot, snapping pictures of the remaining files even as her mind screamed at her to run. The headlights grew brighter. A car door slammed.

"Safe closed. Painting back in place. I'm—"

The front door opened.

Roxana's breath stopped. She stood frozen in the center of Viktor's study, the phone still in her hand, as footsteps echoed through the foyer.

Heavy. Purposeful. Coming closer.

"Roxana." Max's voice was barely a whisper. "Hide the phone. Act natural. You're just looking for your medication, remember? You have a headache."

She shoved the phone into her clutch, her mind racing through excuses, explanations, anything that might—

The study door opened.

Viktor stood in the doorway, still in his tuxedo, his eyes cold and assessing as they swept

**Scene 4: Roxana's hands tremble as she w...**

**Scene 4: Roxana's hands tremble as she works the safe combination**

The mahogany-paneled study smelled of leather and Viktor's cologne—sandalwood and something sharper, medicinal. Roxana's fingers hovered over the safe's dial, the numbers Max had given her burning in her mind like a brand: 17-34-8-22.

Right to seventeen.

Her hand shook so badly the first time that she overshot the mark. The dial spun uselessly. She pulled back, pressing her palm against her thigh to steady it, feeling the silk of her evening gown stick to her sweat-dampened skin.

"Come on," she whispered to herself. "Come on."

She tried again. Seventeen. Left to thirty-four. Right to eight. Left to—

The dial slipped. Wrong again.

"Breathe," came Max's voice through the tiny earpiece, so quiet she almost missed it. He was watching through the camera hidden in her necklace, seeing everything she saw. "You have time. Viktor's still at the reception. Take your breath and try again."

Roxana closed her eyes, counted to three, opened them. The safe sat embedded in the wall behind a Kandinsky print she'd never liked—all chaotic angles and aggressive colors. How many times had she sat in this room, reading while Viktor worked, never knowing what secrets lived behind that painting?

Third attempt. Her fingers found their rhythm this time, muscle memory taking over where conscious thought had failed. Seventeen. Thirty-four. Eight. Twenty-two.

The lock clicked.

The sound seemed impossibly loud in the silent house. Roxana's heart hammered against her ribs as she pulled the heavy door open.

Inside, the safe was meticulously organized—so perfectly Viktor. Manila folders stood in neat rows, each labeled in his precise handwriting. USB drives in a velvet-lined case. A stack of passports bound with a rubber band. And there, on the top shelf, a leather portfolio embossed with the Russian Federation seal.

"Oh God," Roxana breathed.

"What do you see?" Max's voice was tight with urgency.

She pulled out the first folder with trembling hands. NATO DEPLOYMENT—EASTERN EUROPE. The tab read. Inside, detailed maps marked with troop positions, supply routes, defensive capabilities. Information that could get people killed.

The camera Max had given her was small enough to fit in her clutch, disguised as a compact. Roxana set it on Viktor's desk, angling it toward the documents, and began photographing. Click. Advance. Click. Advance. The mechanical rhythm steadied her breathing.

Second folder: TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITION—CLASSIFIED. Specifications for missile defense systems. Encryption protocols. Satellite imagery analysis.

"Faster," Max urged. "You're doing great, but move faster."

Roxana's hands found their efficiency, years of managing Viktor's household translating into methodical precision now. She worked through the folders systematically, photographing each page, returning them to their exact positions. The camera's tiny LED blinked green with each shot, a firefly pulse in the dim study.

She was reaching for the leather portfolio when her phone buzzed in her clutch.

Everything stopped.

The phone buzzed again. Not the secure phone Max had given her—her regular phone. Viktor's name glowed on the screen.

Roxana stared at it, paralyzed. He never called during receptions. Never.

"Don't answer," Max said. "Keep working."

But her hands had already frozen. The phone buzzed a third time, then fell silent. A moment later, a text appeared: *Coming home. Headache worse?*

The words blurred as Roxana read them. Her headache. The excuse she'd used to leave. He was checking on her.

Or he suspected.

"Roxana." Max's voice cut through her panic. "Listen to me. You have maybe ten minutes. Finish the portfolio and get out."

Ten minutes. She could do ten minutes.

Roxana opened the leather portfolio with shaking hands. Inside were lists—pages and pages of names, photographs, locations. Undercover operatives embedded across Europe and North America. She recognized some of the faces from diplomatic functions, people she'd smiled at, made small talk with, never knowing they were living double lives.

People like her, she realized. People pretending to be someone they weren't.

The camera clicked steadily as she photographed each page. Twenty names. Thirty. Forty-two in total. Each one a life in her hands.

"Last page," she whispered. "Almost done."

She was returning the portfolio to its shelf when she heard it—the distinctive purr of Viktor's Mercedes in the driveway.

Time stopped.

"Roxana, move." Max's voice was sharp now, commanding. "Close the safe. Hide the camera. Now."

Her hands obeyed before her mind could catch up. Portfolio back. Folders aligned. Safe door swung shut, dial spun. The Kandinsky swung back into place as headlights swept across the study window.

The camera. Where could she—

The antique globe in the corner. Roxana yanked open its hinged top—Viktor kept his best vodka inside—and dropped the camera among the bottles. It clinked against glass, too loud, but there was no time.

She heard the front door open.

Viktor's footsteps in the foyer, heavy and purposeful.

Roxana positioned herself by the window, one hand pressed to her temple, trying to look like a woman nursing a headache. Trying not to look like a woman who'd just committed treason.

The study door opened.

Viktor filled the doorway, his tuxedo jacket already removed, tie loosened. His pale eyes found her immediately, and Roxana saw something in them she'd never seen before.

Suspicion.

"Darling," he said, his voice soft and dangerous. "What are you doing in my study?"

**Scene 5: Roxana hears Viktor's car in th...**

**Scene 5: Roxana hears Viktor's car in the driveway**

The click of the safe's lock mechanism sliding into place sounded like a gunshot in the silent study.

Roxana's hands were still trembling against the cool metal when she heard it—the distinctive purr of Viktor's Mercedes turning into the driveway. Her blood turned to ice.

*No. No, no, no.*

He wasn't supposed to be back for another two hours. The reception was scheduled until midnight.

The camera. She snatched it from where it lay on Viktor's desk, her fingers fumbling with the small device. Where could she hide it? The desk drawer—no, he'd check there first. Behind the books—no time. Her evening clutch was too small.

Car doors slammed outside.

With shaking hands, Roxana shoved the camera into the hidden pocket of her dress, the one she'd had specially sewn into the silk lining. The hard edges pressed against her ribs, foreign and damning. She could feel her pulse hammering where the device touched her skin.

The front door opened downstairs.

She forced herself to breathe, to think. Why would she be in here? What excuse could possibly—

"Roxana!" Viktor's voice carried up the stairs, sharp with irritation.

She moved toward the door, each step measured, fighting every instinct that screamed at her to run. Her reflection caught in the window—pale, eyes too wide, a woman who looked exactly like someone who'd just been caught stealing state secrets.

Compose yourself. You're his wife. You belong here.

The study door swung open before she reached it.

Viktor filled the doorway, his broad shoulders blocking the light from the hallway. His tuxedo was still immaculate, but his face was flushed—from alcohol or anger, Roxana couldn't tell. His pale blue eyes swept the room before settling on her with an intensity that made her stomach drop.

"Viktor." She managed to keep her voice steady. "You're home early."

He didn't move from the doorway, didn't soften his expression. "I asked you a question downstairs." His Russian accent thickened when he was angry. "What are you doing in my study?"

The air in the room felt suddenly thin. Roxana's mind raced through possibilities, discarding them as quickly as they formed. The wrong answer here could cost her everything.

"I was looking for aspirin." The lie came out smooth, practiced. "My headache—I thought you might have some in your desk."

Viktor's eyes narrowed. He took a step into the room, and Roxana fought the urge to step back. Predators could sense fear.

"Aspirin." He said the word slowly, tasting it for truth. "In my private study. Not in any of the three bathrooms in this house. Not in the kitchen where we keep the medicine cabinet."

"I wasn't thinking clearly. The pain—"

"The safe is closed." Viktor's gaze shifted to the wall behind his desk, where the painting hung perfectly straight over the hidden safe. "I always leave it slightly ajar when I'm home. It's a habit."

Roxana's heart stopped.

"Did you touch it?" He moved closer, each footfall deliberate on the Persian rug. The smell of whiskey and expensive cologne preceded him. "Did you touch my safe, Roxana?"

The camera pressed against her ribs like a brand. If he searched her, if he found it, there would be no explanation that could save her. She thought of the photographs stored in its memory—NATO positions, classified documents, the names of operatives. Evidence of treason.

Evidence of her treason.

"I don't know the combination." True, until two hours ago. "Why would I touch your safe?"

Viktor stopped inches from her. Close enough that she could see the blood vessels in his eyes, the tight set of his jaw. Close enough that he could hear her heart pounding if he listened.

"That's what I'm asking you." His hand shot out and gripped her upper arm, fingers digging into the soft flesh. "Why are you really in here?"

The pain focused her. Roxana met his eyes, channeling every ounce of the rage and resentment she'd buried for five years of this marriage. It wasn't hard—the fury was always there, just beneath the surface.

"Let go of me."

"Answer the question."

"I told you—"

"You're lying." Viktor's other hand came up to her face, fingers gripping her chin, forcing her to maintain eye contact. "I can always tell when you're lying. Your left eye twitches. Just slightly. Right... there."

His thumb pressed against her cheekbone, and Roxana realized with crystalline clarity that she might die in this room. Viktor had killed before—she'd heard the whispers, seen the fear in the eyes of men who crossed him. What was one more body, even if it belonged to his wife?

Especially if that wife was a traitor.

"The reception," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Why did you leave early?"

Something flickered across Viktor's face—surprise, perhaps, that she'd dared to ask. His grip loosened fractionally.

"Dimitri called. Said there was suspicious activity on our network. Someone trying to access classified files." His eyes searched her face. "Strange timing, don't you think? The same night you suddenly develop a headache and leave early?"

The room tilted. They knew. Somehow, they knew.

Viktor's phone buzzed in his pocket. He ignored it, but it buzzed again. And again.

With a curse, he released Roxana and pulled out the phone. His face went rigid as he read the screen.

"Get out," he said quietly.

"What?"

"Get out of my study. Now. We'll finish this conversation later." But his attention was already on the phone, his fingers flying across the screen.

Roxana didn't wait for him to change his mind. She walked past him on legs that felt disconnected from her body, through the doorway, into the hall. Every step away from that room felt like a miracle.

She made it to the stairs before her knees buckled.

Behind her, she heard Viktor's voice, low and deadly, speaking rapid Russian into his phone. She caught only fragments: "...breach...trace it...find them..."

The camera burned against her ribs.

She had to get out. Had to get the files to Max. Had to—

Her phone vibrated in her clutch. A single word from Max: *ABORT.*

Too late for that.

Roxana descended the stairs, each step taking her deeper into a nightmare from which there would be no waking.

**Scene 6: Max listens helplessly through...**

The surveillance van smelled of stale coffee and electrical components. Max sat rigid in the cramped space, headphones pressed against his ears, listening to the silence from Roxana's earpiece. The monitors before him showed thermal imaging of Viktor's house—two heat signatures in the study, one significantly larger than the other.

His finger trembled over the red emergency extraction button.

"Roxana?" Viktor's voice crackled through the connection, sharp with suspicion. "What are you doing in here?"

Max's stomach dropped. Through the audio feed, he heard Roxana's sharp intake of breath.

"Viktor." Her voice wavered—perfectly calibrated fear, Max realized. "I... I was looking for aspirin. The headache, it's worse than I thought."

"Aspirin." Viktor's footsteps echoed on hardwood. "In my study."

"I couldn't find any in the bathroom. I thought maybe you kept some in your desk." A pause. "I'm sorry, I should have called you first."

Max's hand hovered millimeters from the extraction button. His other hand gripped the edge of the console so hard his knuckles had gone white. The thermal imaging showed Viktor moving closer to Roxana. Closer to the safe.

"You look flushed," Viktor said, his tone softening slightly. "Come, let me see you."

Through the earpiece, Max heard the rustle of fabric, footsteps. He imagined Viktor's hands on Roxana's face, those same hands that had left bruises Max had photographed weeks ago. His jaw clenched.

"Your pupils are dilated," Viktor observed. "Perhaps you should sit down."

"I just need the aspirin. Then I'll go to bed."

"The medicine cabinet is in the master bathroom. You know this." Viktor's voice hardened again. "Why would you come to my study?"

Max's finger pressed against the button, not quite activating it. His heart hammered against his ribs. The extraction team was three minutes out. Three minutes that might as well be three hours.

"I told you—I got confused. The headache, it's making me disoriented." Roxana's breathing quickened. "Viktor, you're scaring me."

A long silence. Max could hear his own pulse in his ears, could feel sweat trickling down his spine despite the van's air conditioning. On the thermal display, Viktor's heat signature remained motionless, a predator assessing prey.

"Sit," Viktor commanded.

The sound of Roxana settling into a chair. Viktor's footsteps moved across the room. Max's eyes tracked the thermal signature—heading directly toward the safe.

*No. No, no, no.*

Max's finger depressed the button halfway. One more ounce of pressure and the extraction team would breach the house. Roxana would be blown. Their entire network would be compromised. But she'd be alive.

The footsteps stopped.

"This safe," Viktor said slowly. "Has it been touched?"

Max's vision tunneled. He couldn't breathe. Through the headphones, he heard Roxana's response, each word crystalline in its terror.

"I don't know what you mean. Viktor, please, my head—"

"The dial. It's warm."

The world reduced to that single point of contact between Max's finger and the button. His entire body screamed at him to press it, to get her out, to hell with the mission. But he'd trained for this. They both had. Trust your asset. Trust the plan.

He couldn't do either.

"Maybe from the heat in the room?" Roxana's voice cracked. "I don't understand why you're interrogating me."

"Stand up."

Max heard her comply. The thermal signatures merged—Viktor standing directly in front of her now. His hand moved, and Roxana made a small sound of pain.

Max pressed the button.

"Wait." Roxana's voice cut through, urgent but controlled. "Wait, I remember. Earlier today, I was in here. You were at the office. I was looking for our marriage certificate—for the insurance paperwork. I must have touched the safe then. I'm sorry, I should have asked permission."

Max's finger froze. The button sat depressed but not fully activated—a hair's breadth from triggering the extraction.

"Insurance paperwork," Viktor repeated flatly.

"For my new doctor. The neurologist you insisted I see about the headaches. They needed proof of marriage for the coverage." She paused. "You don't remember? You told me to handle it last week."

The silence stretched so long Max wondered if his audio feed had died. Then Viktor laughed—a cold, humorless sound.

"Of course. The neurologist." Another pause. "I'll get you the aspirin. Stay here."

Viktor's heat signature moved toward the door. In the van, Max slowly released pressure on the button, his hand shaking so violently he had to grip his wrist to steady it. The extraction team's voice crackled in his other ear: "Command, do we have a go?"

"Stand down," Max whispered. "Repeat, stand down."

Through the earpiece, he heard Roxana's breathing—rapid, shallow, alive. Viktor's footsteps receded down the hallway. For now, she was safe.

For now.

Max slumped back in his chair, adrenaline making his muscles twitch. On the monitor, Roxana's heat signature remained motionless in the study, a lone figure in the darkness. He watched her for a long moment, then reached for his phone.

The message he typed was simple: *We need to pull you out. Tonight.*

But even as he wrote it, he knew she wouldn't agree. Not with those files still in the safe. Not with Viktor's network still operational.

Not while she still had something to prove.

Max deleted the message unsent and returned his attention to the monitors, settling in for what promised to be the longest night of his life.

## Chapter 9: Exposed

**Scene 1: Viktor catches Roxana in his st...**

**Scene 1: Viktor catches Roxana in his study**

The drawer was still open when Roxana heard the footsteps.

Her heart seized. The polished mahogany desk suddenly felt like a trap, the leather-bound ledgers and folders fanned before her like evidence at a crime scene. She'd been so focused on photographing the documents—the miniature camera still warm in her trembling palm—that she hadn't heard the study door open.

"Roxana."

Viktor's voice cut through the room's heavy silence like a blade through silk.

She spun around, her hip catching the edge of the desk. The drawer rattled. In that fraction of a second, she saw his eyes—those pale blue eyes that had once looked at her with something resembling affection—track from her face to her hands to the open drawer behind her.

"Viktor." She forced her voice to remain steady, even as her pulse hammered against her throat. "I didn't hear you come in."

He stood in the doorway, still wearing his charcoal suit from dinner, his tie loosened but not removed. The hallway light behind him cast his face in shadow, making it impossible to read his expression. But she could feel his suspicion radiating across the Persian rug that separated them.

"What are you doing in here?" His accent thickened slightly—it always did when he was angry or aroused. Right now, she prayed it was neither.

Roxana slipped the camera into her cardigan pocket with what she hoped looked like a casual gesture, then pressed her hand against her temple. "I have a terrible headache. I was looking for aspirin." She gestured vaguely toward the desk. "I thought you might have some in your drawer."

Viktor didn't move. Didn't blink. The grandfather clock in the corner ticked five times before he took a step into the room.

"Aspirin." He repeated the word as if tasting it, testing it for poison.

"Yes." Roxana moved away from the desk, putting distance between herself and the incriminating evidence. Her legs felt liquid, unreliable. "I checked the bathroom cabinets first, but—"

"The medicine is in the kitchen." Viktor's voice was soft now, dangerously soft. He took another step forward. "You know this. You organized the cabinets yourself last month."

The study suddenly felt smaller. The walls—lined with books Viktor had never read, art he'd purchased for status rather than beauty—seemed to press inward. The scent of his cologne and old leather and something else, something metallic like fear, filled her nostrils.

"I forgot." She tried to laugh, but it came out wrong, strangled. "I wasn't thinking clearly. The headache—"

"Close the drawer, Roxana."

It wasn't a request.

She turned, her hands shaking now in a way she couldn't control, and pushed the drawer shut. The soft click of wood against wood sounded like a gunshot in the quiet room.

When she faced him again, Viktor had moved closer. Close enough that she could see the muscle working in his jaw. Close enough to see that his eyes had gone cold and flat, the way they looked in photographs from his military service, from before he'd learned to play the respectable businessman.

"Your hands are shaking." He observed this clinically, without warmth. "Are you nervous, my dear?"

"The headache—"

"Show me your pockets."

The world tilted. Roxana's mouth went dry.

"Viktor, this is ridiculous. I was just—"

"Show. Me. Your. Pockets." Each word dropped like a stone into still water.

The camera in her cardigan pocket felt like it weighed a thousand pounds. Her phone—with its panic signal, with Max on the other end—was in her other pocket. She had seconds to decide. Seconds to choose between maintaining the lie and triggering the alarm that would bring everything crashing down ahead of schedule.

Viktor's hand shot out and gripped her arm, his fingers digging into the soft flesh above her elbow. The sudden violence of it made her gasp.

"I asked you a question." His face was inches from hers now, and she could smell the brandy on his breath, see the tiny broken capillaries in the whites of his eyes. "What were you really looking for in my desk?"

The clock ticked. Her heart hammered. And in Viktor's eyes, she saw the exact moment when suspicion crystallized into certainty.

He knew.

**Scene 2: Viktor grabs Roxana's arm viole...**

**Scene 2: Viktor grabs Roxana's arm violently**

The words died on Roxana's lips as Viktor's hand shot out, his fingers clamping around her wrist like a vise. The force of his grip sent a jolt of pain up her arm, and she gasped, her carefully constructed excuse evaporating in the sudden violence of his movement.

"Don't lie to me," he hissed, yanking her toward him. The scent of whiskey on his breath mingled with his cologne—a smell that had once been comforting, now turned acrid with menace. "You think I'm stupid? You think I don't know when my own wife is lying?"

Roxana's heart hammered against her ribs. The study seemed to contract around them, the mahogany walls pressing in, the leather-bound books bearing witness to her unraveling. "Viktor, you're hurting me—"

"Aspirin." His laugh was sharp, brittle. "In my locked desk. At two in the morning." His free hand moved to her jacket pocket, and Roxana felt her blood turn to ice.

"No—wait—" She tried to pull away, but his grip only tightened. Her bones ground together beneath his fingers.

Viktor's hand plunged into her pocket. Time seemed to slow as his fingers closed around the miniature camera—no larger than a button, but damning as a loaded gun. He pulled it out, holding it up to the lamplight. For a moment, he simply stared at it, his face unreadable.

Then understanding dawned, and with it, fury.

"You—" The word came out strangled. His face flushed crimson, the veins in his neck standing out like cables. "You've been spying on me? In my own house? My own *wife*?"

"Viktor, please, let me explain—"

The slap came without warning. His palm connected with her cheek, the crack echoing off the walls like a gunshot. White-hot pain exploded across her face, and she stumbled backward, catching herself against the desk. The metallic taste of blood filled her mouth.

"How long?" Viktor's voice had dropped to something worse than shouting—a cold, deadly calm. He advanced on her, still clutching the camera. "How long have you been betraying me?"

Roxana's hand moved instinctively toward her other pocket, where her phone waited. The panic signal. She just needed to reach it. Her fingers trembled as they slipped inside.

"Answer me!" Viktor grabbed her by the shoulders, shaking her hard enough to rattle her teeth. The lamp on his desk flickered, casting wild shadows across his contorted features. This wasn't the man she'd married, the one who'd courted her with poetry and promises. This was someone else entirely—someone capable of anything.

"I—" Roxana's thumb found the phone's edge, sliding along its surface, searching for the button. "I didn't have a choice—"

"There's always a choice." His grip shifted to her throat, not quite squeezing, but the threat implicit in the placement of his fingers. "Who are you working for? CIA? FBI?"

The pressure on her windpipe made speech difficult. Black spots danced at the edges of her vision. Her thumb finally found the panic button—three quick presses. Click-click-click. Silent. Invisible. A lifeline cast into the darkness.

Please let Max be monitoring. Please let him see it.

Viktor's eyes narrowed. "What did you just do?" He shoved her backward, and she crashed into the bookshelf behind her. Leather spines dug into her spine. A heavy volume tumbled to the floor with a thud.

"Nothing—I didn't—"

He was on her again, his hand diving into her other pocket, extracting the phone. His eyes scanned the screen, and Roxana saw the exact moment he understood. The panic signal had gone through. A small icon pulsed in the corner—a beacon she couldn't hide.

"No." Viktor's voice dropped to a whisper. "No, no, no."

He hurled the phone against the wall. It shattered, pieces scattering across the Persian rug like shrapnel. Then he turned back to Roxana, and what she saw in his eyes made her stomach drop.

"You've destroyed everything," he said softly. "Do you understand that? Everything we built. Everything I worked for."

He moved toward the desk, toward the locked drawer where she knew he kept his gun. Roxana's mind raced, calculating distances, escape routes. The door was ten feet away. The window behind her, double-paned and alarmed. Viktor stood between her and freedom.

"Viktor, wait—" She held up her hands, palms out. "They made me do it. They have evidence—fabricated evidence—they said they'd destroy me if I didn't cooperate."

He paused, his hand hovering over the drawer. "Evidence of what?"

"Financial crimes. They doctored documents, made it look like I was embezzling from my own foundation." The lie came smoothly, desperately. She'd prepared for this possibility, though she'd prayed it would never come. "They said they'd send me to prison unless I helped them."

Viktor's jaw worked. She could see him thinking, weighing, calculating. For a man like him, betrayal wasn't just personal—it was strategic. And strategy could be manipulated.

"I can fix this," Roxana pressed, tasting blood on her split lip. "I can be more useful to you working with them. I can feed them false information. Viktor, please—we can turn this around."

His hand remained on the drawer pull. Outside, a car passed on the street, its headlights briefly illuminating the room before plunging it back into shadow. The grandfather clock in the hall chimed once. Two-thirty.

How long until Max arrived? Fifteen minutes? Twenty? An eternity in this moment.

Viktor's fingers tightened on the drawer pull, and Roxana braced herself for what came next.

**Scene 3: As Viktor makes urgent phone c...**

**Scene 3: As Viktor makes urgent phone calls**

Viktor's voice cut through the study like shattered glass—sharp, rapid bursts of Russian that Roxana couldn't fully follow but understood in her bones. He'd moved to the far corner of the room, phone pressed to his ear, his free hand gesturing violently as he spoke. The miniature camera sat on his desk between them like an accusation, its tiny lens catching the lamplight.

Roxana's cheek throbbed where he'd struck her. She could taste copper on her tongue. Her phone was still in her jacket pocket, and while Viktor's attention was diverted by his call, she slipped her hand inside, fingers trembling as they found the device. The panic signal was a specific sequence—volume up, volume down, power button three times in rapid succession. She'd practiced it a hundred times in training, never imagining the sick terror that would accompany actually using it.

*Click. Click. Click.*

Done. Max would know. Fifteen minutes, maybe twenty if traffic was bad. She needed to survive that long.

Viktor ended his call with a curt phrase and turned back to her, his eyes cold and calculating. The rage had crystallized into something worse—controlled fury, the kind that made decisions.

"Viktor, please—" Roxana started, but he raised a hand.

"Do not speak unless I tell you to speak." He picked up the camera, turning it over in his palm. "Who are you working for? CIA? FBI?"

This was it. The lie had to be perfect.

Roxana let her shoulders sag, let tears—real ones, born of genuine fear—spill down her cheeks. "I didn't have a choice," she whispered. "They have... they fabricated evidence against me. Financial crimes, connections to Russian oligarchs. They said they'd destroy everything—my career, my reputation, my life—unless I cooperated."

Viktor's expression didn't change, but she saw something flicker in his eyes. Interest, perhaps. Or calculation.

"They approached me six months ago," she continued, the words tumbling out in a rush that sounded authentic because her terror was authentic. "After I started seeing you. They said they knew about us, that they could use it. I told them no at first, but they showed me the documents they'd created. Bank transfers that never happened. Emails I never sent. It looked... God, Viktor, it looked real."

"Which agency?" His voice was ice.

"FBI counterintelligence. A man named Harper, though I don't think that's his real name." She was pulling details from old case files, mixing truth with fiction. "They wanted information about your business dealings, your contacts in Moscow. I gave them nothing important—just surface details they could have found themselves."

Viktor moved closer, and Roxana fought the urge to recoil. The study suddenly felt suffocatingly small, the mahogany walls closing in. The smell of his cologne—something expensive and woody—mixed with the leather scent of the furniture and her own fear-sweat.

"And the camera?"

"They insisted. Said they needed proof I was trying, or they'd activate the evidence." Roxana met his eyes, forcing herself to hold his gaze. "But Viktor, listen to me. This could work in your favor."

His eyebrow raised fractionally. "Explain."

"I can feed them false information. Become a double agent." The words felt surreal coming from her mouth, a spy novel plot she was improvising in real time. "You control what they learn. We can use their operation against them. I'll tell them you suspect nothing, that I'm gaining your trust. Meanwhile, you feed me exactly what you want them to hear."

Viktor was silent for a long moment, studying her face with the intensity of a man who'd spent a lifetime reading people, detecting lies, calculating angles. The grandfather clock in the corner ticked steadily, each second an eternity.

Outside, a car passed on the street. Normal life, continuing obliviously.

"You expect me to believe," Viktor said slowly, "that you would betray your own government?"

"They betrayed me first." Roxana injected bitterness into her voice, thinking of every case that had gone wrong, every bureaucratic failure, every time the system had let her down. It wasn't hard to sound convincing. "I'm a lawyer, Viktor. I understand leverage. Right now, I have none with them. But with you... if we work together, we both win. You neutralize their operation, and I get my life back."

Viktor's phone buzzed. He glanced at it, then back at her, his jaw tight. Another call in Russian, this one shorter, more clipped. When he hung up, his expression had hardened again.

"My people are coming," he said. "They will want to ask you questions. Different kinds of questions."

Roxana's blood turned to ice water. She thought of the panic signal, of Max racing through D.C. traffic. How many minutes had passed? Five? Seven?

"That's a mistake," she said, keeping her voice steady through sheer force of will. "If I disappear, Harper will know something went wrong. The FBI will be all over you within hours. But if I go back, if I play along..." She let the implication hang.

Viktor picked up his phone again, but didn't dial. His thumb hovered over the screen.

The study's silence pressed against Roxana's eardrums. She could hear her own heartbeat, feel the pulse in her bruised cheek. The miniature camera sat between them like a ticking bomb.

"Tell me something," Viktor said finally. "Something they don't know. Prove you're willing to cross that line."

Roxana's mind raced. She needed to give him something, but not too much. Something that sounded significant but wouldn't compromise actual operations.

Before she could answer, she heard it—faint but distinct. The sound of a car door closing outside, too quiet, too controlled. Not Viktor's people.

Max.

She had seconds to decide: keep playing the double agent angle, or prepare for the chaos about to erupt.

Viktor heard it too. His eyes narrowed, and his hand moved toward the desk drawer where she knew he kept a gun.

**Scene 4: Max receives Roxana's panic sig...**

**Scene 4: Max receives Roxana's panic signal while fifteen minutes away**

The vibration against Max's ribs felt like a defibrillator shock.

He was reaching for his coffee when the phone buzzed—three short pulses, pause, three more. The panic signal. Roxana's panic signal.

The paper cup hit the dashboard, brown liquid exploding across the console. Max didn't notice. His hand was already moving, yanking the phone from his jacket, thumbs flying across the encrypted app even as his other hand slammed the gear shift into drive.

The tracker showed a stationary red dot. Still at the Volkov residence.

"Fuck." The word came out quiet, deadly calm.

He punched the accelerator, the sedan lurching forward into traffic. Horns blared. Max cut across two lanes, his mind already three steps ahead, calculating routes, response times, contingencies.

Fifteen minutes. He was fifteen goddamn minutes away.

His earpiece crackled to life. "Carter."

"Signal received," Max said, his voice flat, professional, betraying nothing of the ice water flooding his veins. "Operation compromised. I need immediate extraction at the Volkov residence. How fast can you mobilize?"

"Rodriguez and I are eight minutes out from the safe house. We can be armed and rolling in ten."

"Make it eight. Meet me two blocks south of the target. Come heavy."

"Copy that."

The line went silent, but Max kept the channel open. His eyes flicked between the road and the tracker on his phone, mounted now on the dashboard. The red dot hadn't moved. Roxana was still inside.

*Still alive*, he told himself. *She's still transmitting.*

He took a corner too fast, tires screaming against asphalt. A taxi swerved, driver shouting something Max didn't hear. The city blurred past—streetlights, storefronts, pedestrians jerking back from the curb. Everything reduced to obstacles between him and that red dot.

His hands were steady on the wheel, but his jaw ached from clenching. He forced himself to breathe, to think tactically. Viktor Volkov wasn't some street thug. Former SVR, connected, paranoid. If he'd caught Roxana with evidence, he wouldn't hesitate.

The image of her face flashed through Max's mind—that slight tremor in her smile when she'd left for the dinner party, the way she'd touched his arm and said, "See you soon."

He'd let her walk in there. He'd sent her in there.

"Monroe." Rodriguez's voice cut through his thoughts. "We're loading now. What's the play?"

Max's eyes tracked the GPS, recalculating. Thirteen minutes now. Still too long.

"Silent approach, two-block perimeter. I'll provide real-time intel from the tracker. We breach on my signal—front and rear simultaneously. Volkov is SVR-trained, assume he's armed. Priority one is getting Roxana out alive."

"Rules of engagement?"

Max's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. "Whatever it takes."

"Copy."

The sedan rocketed through a yellow light, the intersection a blur of color and motion. Max's training kept his breathing even, his movements precise, but underneath the professional veneer, something darker churned. He'd run dozens of extractions, pulled assets from hostile situations across three continents. This was just another op.

Except it wasn't.

His phone screen glowed in the darkness of the car. The red dot pulsed like a heartbeat. *Roxana's* heartbeat.

"Carter, what's your ETA?"

"Six minutes to rendezvous point."

Six minutes for them. Eleven for him. An eternity.

Max cut through a narrow side street, barely wide enough for the sedan. Brick walls flew past on either side, close enough to scrape paint. He emerged onto a main thoroughfare, accelerating hard.

The tracker app showed no movement. Roxana hadn't tried to run. Either she couldn't, or she was playing it smart, keeping Viktor talking. Buying time.

*Hold on*, he thought. *Just hold on.*

His earpiece crackled. "Monroe, Rodriguez. We're armed and mobile. En route to rendezvous."

"Confirmed. Radio silence from here until breach. Maintain encrypted channel only."

"Copy."

Max's mind raced through the layout of the Volkov residence. He'd memorized the floor plans weeks ago—exits, sight lines, potential choke points. Viktor's study was on the second floor, northeast corner. Two staircases, one front, one rear. Windows overlooking the garden.

Options. He needed options.

The sedan's engine roared as he pushed it harder, weaving through traffic with surgical precision. Nine minutes now. Every second mattered. Every second Roxana was in there with Viktor, the situation could deteriorate.

He'd seen what happened to compromised assets. The interrogations. The reprisals.

His jaw clenched tighter.

Red light ahead. Max didn't slow. He checked the mirrors, calculated the crossing traffic, and shot through the intersection. More horns. More angry shouts dissolving into the night behind him.

The tracker showed the red dot still stationary.

*Still there. Still transmitting.*

But for how long?

Max's fingers drummed once against the steering wheel—the only outward sign of the controlled fury building in his chest. Then his hands steadied, his face hardening into the mask he wore in the field. Emotion was a liability. Emotion got people killed.

He'd save Roxana first. Feel later.

The city lights streaked past, and Max drove faster into the darkness, counting down the minutes, the seconds, until he could bring her home.

Or burn down everything trying.

**Scene 5: Viktor wavers between killing ...**

**Scene 5: Viktor wavers between killing Roxana immediately and exploiting her offer**

The silence stretched like a wire pulled taut, ready to snap.

Viktor stood motionless, the miniature camera still pinched between his thumb and forefinger. His other hand gripped his phone, the screen dark now, the rapid-fire Russian conversation concluded. Roxana couldn't breathe. Couldn't think beyond the metallic taste of blood in her mouth and the throbbing pain radiating from her split lip.

The study felt smaller now, the walls pressing in. The antique clock on the bookshelf ticked with obscene loudness—each second a countdown she couldn't afford. How long since she'd triggered the panic signal? Three minutes? Four? Max was fifteen minutes away. She had to survive eleven more.

Maybe twelve.

Viktor's jaw worked, muscles flexing beneath his skin. His eyes—those gray eyes she'd once found distinguished, even handsome—were flat and cold as January ice.

"Blackmail," he said finally, the word dropping into the silence like a stone into still water. "You expect me to believe American intelligence is blackmailing *you*? My wife?"

Roxana forced herself to meet his gaze, even as her hands trembled. She pressed one palm against the edge of his desk to steady herself, feeling the polished mahogany slick beneath her sweating fingers.

"They fabricated documents." Her voice cracked, and she let it—let the fear show because it was real, and maybe that would make the lie more convincing. "Financial records. They made it look like I'd been embezzling from the foundation. Said they'd destroy me, destroy my reputation, unless I—"

"Unless you spied on me." Viktor's laugh was sharp, humorless. He set the camera down on the desk with exaggerated care, as if it were a chess piece he was considering. "How convenient. How perfectly constructed."

He moved closer, and Roxana's spine pressed against the desk. The lamp cast his shadow long across the Persian rug, swallowing her in darkness.

"Viktor, please—"

"Do you know what they do to traitors in Moscow?" His voice was conversational now, almost gentle. That terrified her more than the rage. "My contacts will be here in twenty minutes. Maybe less. They'll have questions. Many, many questions."

Twenty minutes. The Russians would arrive before Max.

Roxana's mind raced, cataloging possibilities, discarding them just as quickly. The letter opener on the desk—too far. The heavy crystal paperweight—she'd never reach it in time. The door—locked from the inside, and Viktor stood between her and it.

"I can be useful to you," she said, the words tumbling out. "Think about it. They trust me now. I can feed them whatever you want. Disinformation. False leads. I can—"

"You can die." Viktor's hand shot out, fingers closing around her throat. Not squeezing—not yet—but the threat was clear in the pressure of his thumb against her windpipe. "That would be simpler. Cleaner."

Her pulse hammered against his palm. She could feel it, wild and desperate, a trapped bird beating its wings. The study tilted, and she gripped the desk harder, knuckles white.

"But perhaps..." Viktor's eyes narrowed, calculation flickering behind the rage. "Perhaps you're right. A double agent could be valuable. If you're truly compromised, if they truly believe they own you..."

Hope flared, sharp and painful. Roxana nodded as much as his grip allowed. "Yes. Exactly. I can—"

"Show me your phone."

The hope guttered out.

"My phone?"

"Now, Roxana." His fingers tightened fractionally. "Unless you'd prefer I search you myself."

Her phone was in her jacket pocket, the panic signal already sent. If he looked at it, he'd see the alert, see the emergency message to Max. Game over.

The clock ticked. Eight minutes, maybe. Seven.

"I left it in the bedroom," she lied, and watched his expression darken.

Viktor's free hand moved to her jacket, patting the pockets. She felt the moment his fingers found the phone's rectangular outline. Felt the shift in his breathing, the subtle tension in his shoulders.

"You left it in the bedroom," he repeated softly.

He pulled the phone free, and Roxana's heart stopped. His thumb moved toward the screen, toward the fingerprint sensor that would unlock it and reveal everything.

Then—a sound. Distant but distinct. The low rumble of an engine on the street outside, moving fast.

Viktor's head snapped toward the window, his grip on her throat loosening just slightly. Roxana sucked in air, her vision clearing enough to see his expression shift from calculation to suspicion to something harder.

Understanding.

"How long ago?" he asked, his voice deadly quiet.

"I don't—"

"How long ago did you signal them?" He released her throat and grabbed her wrist instead, twisting until she gasped. "How long, Roxana?"

The engine sound grew louder. Closer.

Viktor's phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, and his face went white with fury. "They're not coming," he said, and Roxana realized he meant his Russian contacts. "The Americans are jamming communications in the area. How long have they been—"

Glass shattered somewhere downstairs.

Viktor's hand went to his waistband, pulling out a pistol Roxana had never known he carried. The sight of it—black, compact, utterly real—made her legs go weak.

"Get down," he snarled, shoving her toward the floor behind the desk. "Now."

Footsteps pounded up the stairs. Multiple sets. Fast and tactical.

Viktor moved to the door, weapon raised, and Roxana pressed herself against the desk's solid bulk, her ears ringing, her breath coming in short, sharp gasps.

The doorknob rattled.

Then the shooting started.

**Scene 6: Max and his extraction team br...**

**Scene 6: Max and his extraction team breach the Volkov residence**

The front door exploded inward with a concussive blast that sent splinters of mahogany spinning through the foyer. Max was through the smoke before the echo faded, his Glock 19 raised, eyes scanning the marble-floored entrance hall with predatory focus.

"Go, go, go!"

Carter swept left, Rodriguez right, their suppressed weapons coughing as Viktor's security personnel emerged from the east wing. The first guard went down with two rounds to the chest, the second diving behind a marble column as bullets chipped stone and sent white dust cascading through the air.

Max didn't slow. He'd studied the floor plans during the drive over, his hands white-knuckled on the steering wheel while his team loaded magazines and checked body armor. The study was northwest, second floor. Roxana's panic signal had gone silent three minutes ago—three minutes that felt like hours compressed into razor-sharp seconds.

"Study, northwest!" he barked into his throat mic, taking the curved staircase two steps at a time.

Behind him, Carter's weapon barked again, followed by the wet thud of a body hitting marble. "First floor clear!"

The second-floor hallway stretched before Max like a tunnel, Persian runners muffling his footfalls. Portraits of stern-faced Volkov ancestors watched him pass, their painted eyes judging. He didn't care. The only thing that mattered was the closed door at the end of the hall, ornate and heavy, and what might be happening behind it.

A guard rounded the corner ahead, raising an AK-47. Max fired twice, center mass, then once more as the man fell. No hesitation. No mercy. Not tonight.

He reached the study door and heard voices inside—Viktor's cultured baritone, tight with fury, and Roxana's voice, higher, strained. She was alive. The relief that flooded through him was immediately crushed beneath tactical necessity.

Rodriguez appeared at his shoulder, breathing hard. "Breach?"

Max shook his head, hand on the doorknob. Surprise over force. He turned it slowly, finding it unlocked, then kicked it open and went in low.

The scene burned into his retinas: Viktor behind his desk, phone in one hand, pistol in the other. Roxana on the floor near the leather chair, blood trickling from her split lip, her eyes wide with terror and something else—determination. The miniature camera lay smashed on the desk between them.

Viktor's gun swung toward Max.

Max fired first. The round caught Viktor in the shoulder, spinning him backward. The phone clattered across the desk as Viktor's pistol discharged into the ceiling, plaster raining down like snow.

"Roxana, down!" Max advanced into the room, Rodriguez covering the door behind him.

But Roxana was already moving, scrambling away from Viktor as he clutched his shoulder, red seeping between his fingers. His face was a mask of rage and calculation, even in pain.

"You're making a mistake," Viktor hissed, his accent thicker now. "Do you know who I am? Who I work with?"

"Yeah," Max said, keeping the Glock trained on Viktor's chest. "I know exactly who you are."

Gunfire erupted from the hallway—Carter's voice crackling over the radio: "More hostiles, coming up the east stairs!"

Viktor smiled through his pain, a predator's expression. "You won't leave here alive."

Max moved to Roxana, never taking his eyes off Viktor. She was shaking, her dress torn at the shoulder, a bruise already darkening her cheekbone. When he touched her arm, she flinched, then grabbed his hand so tightly her nails dug into his skin.

"I'm okay," she whispered, but her voice betrayed her. "Max, he knows. He knows everything."

"Doesn't matter." He pulled her to her feet, positioning himself between her and Viktor. "Can you walk?"

"Yes."

Viktor laughed, a bitter sound. "Touching. The American hero and his recruited whore. You think this ends here? You think—"

Max's fist connected with Viktor's jaw before he could finish, a sharp crack that sent the older man sprawling across his desk. The gun fell from Viktor's hand, and Rodriguez kicked it away.

"Zip him," Max ordered, already moving Roxana toward the door.

The hallway was chaos. Two more of Viktor's security team lay motionless on the runner, and Carter was engaged with a third near the staircase, the two men grappling for control of a knife. Max fired once, dropping the hostile, and Carter nodded his thanks.

"Exfil, now!" Max commanded.

They moved as a unit, Max with Roxana tucked against his side, her arm around his waist. She stumbled on the stairs, and he caught her, practically lifting her down the steps. Behind them, Rodriguez emerged from the study, Viktor zip-tied and being dragged along, still conscious, still cursing in Russian.

The foyer was a war zone—overturned furniture, bullet holes in the walls, blood on the marble. Max's mind catalogued it all automatically, threat assessment running on autopilot while his focus narrowed to a single imperative: get Roxana out.

They burst through the shattered front door into the cold night air. The extraction van idled at the curb, rear doors open, engine running. Max could hear sirens in the distance—police, probably, responding to reports of gunfire in this upscale neighborhood.

"Go, go!" He pushed Roxana toward the van, and she climbed in, turning immediately to look back at him with those dark eyes that had haunted him since the day they'd recruited her.

Carter and Rodriguez threw Viktor into the van after her, then jumped in themselves. Max was last, slamming the doors shut as the driver hit the gas.

The van lurched forward, tires squealing. Max fell into the seat beside Roxana, breathing hard, adrenaline still singing through his veins. She was staring at him, tears cutting tracks through the dust and blood on her face.

"You came," she said, voice breaking.

"Always." He cupped her face gently, mindful of the bruise. "I'll always come for you."

She kissed him then, desperate and fierce, tasting of copper and fear and relief. When they broke apart, Viktor was watching them from across the van, his eyes cold despite the blood soaking his expensive shirt.

"This isn't over," Viktor said quietly. "You've just started a war you can't win."

Max met his gaze without flinching. "We'll see."

As the van raced through the darkened streets, Max pulled Roxana close, feeling her heartbeat against his chest, rapid and alive. They'd gotten her out. The operation was blown, their cover compromised, and the fallout would be catastrophic.

But she was alive.

For now, that was enough.

## Chapter 10: Extraction

**Scene 1: Max's extraction team breaches...**

The front door exploded inward at 3:47 AM.

Max moved through the smoke, MP5 raised, the red dot sight cutting through the haze. Behind him, four operators from the extraction team fanned out in practiced precision—shadows in tactical black, their movements synchronized like a choreographed dance of controlled violence.

"Contact left!" someone shouted.

Muzzle flashes erupted from the mansion's grand staircase. Viktor's security detail—three men in suits, their weapons already drawn—opened fire from elevated positions. Bullets chewed into the marble floor, sending chips of stone ricocheting through the foyer. A crystal chandelier shattered, raining glass like deadly snow.

Max dropped to one knee behind a massive oak credenza, returning fire in controlled bursts. The familiar kick of the weapon, the acrid smell of cordite, the ringing in his ears—it all fell away, replaced by the crystalline clarity that came with combat. Time slowed. His world narrowed to targets and angles, threats and solutions.

"Tango down!" Miller's voice crackled through the comms.

One of Viktor's men crumpled on the stairs, his weapon clattering down the steps. The remaining guards retreated, laying down suppressing fire as they backed toward the east wing.

"Clear left!"

"Moving right!"

Max's team advanced through the foyer like a tide, methodical and unstoppable. He'd memorized the mansion's layout during the planning phase—every room, every corridor, every exit. Roxana's bedroom was on the second floor, west wing. That's where she'd be.

That's where Viktor would go.

A guard appeared in the doorway to the dining room, weapon raised. Max fired twice—center mass, clean kills, no hesitation. The man dropped. Max stepped over the body without looking down, his focus already on the next threat, the next room, the next second.

"Second floor, move!" he commanded.

They hit the stairs in a tactical column. Behind them, the crash of breaking glass signaled the second team breaching through the terrace doors. The mansion had become a war zone, the elegant spaces transformed into a battlefield of overturned furniture and bullet-scarred walls.

Max reached the second-floor landing just as a door burst open down the hall.

Viktor emerged, his silk pajamas incongruous against the violence surrounding him. His face was pale, eyes wild with the desperation of a cornered animal. In his right hand, a Makarov pistol gleamed under the emergency lighting that had kicked on when the power was cut.

His left hand gripped Roxana's arm.

She wore a white nightgown, her dark hair disheveled, her eyes wide with terror. Viktor yanked her in front of him as a human shield, the pistol now pressed against her temple.

"Stop!" Viktor's voice cracked, the urbane businessman replaced by something feral and afraid. "Stop or I kill her!"

Max's weapon remained trained on them, his finger resting alongside the trigger guard. Not yet. Not with Roxana in the line of fire. The red dot danced across Viktor's exposed shoulder, but the angle was wrong, the risk too high.

"Let her go, Viktor." Max's voice was steady, calm, a stark contrast to the chaos around them. "It's over."

"Over?" Viktor laughed, a sound like breaking glass. "You think you can just walk into my home? You think there are no consequences?"

He began backing down the corridor, dragging Roxana with him. She stumbled, her bare feet sliding on the polished hardwood. Max saw the terror in her eyes, but also something else—a flash of recognition when she saw him, a spark of hope that made his chest tighten.

"Team, hold position," Max ordered into his comm. To Viktor: "Where are you going to go? The house is surrounded."

"Then we all die together." Viktor's hand shook, the pistol trembling against Roxana's skin. A thin line of blood appeared where the sight had cut her. "Back away. All of you. Back away or I swear to God—"

Roxana's eyes locked with Max's. In that moment, he saw everything—the fear, yes, but also trust. She trusted him. Despite everything, despite the lies and the manipulation and the impossible situation he'd put her in, she trusted him to save her.

The weight of that trust was crushing.

Viktor continued backing away, disappearing around the corner toward the mansion's rear wing. Toward the garage, Max realized. He had an escape route planned, probably had it planned for years.

"Sir?" Miller's voice in his ear, waiting for orders.

Max was already moving, his team flowing behind him like water. The firefight continued below—sporadic bursts of gunfire as the remaining guards were neutralized—but his focus had narrowed to a single objective.

Get to Roxana. Stop Viktor. End this.

The corridor stretched ahead, lit by emergency strips along the baseboards. Doors flashed past—bedroom, bathroom, study. Viktor's footsteps echoed from somewhere ahead, running now, desperate.

Max ran faster.

The game had changed. This was no longer about the mission, about the documents or the intelligence or the carefully constructed operation. This was about the woman he'd sworn to protect, the woman whose life now hung by the thread of a madman's fraying sanity.

Behind him, the mansion burned with the aftermath of violence. Ahead, in the darkness of the corridor, Viktor Volkov fled toward his final stand.

And Max Monroe, former Marine, CIA operative, and the man who'd fallen for his target against every rule in the book, pursued.

**Scene 2: Max pursues Viktor through the...**

**Scene 2: Max pursues Viktor through the mansion to the garage**

Max's boots pounded against marble, then hardwood, then concrete as he chased Viktor's retreating form through the labyrinthine mansion. The acrid smell of gunpowder hung in the air behind him, mixing with the metallic taste of adrenaline on his tongue.

"Viktor, stop!" Max's voice echoed through the corridor. "There's nowhere to go!"

A door slammed ahead—the sound reverberating like a gunshot. Max rounded the corner in time to see Viktor dragging Roxana through the service entrance toward the garage. Her terrified eyes locked with his for a split second before Viktor yanked her forward, one arm wrapped around her throat.

Max burst through the door into the cavernous garage. The space smelled of expensive leather, motor oil, and fear. Overhead fluorescents cast harsh shadows across a collection of luxury vehicles—a Bentley, two Mercedes, a vintage Porsche. Viktor had backed himself against the far wall, near a black Range Rover, Roxana clutched against his chest like a shield.

"Stay back!" Viktor's voice cracked with desperation. His Glock 19 pressed against Roxana's temple, his hand trembling. Sweat streamed down his face, darkening the collar of his silk shirt. "I swear to God, Monroe, I'll do it!"

Max raised his hands slowly, his own weapon lowered but ready. His heart hammered against his ribs, but his breathing remained controlled—years of training overriding the primal panic threatening to consume him. Roxana's face was pale, her eyes wide with terror, a thin trickle of blood running from where Viktor had struck her during their escape.

"Viktor, listen to me." Max's voice was calm, measured. He took a careful step forward, his eyes never leaving Viktor's trigger finger. "You pull that trigger, you have nothing. No leverage, no bargaining chip. You're a smart man. You know how this ends."

"How it ends?" Viktor laughed, a brittle, manic sound. "How it ends is I walk out of here with my daughter, or she dies. Your choice, American."

Roxana whimpered, and Max saw her knees buckle slightly. Viktor jerked her upright, the gun digging deeper into her skin.

"She's not a bargaining chip," Max said, taking another measured step. The distance between them was maybe fifteen feet now. Too far for a clean disarm, but close enough to read Viktor's micro-expressions. "She's your daughter."

"My daughter betrayed me!" Spittle flew from Viktor's lips. His eyes were wild, pupils dilated. "She chose you over her own blood. Over everything I built for her!"

"You built a prison," Max said quietly. "You built it with blood money and lies."

Viktor's face contorted with rage. "You know nothing about what I've built! Nothing about what I've sacrificed!"

Max watched Viktor's gun hand. The trembling had increased. The man was spiraling, fear and fury making him unpredictable. Max needed to either de-escalate or create an opening. He couldn't do both.

"Roxana." Max shifted his gaze to her, making his voice gentle. "Look at me."

Her eyes found his, tears streaming down her cheeks.

"It's going to be okay," Max said. "Trust me."

"Don't talk to her!" Viktor screamed, pressing the gun harder. Roxana cried out in pain.

Something cold and deadly crystallized in Max's chest. He'd been trying to save Viktor's life along with Roxana's, hoping for a clean resolution. But watching Roxana's pain, seeing the madness in Viktor's eyes, Max made his choice.

"Last chance, Viktor." Max's voice dropped to a lethal calm. "Let her go."

"Or what? You'll shoot?" Viktor sneered. "With her in the way? I trained with Spetsnaz, Monroe. You don't have the shot."

Max's eyes narrowed. He'd been calculating angles, measuring distances, watching Viktor's positioning. The man had made a critical error—in his panic, he'd exposed his right shoulder, the gun hand extended just far enough past Roxana's head.

"You're right," Max said softly. "I don't have the shot."

Viktor's lips curled into a triumphant smile.

"But I don't need the whole shot."

Max moved. His arm came up in one fluid motion, muscle memory and countless hours on the range collapsing into a single moment of absolute clarity. The world narrowed to the triangle of Viktor's exposed shoulder, the angle of deflection, the margin of error measured in millimeters.

The Sig Sauer barked once.

Viktor's scream filled the garage as the bullet tore through his shoulder. The impact spun him backward, his arm flying wide. Roxana dropped, her survival instinct kicking in as she'd been trained during their brief preparation sessions. She hit the concrete and rolled left.

Max was already moving, closing the distance in three long strides. Viktor's gun clattered across the floor. Max kicked it away, then drove his knee into Viktor's chest, pinning him against the Range Rover. The older man gasped, clutching his shattered shoulder, blood seeping between his fingers.

"Roxana!" Max called out, not taking his eyes off Viktor.

"I'm okay." Her voice was shaking but strong. "I'm okay."

Footsteps thundered behind them. Max's extraction team poured into the garage, weapons drawn, tactical lights cutting through the shadows.

"Secure him," Max ordered, stepping back. Two team members moved in, zip-tying Viktor's wrists while a third applied pressure to the shoulder wound. Viktor groaned, his face gray with pain and shock.

Max turned to Roxana. She was standing now, backed against a Mercedes, her whole body trembling. He holstered his weapon and moved toward her slowly, hands visible, giving her space to process.

"It's over," he said softly. "You're safe now."

She looked at him, then at her father being hauled to his feet by the extraction team. Something broke in her expression—relief, grief, horror all colliding at once. She stumbled forward, and Max caught her, wrapping his arms around her as she collapsed against his chest.

"I've got you," he whispered into her hair. "I've got you."

Her fingers clutched his tactical vest, and he felt her tears soaking through his shirt. Behind them, the team leader approached.

"Premises secure, sir. Documents retrieved. Vehicle's ready for extraction."

Max nodded, not releasing Roxana. "Get Viktor to medical, then to holding. I want him under 24-hour watch."

"Yes, sir."

As they led Viktor away, the wounded man's voice echoed back through the garage. "Roxana! Roxana, you don't understand what you've done!"

She flinched in Max's arms but didn't turn around.

"Don't listen to him," Max said. "Let's get you out of here."

He guided her toward the waiting SUV, one arm around her shoulders, shielding her from the chaos of the operation wrapping up around them. The night air hit them as they emerged from the garage—cold, clean, carrying the distant wail of approaching sirens.

The extraction vehicle's door stood open. Max helped Roxana inside, then slid in beside her as the driver accelerated away from the mansion. Through the rear window, Max watched Viktor's estate recede into the darkness, emergency lights beginning to paint the Vienna night in shades of red and blue.

Roxana sat rigid beside him, staring at nothing, her breathing shallow and rapid. Shock was setting in. Max reached for the emergency blanket stored in the door panel and wrapped it around her shoulders.

"Roxana," he said gently. "Look at me."

She turned, her eyes unfocused, pupils still dilated from fear.

"You're safe," Max repeated. "I promise you, you're safe."

She nodded mechanically, but he could see she wasn't really hearing him. The adrenaline was wearing off, leaving only the trauma of what she'd just survived—her father, the man who'd raised her, holding a gun to her head.

Max pulled her against him, and this time she didn't resist. She curled into his side, the trembling intensifying. He held her close, one hand stroking her hair, whispering reassurances he wasn't sure she could hear.

The city lights of Vienna blurred past the windows as they raced toward the safe house. Max's secure phone buzzed in his pocket—undoubtedly Sabine Voss, demanding answers about the unauthorized extraction that had just turned into an international incident.

He ignored it.

Right now, the only thing that mattered was the broken woman in his arms and the promise he'd made to keep her safe. Everything else

**Scene 3: Max takes the calculated shot,...**

The garage smelled of motor oil and gunpowder. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting harsh shadows across the polished concrete floor. Viktor's Bentley sat gleaming beside a vintage Mercedes, both vehicles now blocked by the extraction team's tactical van.

Max's finger rested against the trigger, his breathing steady despite the adrenaline surging through his veins. Twenty feet separated them—Viktor's back pressed against the garage's rear wall, Roxana held tight against his chest, the muzzle of his Makarov pressing into the soft flesh beneath her jaw.

"I said back off!" Viktor's voice cracked, sweat beading on his forehead. Blood seeped through his dress shirt from the graze wound on his left arm—a parting gift from the firefight upstairs.

Roxana's eyes found Max's. Wide. Terrified. But beneath the fear, he saw something else. Trust.

"You won't make it out of Vienna," Max said, his Glock held in a two-handed grip, perfectly still. "Let her go, and we can negotiate terms."

Viktor laughed, a bitter sound that echoed off the garage walls. "Negotiate? You Americans and your negotiations." He jerked Roxana closer, making her gasp. "She's my wife. My property. You have no—"

Max didn't let him finish.

The calculation was instantaneous—angle of fire, Viktor's exposed shoulder above Roxana's left ear, the slight lean in his posture. Max had made harder shots on the range a hundred times. But never with everything that mattered in the line of fire.

The Glock bucked once.

The sound was deafening in the enclosed space. Viktor's shoulder exploded in a spray of red, the impact spinning him backward. His gun clattered across the concrete. Roxana stumbled forward, a scream caught in her throat.

Max was already moving, his weapon trained on Viktor as the man crumpled against the Mercedes, clutching his shattered shoulder. "Secure him!" Max barked to the extraction team pouring through the garage entrance.

But his focus was on Roxana.

She stood frozen in the middle of the garage, arms wrapped around herself, whole body shaking. Her cream silk blouse—the one she'd worn to play the perfect hostess at Viktor's dinner party—was splattered with her husband's blood.

"Roxana." Max holstered his weapon and closed the distance between them in three strides. "Look at me. Are you hurt?"

She didn't respond. Her eyes were fixed on Viktor, who was now surrounded by three tactical team members, one applying pressure to his wound while another secured his wrists with flex cuffs.

"Roxana." Max gently cupped her face, forcing her gaze to meet his. Her skin was ice-cold despite the warm summer night. "I need you to tell me if you're hurt."

Her lips moved, but no sound came out at first. Then, barely a whisper: "He was going to kill me."

"He's not going to hurt you ever again." Max ran his hands down her arms, checking for injuries, his touch clinical but his heart hammering. No blood. No wounds. "Can you walk?"

Behind them, Viktor groaned as the medic worked on his shoulder. "You're dead, Monroe," he spat, his accent thicker now, roughened by pain. "Both of you. My people will find—"

"Shut him up," Max snapped without turning around.

One of the team members produced a strip of duct tape.

Roxana flinched at Viktor's muffled protests. Max stepped into her line of sight, blocking her view of her husband. "Look at me. Just me. We're getting you out of here, but I need you to stay with me. Can you do that?"

She nodded, but her trembling intensified.

"Monroe, we're clear upstairs," a voice crackled through his earpiece. "Documents secured. Three hostiles down, two wounded. No friendly casualties."

"Copy that. Prep the primary vehicle for immediate departure. We're bringing the package out now."

Max shrugged off his tactical vest and draped it over Roxana's shoulders, covering the bloodstained blouse. She grabbed the edges of the vest, pulling it tight around herself like armor.

"The garage opens onto the service alley," she said suddenly, her voice stronger. "There's a camera at the corner of Prinz-Eugen-Straße. It covers the intersection."

Max nodded, impressed despite the circumstances. Even in shock, her mind was working, providing tactical information. "We know. It's been looped for the last twenty minutes."

A black SUV pulled into the garage entrance, its engine purring. The rear door swung open.

"Time to go," Max said softly. He kept one hand on Roxana's elbow, guiding her toward the vehicle. She moved mechanically, one foot in front of the other.

As they passed Viktor, he lunged against his restraints, trying to speak through the tape. Roxana stopped, her whole body rigid.

"Don't," Max said. "He doesn't deserve your attention."

But Roxana turned anyway, looking down at the man she'd been married to for five years. The man who'd controlled every aspect of her life. The man who'd held a gun to her head minutes ago.

"Goodbye, Viktor," she said quietly.

Then she let Max help her into the SUV.

The team leader appeared at Max's side as he prepared to climb in after Roxana. "What about cleanup?"

"Standard protocol. Sanitize the office, secure all documents and drives. Local police response in"—Max checked his watch—"approximately four minutes. Be ghosts."

"And him?" The team leader jerked his chin toward Viktor.

Max's jaw tightened. Every instinct screamed to leave Viktor bleeding on the garage floor. But they needed him alive, needed the intelligence he could provide. "Stabilize him and transfer to the secondary location. Sabine's interrogation team will handle it from there."

If Sabine doesn't kill me first, Max thought.

He slid into the SUV beside Roxana. She'd curled into the far corner of the seat, the tactical vest still wrapped around her, her eyes unfocused.

"Go," Max ordered the driver.

The vehicle surged forward, tires squealing as they accelerated out of the garage and into Vienna's night. Through the rear window, Max watched the mansion recede—lights blazing, his team moving with practiced efficiency through the chaos they'd created.

Roxana hadn't moved. Hadn't blinked.

Max reached for her hand. It was still ice-cold, but her fingers immediately tightened around his, gripping with desperate strength.

"You're safe now," he murmured.

She turned to look at him, and the expression in her eyes made his chest constrict. Not relief. Not gratitude. Terror.

"No," she whispered. "I'm not. None of us are."

The SUV merged into traffic, just another vehicle in Vienna's elegant streets. Behind them, sirens began to wail.

**Scene 4: Max rushes Roxana to the waitin...**

**Scene 4: Max rushes Roxana to the waiting armored vehicle**

The night air hit them like a slap as Max burst through the mansion's side entrance, his arm locked around Roxana's waist. She stumbled, her legs barely functioning, and he practically carried her across the gravel drive where the black Mercedes SUV idled with its rear door open.

"Go, go!" Max barked at the driver as he shoved Roxana into the back seat and threw himself in behind her. The door hadn't fully closed before the vehicle lurched forward, tires spitting gravel as they accelerated down the long driveway.

Behind them, muzzle flashes still lit the mansion's windows. Radio chatter crackled in Max's earpiece—his team calling out room clearances, confirming the target was secured, requesting medical for one of Viktor's guards. He ripped the earpiece out and tossed it onto the floor.

Roxana sat rigid beside him, pressed against the far door like she might disappear into it. Her evening gown was torn at the shoulder, revealing a livid bruise already forming where Viktor had grabbed her. Her carefully styled hair had come loose, dark strands plastered to her cheeks with sweat. But it was her eyes that made Max's chest constrict—wide and glassy, staring at nothing, seeing everything.

"Roxana." His voice came out rougher than he intended.

No response. Not even a flicker of recognition.

The SUV hit the main road, and the driver—a compact Austrian named Klaus who Max had worked with twice before—punched the accelerator. Vienna's elegant streetlights blurred into ribbons of gold as they wove through the late-night traffic of the diplomatic quarter.

Max reached for Roxana slowly, telegraphing the movement like he would with a spooked animal. When his fingers brushed her arm, she flinched violently, a sharp intake of breath the only sound she'd made since they'd left the mansion.

"It's over," he said, keeping his hand where it was, a gentle pressure on her forearm. "You're safe now. I've got you."

Her breathing was too fast, too shallow. He'd seen this before—the body's delayed reaction to mortal terror, the mind shutting down to process what it couldn't handle in real time. She'd held it together remarkably well in that garage, standing perfectly still with Viktor's gun pressed to her temple, her eyes locked on Max's with absolute trust. Now the adrenaline was draining away, leaving only the trauma.

"Roxana, look at me." He shifted closer, blocking her view of the window, of the city rushing past. "You're safe. He can't hurt you anymore."

Her lips parted, but no words came. A tremor started in her hands and spread through her entire body. Max pulled off his tactical jacket and wrapped it around her shoulders, the fabric still warm from his body heat.

"Route?" Klaus called from the front, his eyes flicking to the rearview mirror.

"Safe house. The one in Leopoldstadt." Max's hand moved to Roxana's back, feeling the violent shaking through the jacket. "Fast, but clean. No attention."

"*Verstanden.*"

They turned onto the Ringstrasse, merging with a handful of taxis and late-night delivery trucks. A tram glided past in the opposite direction, its windows full of ordinary people heading home from ordinary evenings. The normalcy of it felt obscene.

Roxana's breathing hitched, and Max realized she was trying to speak. He leaned closer.

"The... the documents," she whispered, her voice fractured. "Did you—"

"We got them. Everything." He found her hand in the folds of his jacket and held it, shocked by how cold her fingers were. "You did it, Roxana. You got us everything we needed."

A single tear tracked down her cheek, catching the passing streetlights. Then another. Her face remained blank, expressionless, but the tears kept coming in silent streams.

Max pulled her against his chest, one hand cradling the back of her head. She didn't resist, didn't react at all, just let herself be held like a broken doll. He could feel her heart hammering against his ribs, too fast, too hard.

"Breathe with me," he murmured into her hair. "In for four. Hold for four. Out for four."

She didn't follow the pattern. Her breathing stayed ragged and quick.

The radio on Klaus's belt crackled with German police codes—nothing about them, just the usual urban symphony of minor accidents and noise complaints. They crossed the Danube Canal, leaving the grand architecture of the inner city behind for the darker, quieter streets of the residential district.

Max's phone vibrated insistently in his pocket. He didn't need to check it to know it was Sabine, demanding answers, already calculating the political fallout. The unauthorized extraction of a foreign national from a diplomatic residence. The firefight. The wounded security personnel. This wasn't just burning bridges—it was napalming the entire intelligence community.

He didn't care.

Roxana's trembling had intensified, her whole body shaking so violently he worried she might be going into shock. Her skin was clammy, her lips losing color.

"Klaus, how long?"

"Three minutes."

Too long. Max tilted Roxana's face up, forcing her unfocused eyes to meet his. "Stay with me. Three minutes and we're there. You can fall apart then, but right now I need you to stay with me."

Something flickered in her gaze—a spark of the woman who'd walked into a lion's den armed with nothing but courage and a wire. Her fingers curled weakly around his wrist.

"I killed him," she breathed, the words barely audible. "I killed my father."

"No." Max's grip on her tightened. "I killed him. You survived him. There's a difference."

"He's not dead," Klaus interjected quietly. "Radio says the target is stable. Shoulder wound, heavy bleeding, but stable."

Roxana's eyes slipped closed. Max couldn't tell if the news brought her relief or disappointment.

The SUV slowed, turning into a narrow street lined with anonymous apartment buildings. Klaus killed the headlights as they approached a underground garage, the door already rolling open in response to the encrypted signal. They descended into fluorescent-lit concrete, the sudden silence after the engine cut almost painful.

Max looked down at the woman in his arms—this woman who'd trusted him with everything, who'd walked into hell because he'd asked her to. Her tears had stopped, but the trembling hadn't. She stared at nothing with those glassy, haunted eyes.

He'd promised her safety. He'd promised her justice. He'd promised her a way out.

Now he had to figure out how to deliver on any of it while his entire world burned down around them.

"We're here," he said softly. "Let's get you inside."

Roxana didn't move, didn't acknowledge his words. She just kept staring into the middle distance, lost somewhere Max couldn't follow.

Not yet, anyway.

He slid out of the vehicle and reached back for her, and this time when he touched her, she didn't flinch. She let him guide her out, let him support her weight as they moved toward the elevator where two of his team members waited, their faces carefully neutral.

Behind them, Klaus was already wiping down the SUV's interior, erasing evidence of their passage. Covering tracks. Buying time.

Time Max was going to need, because when Sabine Voss caught up with him—and she would—there would be hell to pay.

The elevator doors closed, sealing them in brushed steel and harsh light. Roxana swayed against him, and Max wrapped both arms around her, holding her upright.

Four floors up, the doors opened onto a safe house that would be their sanctuary or their prison, depending on how the next few hours played out.

Max guided Roxana inside, and the door locked behind them with a sound like a cell closing.

**Scene 5: During the tense drive to the ...**

**Scene 5: During the tense drive to the safe house**

The armored Mercedes tore through Vienna's rain-slicked streets, its reinforced chassis absorbing every pothole like a punch to the gut. Max held Roxana against his chest in the backseat, feeling each tremor that rippled through her body. She hadn't spoken since the garage—hadn't made a sound except for the shallow, rapid breathing that told him she was seconds from hyperventilating.

"Easy," he murmured into her hair, keeping his voice low and steady. "Just breathe with me. In for four, hold for four, out for four. You're safe now."

Her fingers clutched his tactical vest so tightly he could feel her knuckles digging into his ribs through the Kevlar. Blood—Viktor's blood—stained her white blouse, a crimson constellation spreading across silk. Max resisted the urge to look at his watch. Every second they spent on Vienna's streets was another second Viktor's network could mobilize.

Through the rain-streaked window, the city blurred past in smears of golden light and shadow. The Ringstrasse's elegant facades gave way to narrower streets, then to the industrial district where the safe house waited. Dmitri drove with controlled aggression, taking corners hard enough to make the tires scream but smooth enough not to flip them.

"How long?" Max asked.

"Four minutes," Dmitri replied, his eyes never leaving the road. "No tail that I can see, but—"

"But that doesn't mean anything." Max finished the thought. Viktor Volkov's people were professionals. If they were being followed, they wouldn't know it until bullets started flying.

Roxana's breathing hitched, and Max tightened his arms around her instinctively. "You did everything right back there," he said softly. "When you dropped—that was perfect. Textbook."

She finally moved, pulling back just enough to look up at him. Her makeup was ruined, mascara tracking down her cheeks in dark rivers, but her eyes were clear. Clearer than they'd been in the mansion, anyway.

"You could have missed," she whispered. Her voice was hoarse, raw. "The shot. You could have—"

"I didn't." He brushed a strand of damp hair from her face, his thumb coming away sticky with someone else's blood. "I wouldn't have taken it if there was any doubt."

That was a lie, and they both knew it. The angle had been tight—too tight by any reasonable standard. Viktor's gun pressed against Roxana's temple, his finger on the trigger, his body mostly shielded behind hers. Max had taken the shot anyway, trusting muscle memory and a decade of training to guide the bullet into Viktor's shoulder instead of through Roxana's skull.

Three inches. That's how much margin for error he'd had. Three inches between a clean wound and a catastrophic kill shot.

His phone buzzed in his pocket—the encrypted one. Max didn't need to check it to know who was calling. Sabine Voss had probably been trying to reach him for the past twenty minutes. Each unanswered call would be another nail in his career's coffin.

"Max." Roxana's hand found his, her fingers ice-cold. "What happens now?"

The question hung in the humid air of the vehicle's interior, mixing with the smell of gun oil and adrenaline sweat. What happens now? Max had been asking himself the same thing since the moment he'd pulled the trigger.

Protocol dictated he should have left Roxana behind. The mission objective was the documents—proof of Viktor's money laundering operation, evidence that would unravel a network spanning three continents. They had those documents. The flash drive was secure in Dmitri's vest pocket, along with the physical files they'd grabbed from Viktor's safe.

The smart play would have been to extract with the evidence and leave Roxana to face whatever consequences came from her husband's arrest. She was a civilian. Not an asset. Not part of the mission parameters.

But Max had looked into Viktor's eyes in that garage and seen something that made his blood run cold. Not fear. Not desperation. Calculation. Viktor had been weighing whether killing Roxana would buy him enough time to escape.

And Max had realized that leaving her behind was a death sentence.

"We get you somewhere safe," he said, surprised by how steady his voice sounded. "Somewhere Viktor's people can't reach you. Then we figure out the rest."

"Your people won't protect me." Roxana's laugh was bitter, brittle. "I'm a liability. Evidence, at best. At worst, I'm a loose end."

She wasn't wrong. Max had worked enough extractions to know how this played out. The Agency would debrief Roxana, squeeze her for every piece of intelligence she could provide about Viktor's operation, then cut her loose with a new identity and a one-way ticket to somewhere forgettable. If she was lucky.

If she wasn't lucky—if Sabine decided Roxana knew too much, or if the political calculus shifted—she'd disappear into protective custody that was really just a prettier word for prison.

"Two minutes," Dmitri announced.

The safe house was a converted warehouse in Simmering, chosen for its multiple exits and clear sight lines. Max had used it twice before, both times for short-term staging before moving assets out of the country. It wasn't designed for extended stays, but it would do for tonight.

Tomorrow, he'd have to face Sabine. Tomorrow, he'd have to explain why he'd deviated from the mission parameters, why he'd risked his team to extract an unauthorized target, why he'd potentially compromised years of intelligence work for one woman.

Tomorrow, he'd have to justify the unjustifiable.

But tonight, Roxana was alive. That had to be enough.

His phone buzzed again. This time, a text message cut through his thoughts like a knife:

*Call me. Now. -SC*

Sabine's messages were usually longer, more detailed. The brevity told him everything he needed to know about how much trouble he was in.

Roxana must have felt him tense because she looked up again, her eyes searching his face. "Max, whatever you've done—whatever this costs you—"

"Don't." He cut her off gently but firmly. "Don't apologize. Don't thank me. Just... don't."

Because if she thanked him, if she acknowledged the sacrifice he was making, it would make it real. It would force him to confront the magnitude of what he'd just thrown away. His career. His reputation. Possibly his freedom, if Sabine decided to push charges for insubordination.

The Mercedes slowed, turning into a narrow alley between two industrial buildings. The safe house's garage door was already rising, activated by the encrypted signal from Dmitri's phone. Inside, the rest of the extraction team would be waiting—Jake and Marcus, who'd provided overwatch during the mansion assault, and probably a very angry communications officer who'd been trying to maintain operational security while Max went completely off-script.

"We're here," Dmitri said, pulling into the garage. The door began closing behind them immediately, sealing them into fluorescent-lit concrete.

Roxana's grip on Max's vest tightened one more time. "I'm sorry," she whispered, too quietly for anyone else to hear.

Max didn't respond. He couldn't. Because she was apologizing for being alive, for being worth saving, and that was something he refused to accept.

The vehicle stopped. Through the windshield, Max could see Jake and Marcus approaching, their faces carefully neutral. Professional. But their eyes told a different story—they knew the shitstorm that was coming.

"Ready?" Max asked Roxana.

She nodded, though they both knew she wasn't. How could anyone be ready for what came next? Her life as she knew it was over. Her marriage, her home, her identity—all of it would have to be burned and rebuilt from ash.

Max opened the door and stepped out first, his body instinctively positioning itself between Roxana and any potential threats. Old habits. Good habits.

Roxana followed, her legs unsteady as she emerged into the harsh light. She looked small suddenly, diminished by shock and trauma, nothing like the poised woman he'd watched navigate Viktor's world with practiced grace.

Jake approached, his expression grim. "Sabine's been calling every thirty seconds. She's—"

"I know." Max cut him off. "Get Roxana inside. Food, water, clean clothes. I'll deal with Sabine."

But as Roxana disappeared into the safe house flanked by Marcus, and as Max pulled out his phone to face the consequences of his choices, one thought crystallized in his mind with absolute clarity:

He'd do it all again. Every unauthorized decision. Every broken protocol. Every burned bridge.

Some things were worth more than a career.

The phone rang once before Sabine answered. Her voice was ice.

"Start talking, Max. And this better be good."

**Scene 6: They arrive at the safe house,...**

The safe house sat on the fourth floor of a weathered building in Floridsdorf, far from the gilded palaces and tourist-choked streets of Vienna's center. Max guided Roxana up the narrow stairwell, one hand steadying her elbow, the other resting on the Glock beneath his jacket. The building smelled of boiled cabbage and old cigarette smoke—anonymous, forgettable. Perfect.

He unlocked three separate deadbolts before pushing the door open, sweeping the interior with practiced efficiency. Empty. The team had done their job.

"Come on," he said softly, drawing Roxana inside.

She moved like a sleepwalker, her designer dress torn at the shoulder, mascara smudged beneath her eyes. The trembling hadn't stopped since the garage. Max locked the door behind them, engaging each bolt with deliberate clicks that echoed in the sparse apartment.

The space was utilitarian—a worn couch facing a blank wall, a kitchenette with chipped laminate counters, blackout curtains already drawn tight against the windows. A single lamp cast weak yellow light across the room, creating more shadows than illumination.

Max guided Roxana to the couch. She sank onto it without resistance, staring at her hands. They were still shaking.

"I'll get you some water," he said.

He moved to the kitchen, filling a glass from the tap while keeping her in his peripheral vision. His phone buzzed in his pocket—Sabine, undoubtedly. He ignored it. The extraction team would have already reported in. Viktor was in custody, the documents secured. The mission, technically, was a success.

Technically.

Max returned to the couch, pressing the glass into Roxana's hands. She took it but didn't drink, just held it like an anchor to something real.

"You're safe now," he said, crouching before her so their eyes were level.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "Safe." The word sounded foreign in her mouth. "My uncle will—"

"Your uncle is in custody. He can't touch you."

"You don't understand." Her voice cracked. "He has people everywhere. Vienna, Moscow, Berlin. They'll come for me. They'll—" She broke off, the glass trembling in her grip.

Max gently took it from her before she could spill it, setting it on the floor. Then he took her hands in his, feeling the cold of her fingers, the rapid flutter of her pulse at her wrists.

"Listen to me." His voice was low, steady. "I won't let that happen."

She finally met his eyes. Hers were red-rimmed, haunted, but beneath the fear he saw something else—a desperate need to believe him.

"You can't promise that," she whispered.

"I just did."

Outside, a siren wailed in the distance. Roxana flinched, and Max felt her try to pull away, but he held firm.

"Roxana." He waited until she looked at him again. "I know you've spent your whole life learning not to trust anyone. I know you think everyone has an angle, everyone wants something. But I need you to hear this." He paused, making sure she was listening. "Whatever comes next—whatever Sabine throws at me, whatever your uncle's network tries—I will keep you safe. Even if it costs me my career. Even if it costs me everything."

A tear slipped down her cheek. "Why?"

The question hung between them. Max thought of the dossier he'd read weeks ago, the black-and-white photograph of a woman he'd been assigned to manipulate. He thought of the moment in the gallery when she'd looked at that Klimt painting and he'd seen past the mask she wore. He thought of her hands shaking as she'd handed over Viktor's files, knowing what it would cost her.

"Because you deserve better than the hand you were dealt," he said finally. "And because I'm done pretending this is just a mission."

Her breath hitched. For a long moment, they stayed like that—her hands in his, the weight of what he'd just admitted settling between them like snow.

His phone buzzed again. Then again.

"You should answer that," Roxana said quietly.

"It can wait."

"Max—"

"It can wait." He released one of her hands to brush the tear from her cheek. "Right now, all that matters is that you're here. You're safe. The rest we'll figure out."

She closed her eyes, leaning into his touch. When she opened them again, some of the terror had receded, replaced by something fragile but real—hope.

"I'm going to hold you to that promise," she said.

"Good."

Max stood, helping her settle back against the couch. He grabbed a blanket from the bedroom and draped it over her shoulders. She pulled it tight, her fingers gripping the fabric.

"Try to rest," he said. "I'll be right here."

He moved to the window, carefully parting the blackout curtain just enough to scan the street below. Empty. For now.

His phone buzzed a fourth time. He pulled it out, seeing Sabine's name flash across the screen along with three missed calls and a text: *Call me. NOW.*

Max silenced the phone and slipped it back into his pocket.

Behind him, he heard Roxana's breathing begin to slow, exhaustion finally overtaking adrenaline. He glanced back at her—this woman who'd trusted him with her life, who'd risked everything to do the right thing.

The mission was over. The real fight was just beginning.

Sabine would demand explanations. The Agency would want to debrief Roxana, use her as an asset against Viktor's network. There would be protocols, procedures, chains of command to navigate. And somewhere out there, Viktor's people would already be mobilizing, hunting for the woman who'd betrayed them.

Max looked out at the Vienna night, at the ordinary street with its ordinary buildings hiding extraordinary secrets. He'd spent fifteen years following orders, trusting the system, believing the mission came first.

Not anymore.

Whatever came through that door—whether it was Sabine's fury, the Agency's bureaucracy, or Viktor's revenge—he would face it. And he would win.

Because he'd made Roxana a promise.

And Max Monroe never broke his word.

He let the curtain fall closed and turned back to the room, settling into the chair opposite the couch, his hand resting on his weapon. Outside, Vienna slept. Inside, Max kept watch.

The extraction was complete. But the real cost of Operation Nightingale was only beginning to reveal itself.

And Max had never been more certain of anything in his life: whatever that cost turned out to be, he'd pay it willingly.

## Chapter 11: Safe House

**Scene 1: Max and Roxana arrive at the CI...**

**Scene 1: Max and Roxana arrive at the CIA safe house**

The gravel crunched beneath the tires as the black Mercedes wound through the pre-dawn darkness, headlights cutting pale swaths through the mist that clung to the Austrian countryside. Max pressed his forehead against the cool window glass, watching skeletal trees blur past, their branches reaching like gnarled fingers toward a sky just beginning to lighten from black to charcoal.

Beside him, Roxana sat rigid, her hands folded in her lap. She hadn't spoken since they'd crossed the border an hour ago. The silence between them felt different now—weighted, fragile. Not the comfortable quiet of shared purpose, but something that might shatter if either of them spoke.

Max wanted to reach for her hand. He didn't.

The car slowed, turning onto an unmarked dirt road barely visible between the trees. Through the windshield, a stone farmhouse materialized from the gloom, its windows dark except for a single light burning above the entrance. Ivy climbed the weathered walls. A barn sagged nearby. To anyone passing by—if anyone ever passed by this far from civilization—it would look abandoned, forgotten.

That was the point.

The driver, who hadn't said a word during the entire journey, pulled up to the entrance and killed the engine. The sudden silence was absolute. No birdsong yet. No wind. Just the tick of cooling metal and Max's own heartbeat pulsing in his ears.

The front door opened. Two figures emerged, backlit by the interior light—broad-shouldered men in tactical gear, weapons visible but not drawn. Professional. Efficient. The kind of men who wouldn't hesitate if given the order.

"This is it," Max said quietly. His first words in an hour.

Roxana turned to look at him, and in the dim light, her eyes were unreadable. "Max—"

The car door opened. Cold air rushed in, carrying the scent of wet earth and pine.

"Mr. Monroe." One of the security personnel leaned down, his face impassive. "If you'll come with me, please."

Max climbed out, his legs stiff from the drive, the adrenaline that had sustained him through the escape finally beginning to ebb. He heard Roxana's door open on the other side of the vehicle. Heard her boots hit the gravel.

He tried to catch her eye over the roof of the car, but one of the men was already there, a polite but firm hand gesturing her toward the house. She moved like someone walking to an execution—shoulders back, chin up, but with that barely perceptible hesitation in her step.

"This way, Ms. Volkov," the second agent said.

"Wait." Max started around the car.

A hand caught his elbow. Not rough, but immovable. "Sir, you'll need to come with me. Standard protocol. You'll both be debriefed separately."

"I know the protocol," Max said, sharper than he intended. "Just give us a minute."

"I'm afraid that's not possible."

Roxana had stopped walking. She stood in the gravel drive, the mist swirling around her ankles, looking back at him. The distance between them couldn't have been more than twenty feet, but it felt like miles. Her expression was carefully neutral, but he could see the tension in her jaw, the way her fingers had curled into fists at her sides.

"It's fine," she called out, her voice steady. Professional. The voice of someone who'd been through debriefings before, who knew how these things worked. "I'll see you on the other side."

*Will you?* Max thought but didn't say.

Because suddenly he wasn't sure. Suddenly, standing in this anonymous gravel drive with armed men separating them, the full weight of what they'd done—what *he'd* done by bringing her in—crashed down on him. She was a Russian intelligence officer who'd just betrayed her country. He was a CIA operative who'd broken every rule in the book to get her out.

And now she was walking into a building full of people who would have every reason to doubt her, to question her, to wonder if this whole thing had been an elaborate setup.

"Roxana—"

But she'd already turned away, following her escort up the stone steps. The door swallowed her, and she was gone.

"Mr. Monroe." The hand on his elbow tightened slightly. "Please."

Max let himself be guided toward a different entrance, around the side of the building. His handler—he was already thinking of the man that way—produced a keycard, swiped it through a reader that looked far too modern for the rustic exterior. The lock clicked.

Inside, the farmhouse aesthetic disappeared entirely. Reinforced walls. Security cameras. The antiseptic smell of a government facility. His boots squeaked on linoleum as they walked down a narrow corridor, past closed doors with numbered placards.

They stopped at Room 3. The handler opened it, gestured inside.

"Someone will be with you shortly. There's water and coffee. Bathroom's through there." He pointed to a door in the corner. "I'll need your weapon and your phone."

Max handed over his Glock and the encrypted cell without argument. Standard procedure. He stepped into the room—windowless, furnished with a metal table, two chairs, and a couch that had seen better days. The door closed behind him with a decisive click.

He was alone.

Max stood in the center of the room, still wearing his jacket, still feeling the phantom weight of his gun at his hip. Somewhere in this building, Roxana was in a room just like this one. Being processed. Being evaluated. Being—

He forced himself to stop. To breathe. To trust that the intelligence she'd risked everything to bring out would speak for itself.

But as he sank onto the couch, exhaustion finally crashing over him like a wave, one thought kept circling back:

What if it wasn't enough?

**Scene 2: Sabine Voss arrives and confron...**

**Scene 2: Sabine Voss arrives and confronts Max**

The briefing room smelled of stale coffee and antiseptic, its gray walls bare except for a single clock that ticked with mechanical indifference. Max sat at the steel table, his fingers drumming an irregular pattern on the cold surface, when the door slammed open hard enough to rattle the frame.

Sabine Voss strode in like a thunderstorm given human form.

She didn't sit. Didn't even pause. Her heels clicked sharp staccato beats on the linoleum as she crossed to the table and slapped a manila folder down so hard that Max's untouched coffee cup jumped.

"Do you have any idea," she said, her voice low and deadly, "what you've done?"

Max met her gaze. "I extracted an asset who—"

"An *unauthorized* extraction." Sabine's eyes blazed. "You went completely off-protocol. No clearance. No backup plan. No diplomatic cover. The Vienna station chief spent the last four hours explaining to the Austrian intelligence service why one of our contractors staged what looked like a kidnapping in their capital."

"Roxana's life was—"

"I don't care." Sabine finally sat, leaning forward with her hands flat on the table. "You don't make those calls, Max. You report. You wait for authorization. You follow the goddamn chain of command."

The clock ticked. Three seconds. Four.

Max's jaw tightened. "She had maybe six hours before Viktor's people found her. You want me to apologize for not letting her die while I filed paperwork?"

"I want you to understand that you don't get to play cowboy with international incidents!" Sabine's voice rose, controlled fury crackling through every syllable. "We have protocols for a reason. Deniability. Diplomatic channels. You just burned through all of them because you decided your judgment was more important than operational security."

"My judgment kept Roxana alive."

"Your judgment compromised an entire network!" Sabine yanked open the folder, pulling out photographs—surveillance stills of Max and Roxana at the train station, grainy but unmistakable. "Russian intelligence has these. So does the FSB. So does every foreign service that monitors Vienna Central. Your face is now flagged in half a dozen databases as a hostile operative."

Max stared at the photos. His reflection looked back, frozen mid-motion, Roxana's hand in his.

"I'd do it again," he said quietly.

Sabine's laugh was sharp and humorless. "Of course you would. Because Max Monroe doesn't think about consequences. Doesn't consider that maybe—just maybe—there are people whose job it is to weigh risks and make strategic decisions."

"Strategic decisions." Max stood abruptly, his chair scraping back. "Is that what we're calling it when we leave sources to die? When we sacrifice people who trusted us because extraction isn't 'strategically optimal'?"

"Don't you dare." Sabine rose to match him, her small frame radiating coiled intensity. "Don't you dare make this about moral high ground. You know what happens when operations go sideways without authorization? People get killed. Stations get compromised. Wars start over less."

"Roxana had intelligence that—"

"I've read the preliminary debrief." Sabine's voice dropped back to ice. "I know what she brought. And yes, it's significant. Potentially game-changing. But that doesn't excuse the fact that you created a diplomatic nightmare and put yourself—and this agency—in an impossible position."

The ventilation system hummed in the silence that followed. Max could feel his pulse in his temples, adrenaline still coursing from the extraction mixing with frustration that tasted like copper on his tongue.

"So what now?" he asked. "You pull me? Send me home?"

Sabine studied him for a long moment, her expression unreadable. When she spoke, her voice carried a weariness that aged her ten years.

"What I *should* do is put you on the first flight to Langley for a disciplinary review." She gathered the photographs, sliding them back into the folder with precise movements. "What I'm *going to* do is let you sit here and think about whether following orders is really such an unreasonable request."

She moved toward the door, then paused with her hand on the handle.

"The documents Roxana brought—they're being analyzed now. If they're as valuable as she claims, it might save your career." Sabine's eyes found his again, hard and unforgiving. "But don't mistake operational success for approval, Max. You broke protocol. You went rogue. And there will be consequences."

The door closed behind her with a final, definitive click.

Max stood alone in the gray room, the clock's ticking suddenly loud in his ears, and wondered if doing the right thing was supposed to feel this much like falling.

**Scene 3: Sabine reviews the documents El...**

**Scene 3: Sabine reviews the documents Roxana obtained**

The analysis room smelled of burnt coffee and electronic equipment. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting harsh white light across the steel table where Sabine Voss spread the documents like a dealer arranging cards. Her hands moved with precision, sorting photographs from financial records, encrypted communications from personnel files.

Max stood against the far wall, arms crossed, watching her work. The adrenaline from Vienna had finally worn off, leaving him hollow and exhausted. His shoulder throbbed where he'd slammed into the door frame during their escape.

Sabine hadn't spoken to him in twenty minutes. The silence was worse than her earlier tirade.

A young CIA analyst—Thompson, maybe? Max couldn't remember—sat at a laptop, photographing each document and running preliminary scans. The click of the camera shutter punctuated the quiet like a metronome counting down to judgment.

"This one," Sabine said suddenly, her voice tight. She held up a photograph of a man in a business suit shaking hands with someone Max recognized from intelligence briefings. "When was this taken?"

Thompson zoomed in on the metadata. "Three weeks ago. Brussels."

Sabine's jaw clenched. She set the photo down and picked up a financial ledger, her eyes scanning the columns of numbers. Her finger traced a line of transactions, then stopped. Her breathing changed—shallow, controlled.

"Max." His name came out quiet. Dangerous quiet.

He pushed off the wall. "Yeah?"

"Come here."

He approached the table. Sabine pointed to a series of account numbers, then to a corresponding document—a personnel roster with names highlighted in yellow.

"Do you see this?" She wasn't looking at him. Her eyes were fixed on the papers, but her knuckles had gone white where she gripped the edge of the table.

Max leaned closer. The account numbers were routing funds through a network of shell corporations. The names on the roster included mid-level officials from five different intelligence services. British. German. French. Two he didn't recognize.

"Jesus," Thompson whispered.

Sabine pulled another document from the stack—a communications log. Her hands were shaking now, just slightly. Max had never seen Sabine Voss's hands shake.

"This isn't just Viktor's network," she said. "This is..." She trailed off, spreading more documents across the table. A web of connections emerged. Corporate executives. Politicians. Military contractors. Each document linked to another, creating a pattern that made Max's stomach drop.

Sabine grabbed a red marker and began drawing lines between photographs, connecting faces to names to transactions. The marker squeaked against the glossy paper. Her movements became faster, more urgent, as the scope of what they were seeing crystallized.

"My God." She stepped back from the table, the marker falling from her fingers. "This goes back fifteen years. Maybe longer."

Thompson's face had gone pale. "Ma'am, if this is accurate—"

"It's accurate." Sabine's voice was hollow. She turned to look at Max for the first time since they'd entered the room. The fury in her eyes had transformed into something else. Something that looked almost like fear. "Roxana gave you everything. Names. Transactions. Communications. This is..." She gestured helplessly at the table.

"Proof," Max said.

"Proof of a coordinated espionage operation spanning multiple governments and private sectors." Sabine picked up a document with trembling hands. "They're not just stealing intelligence. They're trading it. Selling it. Creating a parallel information economy that operates completely outside official channels."

Max moved closer to the table, studying the web of connections. "How many people are involved?"

Thompson was typing frantically. "Based on these documents? Conservatively? Two hundred. Maybe more."

Sabine laughed—a sharp, bitter sound. "And we had no idea. None of us." She looked at Max again, and this time there was something new in her expression. Respect, maybe. Or the grudging acknowledgment of someone who'd been proven wrong. "You risked everything for this."

"Roxana risked everything," Max corrected.

"Roxana wouldn't have gotten near this without you." Sabine gathered the documents, her professional composure reassembling itself like armor. "This changes everything. The entire operation. The entire investigation." She paused, her fingers resting on a photograph of Viktor standing with three men Max didn't recognize. "We're not hunting one asset anymore. We're looking at a full-scale infiltration."

The weight of it settled over the room like a physical presence. Thompson had stopped typing, his eyes wide behind his glasses.

Sabine pulled out her phone. "I need to make some calls. Secure calls." She looked at Max. "You're still reckless. Still insubordinate. Still a pain in my ass."

"But?"

"But you just handed us the biggest intelligence coup in a decade." She moved toward the door, then stopped. "Get some rest. Both of you. When this hits headquarters, things are going to move fast."

She left, her footsteps echoing down the corridor.

Thompson let out a long breath. "Holy shit."

Max stared at the documents spread across the table—the evidence of a conspiracy so vast it made his previous missions seem like training exercises. Somewhere in Vienna, Roxana was in the wind, carrying secrets that could bring down governments.

And somewhere in this web of lies and betrayal, there was still a truth waiting to be uncovered.

His phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number: *One hour. Come alone.*

Max's blood went cold. He recognized the code. It was Roxana's emergency protocol.

She was reaching out.

And she was in trouble.

**Scene 4: Max is finally allowed to see ...**

**Scene 4: Max is finally allowed to see Roxana**

The hallway stretched longer than it should have, each footstep on the worn hardwood echoing too loudly in Max's ears. Sabine had given him ten minutes—a concession delivered with the warmth of a prison warden granting yard time.

The safe house bedroom was at the end of the corridor, third door on the left. Max counted them as he passed. One. Two. Three. His hand hesitated on the brass knob, suddenly cold despite the building's efficient heating.

He knocked softly. No answer.

"Roxana? It's me."

A pause, then her voice, barely audible: "Come in."

The room was spartan—a single bed with military-crisp white sheets, a wooden chair, a dresser with nothing on it. The window had been covered with blackout curtains, but afternoon light leaked around the edges in thin golden lines. The air smelled of institutional soap and something else—the faint, acrid scent of fear.

Roxana sat on the edge of the bed, still wearing the clothes from Vienna. Her hair, usually so carefully styled, hung loose around her shoulders. She'd washed her face; he could see water droplets still clinging to her hairline. Without makeup, she looked younger. More vulnerable.

She didn't look up when he entered.

Max closed the door behind him, the latch clicking with a finality that made his chest tighten. He wanted to cross the room, to pull her into his arms, but something in her posture—shoulders curved inward, hands clasped tight in her lap—kept him rooted near the door.

"They treating you okay?" he asked. Stupid question. Safe.

"They gave me tea." She gestured to an untouched cup on the nightstand, steam no longer rising from it. "English breakfast. Not Russian."

The observation landed like a stone between them.

Max moved closer, slowly, as if approaching something wild and wounded. The floorboard creaked under his weight. "Roxana—"

"I had a cat," she said suddenly, her voice flat. "Misha. A gray tabby. I've had him for six years. He waits by the door every evening at seven when I come home from work." Her fingers twisted together. "Who will feed him now?"

The mundane detail hit harder than any recrimination. Max sank into the wooden chair, its joints protesting. "We can arrange—"

"No." She finally looked at him, and the emptiness in her eyes made his breath catch. "You don't understand. There is no arrangement. There is no going back. My apartment, my job, my friends, my cat—" Her voice cracked on the last word. "Gone. All of it. Because I chose to walk out of that restaurant with you."

"You chose to do the right thing."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "The right thing." She stood abruptly, wrapping her arms around herself. "My mother is seventy-three. She lives in Novosibirsk. Every Sunday, I call her. What do I tell her now? 'Sorry, Mama, I'm a traitor to the Motherland, you'll never see me again'?"

Max rose, closing the distance between them. "You're not a traitor. You exposed criminals—"

"To you, they are criminals." Roxana's voice rose, trembling with suppressed emotion. "To Moscow, I am the criminal. To the FSB, to Viktor's people—" She pressed her palms against her temples. "Do you know what they do to defectors' families? The surveillance, the pressure, the—"

"We'll protect her. We can bring her out—"

"Stop!" The word came out as almost a shout. Roxana's composure finally shattered. Her shoulders shook, tears streaming down her face. "Stop making promises you cannot keep. Stop pretending this is anything other than what it is. I am burned. Finished. Everything I was, everything I built—I left it all on that Vienna street."

Max reached for her, and this time she didn't pull away. She collapsed against him, her body wracked with silent sobs. He wrapped his arms around her, feeling the violent tremors running through her frame. Her tears soaked into his shirt, warm and wet.

"I'm sorry," he whispered into her hair. "God, Roxana, I'm so sorry."

They sank together onto the edge of the bed. Roxana's fingers clutched at his jacket, holding on as if he were the only solid thing in a tilting world. Max held her tighter, his own throat constricting with guilt that tasted like copper.

He'd done this to her. Yes, she'd made the choice—but he'd pushed her toward it, manipulated the circumstances, played on her conscience and her attraction to him. The intelligence was good, Sabine had said. The best they'd had in years. But what was it worth? What was any of it worth against the weight of this woman's destroyed life?

"I didn't even pack a photograph," Roxana said against his chest, her voice muffled and broken. "Not one picture of my mother. Of my life. I have nothing."

"You have me." The words came out before Max could stop them.

Roxana pulled back slightly, looking up at him with red-rimmed eyes. "For how long? Until the next operation? The next asset who needs running?" She touched his face, her fingers cold against his jaw. "This is what you do, Max. You collect broken people and use their pieces to build your cases."

"That's not—" But he couldn't finish the denial. Wasn't it true? How many assets had he run over the years? How many lives had he disrupted, redirected, destroyed in service of the mission?

"I'm not sorry I did it," Roxana said quietly. "The network Viktor built—it needed to be stopped. People were dying. But don't ask me to pretend it doesn't cost everything. Don't ask me to be brave about losing my entire world."

Max cupped her face in his hands, thumbs brushing away tears that kept falling. "I won't. And I won't leave you alone in this. Whatever comes next—"

"You can't promise that either."

"I can promise to try."

Roxana's laugh was watery, exhausted. "The American optimist."

"The Russian realist."

She leaned her forehead against his, and they stayed like that, breathing together in the sparse room. Outside, Max could hear the muffled sounds of the safe house—footsteps, a door closing, the hum of secure communications equipment. The machinery of intelligence grinding forward.

"What happens now?" Roxana asked.

"Now you rest. Tomorrow, Sabine will want to debrief you properly. Then... then we figure out what your new life looks like."

"A new life." She said it like a foreign phrase, testing the shape of it. "Who will I be?"

"Whoever you want to be."

"Liar." But there was no heat in it. She pulled away, wiping her eyes with the back of her hand. "You should go. They're probably timing you."

Max stood reluctantly. At the door, he paused. "The cat. Misha. Give me your keys and address. I'll make a call. Someone will look after him."

Roxana's expression softened slightly. "That's a security risk."

"I don't care."

She almost smiled. Almost. "Thank you."

Max left her there, sitting on the edge of the anonymous bed in the anonymous room, looking small and lost and impossibly brave. The door closed behind him with a soft click.

In the hallway, he leaned against the wall and closed his eyes, Roxana's tears still damp on his shirt, the weight of what he'd done settling into his bones like lead.

Sabine was waiting at the end of the corridor, arms crossed, expression unreadable.

"Time's up," she said.

Max nodded and followed her back toward the debriefing room, leaving Roxana alone with the ghost of her old life and the terrifying blank space of her future.

**Scene 5: During a joint debriefing, Sar...**

**Scene 5: During a joint debriefing, Sabine questions Roxana extensively about Viktor's network and her knowledge of his operations**

The briefing room smelled of strong coffee and tension. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting harsh shadows across the long conference table where Sabine Voss sat with her laptop open and a legal pad covered in precise handwriting. A digital recorder sat between her and Roxana, its red light blinking steadily.

Max leaned against the wall near the door, arms crossed, watching. A CIA debriefer named Garrett occupied the corner, fingers flying across his keyboard as he documented everything.

Sabine hadn't looked at Max once in the past forty minutes.

"Let's go back to the Prague meeting," Sabine said, her voice clinical. "March 2023. You said Viktor met with someone from the German finance ministry."

Roxana sat perfectly straight in her chair, hands folded on the table. She'd changed into borrowed clothes—dark jeans and a plain sweater that made her look younger, more vulnerable. But her eyes were sharp, focused.

"Not from the ministry. A contractor who worked with them. There's a difference."

"Name?"

"He introduced himself as Klaus. Viktor called him something else later, when he thought I wasn't listening." Roxana paused, her gaze distant. "Dieter. Dieter Hauptmann."

Garrett's typing stopped. Sabine's pen froze mid-note.

"You're certain?" Sabine asked.

"I'm certain of what I heard." Roxana's voice remained steady. "Viktor had been drinking. We were in the hotel suite. He made a call from the bedroom, but the door was open. He said, 'Dieter, you paranoid bastard, using fake names with me now?'"

Sabine exchanged a glance with Garrett, who was already pulling up something on his screen. Max shifted his weight, recognizing the significance even if he didn't know the details.

"Hauptmann has been on our radar for eighteen months," Sabine said quietly. "We've never been able to place him anywhere definitively."

"I can place him in Prague. Vienna twice. Once in Zurich." Roxana ticked them off on her fingers. "I have dates. I kept a journal."

The room went very still.

"You kept a journal," Sabine repeated, her tone carefully neutral. "Of Viktor's meetings."

"Not of the meetings. Of my life." Roxana met Sabine's gaze without flinching. "A woman in my position learns to notice things. To remember. It's survival."

Max found himself standing straighter. This was a different Roxana than the frightened woman in the warehouse, different even from the determined one who'd made her choice in the car. This Roxana was revealing herself layer by layer—intelligent, observant, strategic.

Sabine leaned forward slightly. "What else did you notice?"

"Viktor keeps two phones. The iPhone is for show—business calls, restaurants, his legitimate operations. The Samsung is encrypted. He only uses it in private, or what he thinks is private." Roxana's mouth curved slightly, not quite a smile. "He underestimated how much I pay attention. The Samsung contacts are coded. 'Architect' is someone in Brussels. 'Gardener' is Moscow. 'Chef' is the one he's most careful about—always steps outside, always speaks in Russian."

"Can you identify any of these people?" Garrett asked, speaking for the first time.

"Some. The Architect met us for dinner once in Brussels. Viktor called him by name then—Alain Mercier. He works for the European Commission, something to do with infrastructure contracts."

Sabine was writing rapidly now, her earlier coldness replaced by intense focus. "What about the financial structure? Did Viktor ever discuss how money moved through his network?"

"Not directly. But I saw documents sometimes. He was careless when he'd been drinking, left his laptop open." Roxana's voice dropped slightly. "Shell companies in Cyprus, Cayman Islands, Singapore. Money moving in circles. He had a diagram once, on his screen. Like a web, with nodes and connections."

"Could you recreate it?"

Roxana looked at her hands, then back up. "I think so. Not perfectly, but the general structure. I have a good memory for patterns."

Max watched Sabine's expression shift—the grudging respect breaking through her professional mask. This wasn't just a frightened trophy wife looking for escape. This was an intelligence asset who'd been gathering information for years, whether she'd consciously realized it or not.

"Why didn't you come to us before?" Sabine asked, and for the first time, there was something almost gentle in her voice.

Roxana was quiet for a long moment. The fluorescent lights hummed. Somewhere in the safe house, a door closed.

"Because I was afraid," she said finally. "And because I didn't know if I could trust anyone. Viktor has people everywhere. He's told me that since the beginning—that he has friends in every government, every agency. That no one could protect me if I ran."

"And now?"

Roxana looked at Max, then back to Sabine. "Now I'm more afraid of what happens if I don't run. And I think..." She paused, choosing her words carefully. "I think maybe I've been preparing to run for longer than I admitted to myself. Noticing things. Remembering. Building a case in my head."

Sabine closed her laptop with a soft click. "Roxana, I'm going to be direct with you. What you know, what you can provide—it's valuable. Extremely valuable. But it also makes you a target. Viktor won't stop looking for you. Neither will the people he works with."

"I know."

"We can protect you. Witness protection, new identity, relocation. But it means leaving everything behind. Completely."

"Everything I had was built on lies," Roxana said quietly. "I'm ready to leave it."

Sabine nodded slowly, then finally looked at Max. Her expression was complicated—still angry, but also acknowledging something unspoken.

"Take a break," she said. "Fifteen minutes. Then we're going to go through everything again, this time with our Russian desk specialist on video call. It's going to be a long night."

Roxana stood, steadier than she'd been hours ago. Max pushed off from the wall, ready to escort her out, but she paused at the door.

"Ms. Voss?" Roxana's voice was clear. "Thank you for listening. For believing me."

Sabine's expression softened fractionally. "Thank you for being brave enough to speak."

As they left the briefing room, Max heard Garrett's low whistle and Sabine's murmured response: "This changes everything."

In the hallway, Roxana leaned against the wall, closing her eyes briefly. Max stood nearby, giving her space but staying close.

"You did well in there," he said.

She opened her eyes, looking at him with something that might have been amusement. "You sound surprised."

"Not surprised. Impressed."

"I've spent five years watching, listening, surviving." Her voice was soft but firm. "I learned to be more than what Viktor wanted me to be. More than what anyone saw."

Before Max could respond, footsteps approached from the far end of the hall. Sabine appeared, phone in hand, her expression urgent.

"Break's over," she said. "We just got word. Viktor's people are making moves. We need everything Roxana knows, and we need it now."

The determination in Roxana's eyes hardened to something stronger.

"Then let's get back to work," she said, and walked back into the briefing room with her head high.

**Scene 6: Late that night, Sabine private...**

**Scene 6: Late that night, Sabine privately tells Max that Roxana will need to enter witness protection**

The safe house had settled into uneasy quiet by the time Sabine knocked on Max's door. Through the frosted glass of the temporary office she'd commandeered, he could see her silhouette—rigid, controlled, waiting.

"Come in, Max."

He found her standing by the window, looking out at the dark Austrian countryside. A single desk lamp cast long shadows across the sparse room. The smell of stale coffee hung in the air, mixing with the faint scent of her perfume—something expensive and cold, like her demeanor.

She didn't turn around. "Close the door."

Max obeyed, his gut tightening. This wasn't another debriefing. Those had ended hours ago, with Sabine's clipped acknowledgment that the documents Roxana had secured were "actionable intelligence." High praise from a woman who rationed compliments like ammunition.

"Sit."

"I'd rather stand."

Sabine's shoulders tensed, but she continued staring into the darkness. "The documents Roxana obtained have been verified. The network is larger than we imagined—politicians, military contractors, tech executives. All compromised. All vulnerable."

"Good."

"Good?" She turned then, and the lamplight caught the exhaustion in her eyes. "Max, do you understand what you've done? What *she's* done? There are people in three countries who want her dead right now. People with resources that make Viktor look like a street-level dealer."

Max's jaw tightened. "Then we protect her."

"We will." Sabine moved to the desk, her fingers drumming once against the wood—a rare tell of agitation. "She'll enter witness protection. New identity, new location. Probably the States. Definitely nowhere near Europe."

The words hit him like a physical blow, though he'd known they were coming. Had known since the moment Roxana handed over those files that this was the logical conclusion. The only conclusion.

"When?"

"Seventy-two hours. Maybe less, depending on how quickly the threat assessment develops." Sabine's gaze pinned him. "And Max, I need to be absolutely clear about this: once she enters the program, all contact ends. No calls. No emails. No accidentally running into her in some café in Prague. It's over."

"She hasn't agreed to this."

"She will. Because she's smart enough to understand that it's either witness protection or a bullet." Sabine's voice softened, just slightly. "I've seen the way you look at her. And I've seen the way she looks at you. Which is why I'm having this conversation now, privately, instead of in front of the team."

Max's hands curled into fists at his sides. Through the window behind Sabine, he could see the safe house's perimeter lights cutting geometric patterns into the night. Armed guards walked their routes with mechanical precision. Everything controlled. Everything contained.

"There has to be another way."

"There isn't." Sabine moved closer, her expression hardening. "You want to know what happens if you try to follow her? If you compromise her location? You get her killed. You get yourself killed. And you burn every asset we have in the field because our enemies will know exactly how sloppy we've become."

"I'm not asking to compromise—"

"Yes, you are." Her voice cracked like a whip. "That's exactly what you're asking. You're asking for an exception. For special treatment. For the rules not to apply because you have *feelings*."

The contempt in that last word stung more than Max wanted to admit.

Sabine returned to the window, her reflection ghostly in the glass. "I've been doing this for seventeen years. Do you know how many operatives I've seen burn out because they couldn't separate the job from their personal lives? How many good agents I've lost because they thought they could have both?"

"And how many did you lose because they had nothing left to fight for?"

The silence stretched between them, heavy and suffocating. Outside, an owl called into the darkness.

When Sabine spoke again, her voice was barely above a whisper. "I had someone once. An analyst. Brilliant mind, terrible tradecraft. We tried to make it work." She touched the window, her fingers leaving faint prints on the cold glass. "He died in Beirut because I was three minutes late to an extraction. Three minutes, Max. I was saying goodbye to a source, securing one last piece of intel. Three minutes."

Max felt something shift in his chest—not sympathy, exactly, but recognition. The weight Sabine carried wasn't just professional. It was personal. Ancient. Unhealed.

"I'm sorry."

"Don't be sorry. Be smart." She turned, and her eyes were flint. "You're at a crossroads. Follow protocol, lose Roxana, but keep her alive. Or try to find 'another way' and watch her die because you were too selfish to let her go."

"Those aren't the only options."

"They're the only ones that matter."

Max moved to the door, his hand on the knob. The metal was cold beneath his palm, solid and real. Everything else felt like quicksand.

"The enemies looking for us," he said quietly. "How long before they find this location?"

Sabine's expression flickered—surprise, then calculation. "We're secure here for now. Why?"

"Because if they're already searching, then the seventy-two-hour window might be optimistic."

"We have protocols—"

"Protocols didn't stop them from finding us in Vienna. Didn't stop them from tracking Roxana to the embassy." Max met her gaze. "You said the network is bigger than we imagined. Which means the leaks are bigger too. Which means someone, somewhere in our chain of command, is compromised."

Sabine's silence was answer enough.

Max opened the door, cold air from the hallway rushing in. "I'll follow your protocols, Sabine. I'll say goodbye when the time comes. But until then, I'm going to make damn sure Roxana survives long enough to make it to witness protection."

"Max—"

"And if I find out someone on our side is feeding information to the people hunting her?" He paused in the doorway, his voice dropping to something dark and certain. "Protocol won't save them from me."

He left before Sabine could respond, the door clicking shut behind him with quiet finality.

In the hallway, Max leaned against the wall, his heart hammering. Through a window at the corridor's end, he could see the guest room where Roxana was sleeping—or trying to. A single light burned in her window.

Seventy-two hours. Maybe less.

The dread settled over him like a familiar coat, but beneath it, something else stirred. Resolve. Cold and sharp as a blade.

Sabine was right about one thing: he was at a crossroads.

But she was wrong about the choices available to him.

Max pushed off the wall and headed toward the safe house's communications room, his mind already working through the angles, the contacts, the favors he could call in. Somewhere in the web of intelligence and counter-intelligence, there had to be a third option. A way to keep Roxana safe without losing her completely.

He just had to find it before their enemies found them first.

Behind him, Sabine's office light went dark.

The clock was already ticking.
