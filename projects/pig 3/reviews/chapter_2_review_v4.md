## Chapter 2 Review: Arnie's Urban Adventure

1.  **Internal Consistency**

*   Issue: Scene 2 mentions Arnie having "scales, a dazzling emerald green," and being an "overgrown lizard." Later, in Scene 6, Arnie is described as having a "warm, furry body" and being covered in "sun-baked fur." This creates a conflict in Arnie's physical description. Is Arnie scaled and reptilian, or furry and mammalian?
*   Issue: In Scene 2, Johnny uses a jump rope as a makeshift leash for Arnie. Given Arnie's apparent strength (digging up a flowerbed with one swipe), it seems unlikely a jump rope would be an effective restraint.

2.  **Clarity**

*   No issues found.

3.  **Plot Holes**

*   Issue: In Scene 1, Johnny's backyard is described as weedy and neglected, to the point that "Nobody ever comes back here". Yet, in the same scene, Mrs. Rodriguez appears there, "peering at them from the edge of the ivy." What was Mrs. Rodriguez doing in a place where "nobody ever comes"?

4.  **Redundancy**

*   No issues found.

5.  **Flow and Transitions**

*   No issues found.

6.  **Actionable Fixes**

1.  In Scene 2, revise Arnie's description to consistently reflect either scales or fur. Choose one and maintain it throughout the book to avoid confusion. For example, if scales are chosen, change "furry body" to "scaly body" in Scene 6.
2.  In Scene 2, change the jump rope to a stronger, more believable restraint, like a dog leash, given Arnie's strength. "Arnie, already buzzing with pent-up energy, strained against the makeshift leash Johnny had fashioned from an old *dog leash*."
3.  In Scene 1, clarify why Mrs. Rodriguez is near the hidden backyard. Add a reason for her presence to avoid the plot hole. Example: "Nobody ever comes back here *except to tend the neglected section where the dumpsters are located*. Mrs. Rodriguez..." Or, change the description of the space to one that gets occasional traffic, for example, "Nobody ever comes back here *except to hang laundry on the lines.* Mrs. Rodriguez was peering at them..."
