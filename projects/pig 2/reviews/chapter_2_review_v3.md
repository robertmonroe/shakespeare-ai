## Chapter 2 Review:

1. **Internal Consistency**
   - Issue: The text states, "The air smelled vaguely of old pizza and unwashed socks, a scent Johnny barely registered anymore." later on "What about that… that smell?” She wrinkled her nose delicately." and in Scene 4: "The hallway reeked. Not of garbage or mildew, but of something…farm-like. Johnny sprayed a liberal dose of "Ocean Breeze" air freshener, the sickly sweet scent clashing horribly with the underlying aroma." This is inconsistent with Johnny barely noticing smells.
   - Issue: In Scene 3, Dad remembers Johnny sleepwalking and battling a toaster with a spatula. Yet, in Scene 6, Mom is instantly convinced by his appendix pain story, and Dad doesn't question it further, even though it's clearly a lie. This feels inconsistent.
   - Issue: Scene 5 ends with "What in tarnation is going on here?" A booming voice came from the door way. Mrs Rosenbaum marched into the scene, her eyes landing on Arnie and Johnny, before she pointed a wrinkled finger at Johnny's father, "I want this fixed immediately young man. I have a mahjong game to host tonight." Then Scene 6 begins with "The bathroom door creaked open, and Mom and Dad stood silhouetted against the hall light. Dad held a wrench, his brow furrowed. “Johnny? We heard… noises. And a lot of water.”" This doesn't connect to the previous scene at all.
2. **Clarity**
   - Issue: In Scene 3 when Mom and Dad are investigating Johnny's room, Johnny says he was "Exercising with… animals? Are you alright, son? Are you hurt?” "No! No animals! I mean... I was imagining I was wrestling a bear! For motivation! Method exercising!" This is confusing.
   - Issue: Scene 5 - There is no setup for why Mrs. Rosenbaum is below him. She simply appears.
3. **Plot Holes**
   - Issue: How did Johnny manage to get Arnie into the bathtub without his parents noticing? It is hard to believe he could sneak a pig to the bathroom and cause so much noise without his parents knowing anything.
   - Issue: How does Johnny expect to keep a pig hidden long term, especially as it grows? This isn't addressed, making his actions seem short-sighted.
4. **Redundancy**
   - Issue: The phrase "This was going to be harder than he thought" appears more than once, diminishing its impact.
   - Issue: The repetition of Johnny thinking he needs a new strategy could be consolidated.
5. **Flow and Transitions**
   - Issue: Scene 3 ends abruptly.
   - Issue: The jump between scenes 4 and 5 is jarring. One moment, Johnny's parents are about to discover Arnie; the next, he's in the bathroom. How did he get Arnie from his room to the bathroom without being seen?
6. **Actionable Fixes**
   1.  In Scene 1, revise the description of the apartment's smell to include a base layer of the more neutral scent the character is used to, with an added layer of "something new and earthy" he now has to deal with. This will make his sensitivity to the "pig" smell more believable later.
   2.  In Scene 3, either remove the reference to Johnny sleepwalking battling a toaster or have Dad at least mention it, prompting Mom to question Johnny's new "illness."
   3.  Change Scene 3 so that the last line is not "This ‘mental dojo’ and imaginary bear wrestling is keeping us awake." Instead, transition into Mrs. Rosenbaum running up and yelling at Johnny's parents to lead into scene 5 smoothly.
   4.  Revise Scene 3's explanation of "Exercising with animals" and "Wrestling with a bear" to be less confusing.
   5.  Add a brief paragraph to Scene 4 explaining that Mrs. Rosenbaum lives downstairs and that the layout of the building is one apartment on each floor. Add information about noise complaints from the upstairs neighbor.
   6.  In scene 4 remove mention of the "straw" under his door.
   7.  Add a scene showing Johnny getting Arnie from his room to the bathroom, demonstrating how he snuck the pig past his parents.
   8.  Scene 5 - add information that makes it less of a plot hole that Mrs. Rosenbaum shows up screaming at them to fix the ceiling.
   9.  In scene 5, change the ending so that it leads more fluidly into scene 6. Consider removing scene 6 entirely as it contributes very little.
   10. Replace redundant instances of "This was going to be harder than he thought" with variations like "He knew this was just the beginning of his troubles" or "He was starting to realize how difficult this would be."
   11. Consolidate the lines of Johnny thinking that he needs a new strategy, making the character a bit smarter.
   12. Cut Scene 6 entirely as it isn't needed. The scene adds nothing to the story.
