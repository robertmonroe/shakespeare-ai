## Chapter 3 Review: "Hog Wild: A Graceland Pig Tale"

1. **Internal Consistency**

*   **Issue:** Percy's fur is described as "partially-dyed-black". The previous chapter indicates this was Daisy's intention, but it is not explicitly stated that she was successful in dyeing his fur. If only the intention was there, it should be rephrased to indicate that Daisy attempted to dye it.
*   **Issue:** In the last scene, Farmer John states "He owes me a blue ribbon!". This is the first mention of the County Fair.

2. **Clarity**

*   No issues found.

3. **Plot Holes**

*   **Issue:** In Scene 4, Farmer John finds a crumpled map that indicates that Percy is heading to Memphis. It would be more plausible if he found the "hand-drawn poster" that Daisy put up as he knows how to read and would not jump to Memphis as quickly as he did based on a crude map.

4. **Redundancy**

*   No issues found.

5. **Flow and Transitions**

*   **Issue:** The chapter feels slightly disjointed. It jumps from rehearsal to performance to Farmer John to performance back to a standoff. While all the scenes are necessary, the placement is not smooth. It would be helpful to move the Iowa scene closer to the end so that the cliffhanger is more obvious.

6. **Actionable Fixes**

1.  **Scene 1, Paragraph 1:** Change "now partially-dyed-black fur" to "now *attempted* to be dyed black fur" or similar wording to reflect that Daisy only attempted to dye his fur.
2.  **Scene 4, Paragraph 5:** Change "lying near Percy’s empty pen" to "lying near Percy's empty pen" **lying amongst the mud.**
3.  **Scene 4, Paragraph 5:** Change "It was a map, drawn in charcoal..." to "It was a hand-drawn poster, advertising 'The Swine-King', Memphis".
4.  **Scene 2:** Combine scene 2 and 3.
5.  **Move Scene 4** to be the second last or last scene in this chapter to create a more compelling cliffhanger.
6.  **Scene 6, Paragraph 3:** Change "He owes me a blue ribbon!" to "He's going to win me a blue ribbon!"
