## Chapter 2: The Reconnection and Family Resistance

**Scene 1: After days of staring at Silvi...**

# **Scene 1: After days of staring at Silvia's Facebook profile**

Robert's cursor hovered over the "Message" button for the fourteenth time that week. The glow from his computer screen cast blue shadows across his home office, illuminating the framed photo of Margaret that still sat on his desk. Outside, February rain drummed against the window, matching the erratic rhythm of his heartbeat.

*This is ridiculous,* he thought. *You're sixty years old, not sixteen.*

Yet his palms were sweating like he was sixteen again, standing outside Silvia's parents' house in that sweltering Chicago summer, working up the courage to knock on her door.

He glanced at the clock: 11:47 PM. Too late to send a message. Too desperate. He should close the laptop, go to bed, forget this whole thing.

Instead, his fingers moved across the keyboard before his rational mind could intervene:

*Silvia, I've thought about our conversation at the cemetery many times since that afternoon. I hope this message doesn't seem too forward, but I wanted to tell you how meaningful it was to see you again. I've often wondered over the years how life treated you. I hope you've been well. - Robert*

He read it three times, deleted "many times," added it back, then removed "I hope this message doesn't seem too forward" as too apologetic. His finger trembled over the send button.

*Margaret wouldn't want you to be alone,* his daughter Sarah had said at Christmas, though her voice had carried an edge of concern rather than encouragement.

He clicked send before he could second-guess himself again.

The message whooshed away into the digital ether. Robert stared at the screen, his heart hammering. What had he done? What if she didn't respond? What if she thought he was a lonely old man chasing ghosts?

He forced himself to close the laptop and head upstairs, though sleep seemed impossible now.

---

Three hundred miles away, Silvia stood at her kitchen counter, nursing a cup of chamomile tea she'd made to help her sleep. The house felt too quiet these days—had felt that way for the eight months since Javier's funeral. Her phone sat beside her, its screen dark.

She'd been checking Facebook obsessively for five days, though she wouldn't admit it to anyone. Not to her son Miguel, who already watched her with worried eyes. Not to her sister Rosa, who'd asked too many pointed questions about "that man from the cemetery."

The phone buzzed. Her hand jerked, nearly knocking over her tea.

A notification glowed on the screen: *Robert Morrison sent you a message.*

Silvia's breath caught. She set down her mug with trembling hands and opened the message, reading it once, twice, three times. Each word felt like a small gift, carefully chosen.

*Meaningful.* He'd called their encounter meaningful.

She should wait until morning to respond. That would be the sensible thing. The proper thing. She imagined Javier's gentle voice: *Mija, don't seem too eager.*

But Javier was gone. And Robert's message glowed on her screen like a candle in a dark room.

Her thumbs moved across the screen:

*Robert, I'm so glad you wrote. I've been thinking about our conversation too. More than I probably should admit. It was wonderful to see you, even under such sad circumstances. I'd love to hear about your life. - Silvia*

She hit send before her courage failed, then immediately wondered if "more than I probably should admit" was too much. Too revealing.

The three dots appeared almost instantly. He was still awake. He was typing.

Her heart performed a complicated dance in her chest—part anxiety, part something she hadn't felt in decades. Something that made her feel simultaneously guilty and alive.

*I'm glad I'm not the only one who couldn't stop thinking about it. I know this might sound strange, but talking to you felt like finding a piece of myself I'd forgotten existed. How have you been? Really?*

Silvia pulled out a kitchen chair and sat down, her tea forgotten. Her fingers flew across the screen:

*Some days are harder than others. The house feels too big now. My son Miguel worries about me, which makes me feel like a burden. But seeing you... it reminded me of a time when everything felt possible. Does that make sense?*

*Perfect sense. I look at old photos sometimes and barely recognize that young man who thought he could conquer the world. But when I saw you at the cemetery, for just a moment, I felt like him again.*

Silvia found herself smiling, really smiling, for the first time in months. She glanced at the clock—12:23 AM. She should go to bed. Instead, she typed:

*Do you remember the night we snuck out to Navy Pier? You were so worried we'd get caught.*

*I was terrified your father would kill me! You were the brave one. You were always the brave one.*

*I don't feel very brave these days.*

The response came quickly: *Neither do I. But maybe we could be brave together?*

Silvia stared at those words, her throat tight. The kitchen suddenly felt warmer, less empty. She could almost hear the echo of her younger self's laughter, feel the ghost of Robert's hand in hers as they walked along Lake Michigan all those years ago.

*I'd like that,* she typed.

---

Over the next three days, their messages grew longer, more frequent. Robert found himself checking his phone between patient appointments, during lunch, late at night when sleep eluded him. Each notification from Silvia sent a jolt of anticipation through him that he hadn't felt in years.

They traded stories about their children—Robert's Sarah and Thomas, Silvia's Miguel and Elena. They shared photos: grandchildren's birthdays, family vacations, the ordinary moments that had filled their separate lives.

But they also shared the harder truths. Robert confessed how he'd held Margaret's hand in the hospital, watching cancer steal her piece by piece. Silvia described Javier's sudden heart attack, how she'd found him in the garden, how she sometimes still set two places at the table by mistake.

*Do you feel guilty?* Silvia asked on the third night. *For being happy to talk to someone?*

Robert sat in his office, rain still pattering against the window, and considered his answer carefully.

*Yes. Every time I smile at one of your messages, there's a voice that says I should still be grieving. That Margaret deserves more time. But there's another voice—quieter, but growing stronger—that says she'd want me to live. Really live, not just exist. Does that make me terrible?*

*If you're terrible, then so am I. I find myself looking forward to your messages. Planning what I'll say. Laughing at things you write. And then I feel like I'm betraying Javier's memory.*

*Maybe we're not betraying them. Maybe we're just... finding our way back to ourselves.*

There was a long pause before Silvia's response appeared:

*Robert, would you want to meet for dinner? Somewhere quiet where we could talk in person?*

His hands froze above the keyboard. This was different from messages, from the safety of screens and distance. This was real. This was a choice.

He thought of Margaret's photo on his desk. He thought of his daughter Sarah's concerned frown. He thought of all the reasons this was too soon, too complicated, too much.

Then he thought of Silvia's smile at the cemetery, the way forty-two years had dissolved in an instant.

*I'd love that. When?*

*Saturday? There's a small Mexican restaurant in Rockford, halfway between us. Casa del Sol. 7 PM?*

Robert's heart pounded as he typed his response:

*I'll be there.*

After he sent the message, he sat back in his chair, staring at the screen. The rain had stopped, and moonlight filtered through the clouds, casting silver light across his desk. He picked up Margaret's photo, running his thumb along the frame.

"I hope you understand," he whispered to her image. "I hope you'd want this for me."

The house remained silent, but somehow the silence felt less heavy than before.

Three hundred miles away, Silvia clutched her phone to her chest, her eyes squeezed shut. She'd done it. She'd asked him. And he'd said yes.

"Forgive me, Javier," she murmured into the empty kitchen. "But I need to know if this is real. I need to know if some part of me still exists beyond grief."

Her phone buzzed one more time:

*I'm looking forward to it. More than I can say. Sleep well, Silvia.*

She typed back

**Scene 2: Robert and Silvia meet for din...**

**Scene 2: Robert and Silvia meet for dinner at Casa Guadalupe**

The parking lot of Casa Guadalupe was nearly full when Robert arrived fifteen minutes early. He sat in his truck, hands gripping the steering wheel, watching families stream through the entrance beneath the cheerful string of papel picado banners that fluttered in the evening breeze. His heart hammered against his ribs like it had forty-three years ago when he'd picked Silvia up for their first real date.

*This is different*, he reminded himself. *We're not kids anymore.*

He checked his reflection in the rearview mirror, smoothing down hair that had gone mostly silver. The face looking back at him seemed too old for the butterflies in his stomach.

When Silvia's silver Honda pulled into a spot three spaces down, Robert's breath caught. She emerged wearing a simple turquoise blouse and dark jeans, her hair swept back in a way that made him remember summer nights and stolen kisses. She spotted him immediately, and the smile that crossed her face was tentative but genuine.

They met halfway across the parking lot.

"Hi," she said softly.

"Hi yourself." Robert resisted the urge to embrace her, settling instead for an awkward half-wave. "I hope this place is okay. It's been around forever, and the food's—"

"I love it," Silvia interrupted, her smile widening. "Miguel used to bring his abuela here every Sunday."

The mention of her late husband's name created a small, weighted pause between them. Robert nodded, filing away the detail—*Miguel was a good son*—and gestured toward the entrance.

Inside, Casa Guadalupe wrapped them in warmth and noise. The scent of cilantro, lime, and sizzling carne asada filled the air. Colorful serapes decorated the walls alongside family photographs spanning decades. A hostess who couldn't have been older than twenty led them to a corner booth with cracked vinyl seats and a wobbling table that Robert immediately steadied with a folded napkin.

"Some things never change," Silvia laughed, watching him work. "You always had to fix everything."

"Occupational hazard of being a contractor." He slid into the booth across from her, suddenly hyperaware of the intimate size of the table. Their knees nearly touched underneath.

A waitress appeared with menus and a bowl of warm tortilla chips, rattling off the evening specials in a practiced rhythm before disappearing again.

Silvia reached for a chip, then hesitated, her hand hovering over the bowl. "I'm nervous," she admitted. "Isn't that silly? After all those messages back and forth, I'm sitting here nervous as a teenager."

"If it helps, my hands haven't stopped shaking since I pulled into the parking lot." Robert held up his right hand as evidence, watching it tremble slightly.

She laughed—a real laugh, bright and unguarded—and the sound of it unlocked something in his chest. He found himself laughing too, and just like that, the nervousness began to dissolve.

They ordered without much thought—enchiladas verdes for her, carne guisada for him—and then the conversation began to flow like water finding its natural course.

Silvia told him about her daughter Rosa, a nurse in Houston with twin boys who kept her running. "She calls me every day, sometimes twice. I think she worries I'm lonely in that big house by myself."

"Are you?" Robert asked. "Lonely?"

Silvia's fingers traced the condensation on her water glass. "Yes," she said simply. "But not in the way she thinks. It's not about being alone. It's about being without..." She trailed off, and Robert saw the familiar shadow cross her face—the one he recognized from his own mirror.

"I know," he said quietly. "Margaret used to say I was terrible company, always underfoot. Now the house is so quiet I leave the TV on just to hear voices."

"How long were you married?"

"Thirty-eight years. You?"

"Forty-one." Silvia's smile was sad and proud at once. "He was a good man, Robert. Patient. Kind. He loved me even when I was difficult."

Robert heard what she wasn't saying—the same thing he felt about Margaret. *I loved them. I really did.* "Tell me about him," he said.

So she did. She told him about Miguel Sr., who had worked for the city's water department and coached Little League for twenty years. Who made her laugh with terrible puns and never forgot their anniversary. Who had fought pancreatic cancer with quiet dignity and made her promise not to spend the rest of her life in mourning.

In return, Robert shared stories about Margaret—her addiction to crossword puzzles, her insistence on Christmas decorations the day after Thanksgiving, the way she'd hummed while cooking. How she'd made him a better man, softer around the edges.

Their food arrived, steam rising from the plates, but neither of them ate much at first. They were too busy talking, the words tumbling out like they'd been stored up for decades.

"Do you remember that night at the lake?" Silvia asked suddenly, her eyes bright with memory. "When you tried to teach me to skip stones?"

Robert grinned. "You were terrible at it."

"I was not! I got three skips once."

"After about a hundred tries."

She threw a wadded napkin at him, and he caught it reflexively, both of them laughing. The couple at the next table glanced over with indulgent smiles.

"I thought about that summer a lot over the years," Silvia said, her voice dropping lower. "Especially when things got hard. I'd wonder what you were doing, if you were happy, if you ever..." She stopped, color rising in her cheeks.

"If I ever thought about you?" Robert finished. "All the time, Silvia. Even when I shouldn't have."

The admission hung between them, honest and dangerous. Silvia's eyes glistened, and she blinked rapidly.

"I kept your letters," she whispered. "In a box in my closet. I never told anyone."

Robert's throat tightened. "I kept yours too. In my workshop, behind some old paint cans where Margaret wouldn't find them. Not because—" He struggled for the right words. "Not because I was hiding anything wrong. Just because they were mine. From before."

"From when we were different people."

"Were we, though?" Robert leaned forward slightly. "Different people?"

Silvia studied his face, her expression unreadable. Then, slowly, she shook her head. "No. I don't think we were. I think we were just... interrupted."

The word settled over them like a revelation. Interrupted. Not ended. Not finished. Just paused for forty-two years while they lived other lives, loved other people, built other families.

Robert reached across the table, his hand stopping just short of hers. "Is it wrong that I'm happy right now? Sitting here with you?"

Silvia's breath hitched. She looked down at the small space between their hands, then back up at his face. "If it is, then I'm wrong too."

Her fingers moved the final inch, touching his. The contact was electric, familiar and foreign all at once.

Then guilt crashed over Robert like a wave. He saw Margaret in the hospital bed, her hand in his, making him promise to keep living. But this—sitting in a restaurant, holding another woman's hand, feeling his heart race with something other than grief—was this what she'd meant?

Silvia must have seen it in his face because she pulled her hand back gently. "I'm sorry," she said. "This is too fast. Too soon."

"No, it's not—" Robert started, but she was already gathering her purse.

"I should go. This was lovely, really, but I need to..." She stood, fumbling with her napkin.

Robert stood too, panic rising. "Silvia, wait. Please."

She paused, her eyes swimming with unshed tears. "I felt guilty all day about looking forward to this. About being excited to see you. And then I get here and it's wonderful and easy and I forget to feel guilty, and then I remember and it's worse. Do you understand?"

"Yes." The word came out rough. "God, yes. I understand completely."

They stood there in the middle of Casa Guadalupe, surrounded by the clatter of dishes and the chatter of happy families, two people caught between grief and hope, past and present.

"I don't want to leave," Silvia said finally. "But I don't know how to stay and not feel like I'm betraying everyone I love."

Robert nodded slowly. "What if we just... took it

**Scene 3: During a walk along the River ...**

# **Scene 3: During a walk along the River Walk after dinner**

The evening air had cooled just enough to be comfortable as Robert and Silvia descended the stone steps to the River Walk. Above them, strings of lights began to glow against the deepening twilight, their reflections dancing on the dark water like scattered stars. The dinner had stretched past two hours, neither of them wanting it to end, until the waiter had politely suggested they might enjoy continuing their conversation outside.

Robert's hand hovered near Silvia's elbow as they navigated the uneven pathway, not quite touching but close enough that he could feel the warmth radiating from her skin. The gesture felt both familiar and foreign—a muscle memory from four decades ago colliding with the uncertainty of who they were now.

"I can't believe this place," Silvia said, her voice soft with wonder. "I remember when there was talk of covering over the river entirely. Turning it into a parking lot or something equally practical and soulless."

"Progress," Robert said with a slight smile. "Though I'm glad someone had better sense. Margaret loved it here. We'd bring the kids every Christmas to see the lights."

He felt Silvia stiffen slightly beside him at the mention of his wife, and immediately regretted it. But she surprised him by stepping closer instead of pulling away.

"David proposed to me here," she offered quietly. "Right over there, actually, by that cypress tree. He'd hidden the ring in a basket of chips at the restaurant, but he was so nervous he forgot to tell me until we were halfway through our walk." A smile touched her lips. "I thought he was having a heart attack when he suddenly grabbed my hand and dragged me back."

They walked in silence for a moment, the only sounds the gentle lapping of water against stone and the distant laughter of other couples strolling the paths. A river barge glided past, its tour guide's amplified voice recounting the history of the Spanish missions.

"Does it feel wrong to you?" Robert asked suddenly. "To be here. With me. To feel..."

"Happy?" Silvia finished for him. She stopped walking and turned to face him, the lights catching the silver threads in her dark hair. "Terrified is more like it. I keep waiting for the guilt to crush me, and it does, in waves. But then you laugh at something I say, or you get that look on your face—the same one you had when you were seventeen and trying to explain why Hemingway was overrated—and I forget to feel guilty for a few minutes."

Robert's chest tightened. "What look?"

"Like you're trying to solve a puzzle. Like the world is this fascinating problem you can't quite figure out." She reached up, her fingers trembling slightly as they brushed a strand of gray hair from his forehead. "You still do it. After all these years."

He caught her hand before she could pull it away, cradling it between both of his. Her skin was soft, the bones more delicate than he remembered, but her grip was firm when she squeezed back.

"I thought about you," he said, the words tumbling out before he could stop them. "At my wedding. Margaret was walking down the aisle, and she was beautiful, and I loved her, I did, but for just a second I wondered—" He stopped, shaking his head. "God, what kind of person thinks about another woman on their wedding day?"

"The kind who had their heart broken," Silvia said gently. "The kind who never got closure." She looked down at their joined hands. "I thought about you too. When Miguel was born. David was holding him, and he had this expression of pure joy, and all I could think was that somewhere in the world, you might be doing the same thing. Holding your own baby. Building a life I'd never be part of."

"Sarah's first birthday," Robert admitted. "I was blowing up balloons, and Margaret asked me why I looked so sad. I told her I was just tired, but the truth was I'd been calculating. Wondering if you had kids. If they were the same age. If you were happy."

They started walking again, slower now, their shoulders touching. A guitarist sat on a bench ahead of them, his fingers moving over the strings in a melancholy melody that seemed to wrap around them like a shawl.

"Every anniversary," Silvia said. "Every single one, I'd think about that summer. About the river where we used to meet. About your terrible poetry."

Robert laughed, the sound surprising him. "It wasn't that terrible."

"It was absolutely terrible." Her eyes sparkled with affection. "But I loved it anyway. I kept them all, you know. Every single note you ever wrote me."

He stopped walking so abruptly that a couple behind them had to swerve to avoid a collision. "You kept them?"

"In a box in the back of my closet. David never knew." She looked away, toward the water. "I told myself it was just nostalgia. Teenage sentimentality. But I'd take them out sometimes, when things got hard, and I'd remember what it felt like to be that version of myself. The one who believed in grand gestures and impossible love."

"I burned mine," Robert said quietly. "The night before my wedding. I thought it would help me move forward. Be fair to Margaret." He paused. "But I couldn't burn the memories. Those stayed with me. Every time I drove past that old swimming hole. Every time I heard 'Brandy' on the radio. Every damn time someone ordered a strawberry milkshake."

Silvia's laugh was watery, and he realized she was crying. Not sobbing, just quiet tears that traced silver paths down her cheeks in the lamplight.

"We were so young," she whispered. "Too young to know what we had. Too young to fight for it properly."

"And now?" Robert asked, his heart hammering against his ribs. "Are we too old to be doing this? Two people in their sixties, chasing ghosts?"

She turned to face him fully, and the look in her eyes made his breath catch. It was the same look she'd given him that last night by the river, when they'd promised to love each other forever, when forever had seemed like something they could actually hold onto.

"I don't know what this is," she said. "I don't know if we're honoring something real or romanticizing a summer that ended forty-two years ago. I don't know if my children will ever understand. I don't know if I'm betraying David's memory or finally being honest with myself." She stepped closer, close enough that he could smell her perfume—something floral and complex, nothing like the Love's Baby Soft she'd worn at sixteen, but somehow essentially her. "But I know I want to find out."

Robert's hand moved of its own accord, cupping her cheek. She leaned into the touch, her eyes closing briefly.

"My daughter thinks I'm having a breakdown," he said. "She asked me yesterday if I'd considered therapy."

"Miguel thinks we're two lonely people clinging to each other because we're afraid of being alone." Silvia opened her eyes. "Maybe they're right."

"Maybe they are." Robert's thumb traced the curve of her cheekbone. "Or maybe we've been given something most people never get. A second chance."

"At what? We're not those kids anymore, Robert. We can't just run away together and pretend the last forty years didn't happen."

"I don't want to pretend they didn't happen." He let his hand fall but didn't step back. "Those years made us who we are. Our marriages, our children, our losses—they're all part of this. But that doesn't mean there isn't still something here. Something that never went away."

A cool breeze rippled across the water, carrying with it the scent of jasmine from the gardens above. Silvia wrapped her arms around herself, and Robert instinctively shrugged out of his jacket and draped it over her shoulders.

"You always did that," she said softly. "Gave me your jacket when I was cold."

"You never brought one, even when you knew you'd need it."

"I liked having an excuse to be close to you."

The admission hung between them, honest and raw. Robert felt something shift in his chest, like a door he'd kept locked for decades finally swinging open.

"Can I see you again?" he asked. "Not just once. Not just to satisfy our curiosity about what might have been. Really see you. Get to know who you are now, not just who you were."

Silvia was quiet for so long he thought she might say no. A barge passed by, its wake creating ripples that spread outward in ever-widening circles. Finally, she nodded.

"Yes," she

**Scene 4: Robert mentions to his daughte...**

**Scene 4: Robert mentions to his daughter Sarah over coffee that he's been seeing someone**

The afternoon sun slanted through Sarah's kitchen windows, casting geometric patterns across the granite countertops. Robert sat at the breakfast bar, his fingers wrapped around a coffee mug that bore the words "World's Best Mom" in fading letters. He'd given it to his daughter years ago, back when the grandkids were toddlers.

Sarah moved around the kitchen with practiced efficiency, loading the dishwasher from lunch. Her blonde hair—so much like Carol's—was pulled back in a ponytail, and she wore yoga pants and an oversized sweatshirt despite the Texas heat outside. The air conditioning hummed steadily, mixing with the clink of dishes and the distant sound of a lawnmower from somewhere down the cul-de-sac.

"The kids are getting so big," Robert said, trying to keep his tone light. "Jake must be what, almost five now?"

"Four and a half." Sarah didn't look up from the dishwasher. "He starts pre-K in the fall."

Robert took a sip of coffee, though it had gone lukewarm. His heart hammered against his ribs. He'd rehearsed this conversation a dozen times during the drive over, but now every carefully chosen word seemed to evaporate from his mind.

"Sarah, honey, I wanted to talk to you about something."

She closed the dishwasher and turned, leaning against the counter with her arms crossed. "What is it?"

"I've been... well, I've been seeing someone." The words came out rushed, tumbling over each other. "Just for coffee, dinner. Nothing serious yet, but—"

"Seeing someone?" Sarah's voice went sharp. "Like dating?"

"I suppose you could call it that, yes."

The color drained from Sarah's face, then rushed back in an angry flush. "Dad, Mom's been gone for four months. *Four months.*"

"I know how long it's been." Robert set down his mug, his hands suddenly unsteady. "Believe me, I know exactly how long it's been."

"Do you?" Sarah pushed off from the counter, her movements jerky with emotion. "Because it doesn't seem like you do. It doesn't seem like you're even thinking about her anymore."

"That's not fair—"

"Fair?" Her voice cracked. "You want to talk about fair? How is this fair to Mom? She spent thirty-eight years with you. She fought cancer for two years, and now you're just... what? Replacing her?"

"I'm not replacing anyone." Robert stood, needing to be on his feet, needing to make her understand. "Sarah, your mother was the love of my life. Nothing and no one could ever replace what we had."

"Then why?" Tears spilled down Sarah's cheeks. "Why are you doing this? Why can't you just..." She swiped at her face with the back of her hand. "God, Dad, we're still grieving. The kids still ask for Grandma. Tommy cried himself to sleep last week because he found one of her sweaters in the guest room closet."

The words hit Robert like physical blows. He thought of his grandson's small face, those wide eyes so innocent and confused by death's permanence.

"I'm grieving too," he said quietly. "Every single day."

"It doesn't look like it from where I'm standing." Sarah grabbed a dish towel and twisted it between her hands. "It looks like you couldn't wait to move on. Like Mom was just... disposable."

"Don't you dare say that." Robert's voice hardened. "Your mother was not disposable. She was everything to me. But she's gone, Sarah. She's gone, and I'm still here, and I'm so damn lonely I can barely breathe sometimes."

Sarah's jaw tightened. "So this is about you being lonely? That's what this is?"

"It's about me trying to figure out how to live again." Robert ran a hand through his thinning hair, frustration and hurt warring in his chest. "I didn't go looking for this. It just... happened."

"Who is she?"

Robert hesitated. "Someone I knew a long time ago. Before I met your mother."

"Oh my God." Sarah let out a bitter laugh. "An old girlfriend? You're seriously dating an old girlfriend while Mom's barely cold in the ground?"

"Sarah—"

"No." She held up a hand. "I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear about how you 'reconnected' or how it 'just happened.' Mom deserved better than this. We all deserve better than this."

The kitchen felt suffocating suddenly, the air too thick to breathe. Through the window, Robert could see the backyard swing set where he'd pushed his grandchildren just hours ago, their delighted shrieks still echoing in his memory.

"I loved your mother," he said, his voice rough with emotion. "I loved her with everything I had. But she's gone, and I have to find a way to keep living. Can't you understand that?"

"What I understand is that you're being selfish." Sarah's tears flowed freely now. "You're thinking about yourself and what you want, and you're not thinking about how this affects the rest of us. You're not thinking about what people will say, or how it makes Mom look, or—"

"What people will say?" Robert felt something snap inside him. "Since when do we care what people say?"

"Since my father started dishonoring my mother's memory by jumping into bed with the first woman who—"

"That's enough." Robert's voice came out harder than he intended. "You don't know what you're talking about."

They stared at each other across the kitchen island, the space between them suddenly vast and unbridgeable. Sarah's face was blotchy with tears, her eyes red-rimmed and accusing. Robert felt the weight of her judgment like stones in his chest.

"Maybe you should go," Sarah said finally, her voice small and broken.

"Sarah, please. Let's talk about this."

"I can't. I can't talk about this right now." She turned away from him, gripping the edge of the sink. Her shoulders shook with silent sobs. "Just go, Dad. Please."

Robert stood there for a long moment, wanting to reach for her, wanting to fix this somehow. But the rigid line of her back told him there would be no fixing it today.

"I'll call you," he said quietly.

She didn't respond.

Robert walked through the house on unsteady legs, past the family photos lining the hallway—his wedding day, Sarah's graduation, the grandkids' school pictures. Carol smiled out from a dozen frames, frozen in moments of joy that now felt impossibly distant.

The front door closed behind him with a soft click that sounded like a gavel falling.

In his truck, Robert sat with his hands on the steering wheel, not trusting himself to drive just yet. His phone buzzed in his pocket—a text from Silvia asking how his day was going. He stared at her name on the screen, at the simple kindness of that question, and felt guilt crash over him in waves.

Was Sarah right? Was he dishonoring Carol's memory? Was he being selfish?

The questions circled in his mind like vultures as he finally started the engine and pulled away from his daughter's perfect suburban home, leaving her tears and accusations behind but carrying the weight of them with him into the lengthening shadows of the afternoon.

**Scene 5: At a family dinner at Silvia's...**

# **Scene 5: At a family dinner at Silvia's...**

The aroma of *arroz con pollo* filled Silvia's dining room, but the warmth that usually accompanied Sunday dinner had turned cold. She moved the rice around her plate, her appetite gone as three pairs of eyes watched her from across the table.

Miguel set down his fork with deliberate precision. At thirty-four, he looked so much like his father that Silvia's heart clenched every time she saw him in profile. "So, Mom. Are we going to talk about it, or are we just going to pretend everything's normal?"

Rosa shot her older brother a warning look. "Miguel, not tonight."

"When, then?" Miguel leaned back in his chair, arms crossed. "It's been three weeks since Dad died, and she's already dating."

"I'm not—" Silvia started, then stopped herself. What was she doing, if not dating? The dinners with Robert, the long phone calls that stretched past midnight, the way her pulse quickened when his name appeared on her phone screen. "It's not like that."

"Then what is it like?" Miguel's voice held an edge she'd never heard directed at her before. "Because from where I'm sitting, it looks like you've moved on pretty damn fast."

Carlos, her youngest at twenty-eight, shifted uncomfortably in his seat. "Miguel, come on. Let her—"

"Let her what? Replace Dad with some guy she dated for one summer when she was a kid?" Miguel turned his attention fully to Silvia, and she saw tears glistening in his eyes. "Do you have any idea how this looks? How it feels?"

Silvia's hands trembled as she reached for her water glass. The ice had long since melted, leaving the water tepid and unsatisfying. "Your father and I had forty-two years together. Forty-two good years. Nothing and no one could replace that."

"Then why?" Rosa's voice was softer than her brother's, but the hurt in it cut deeper. "Why him? Why now?"

Because Robert made her feel like herself again—not just Javier's widow, not just someone's mother, but *Silvia*. Because when she looked at him, she remembered what it felt like to be young and full of possibility. Because in the devastating silence of her empty house, his voice on the phone was the only thing that made breathing feel less like drowning.

But how could she say any of that without sounding selfish?

"I know the timing looks bad," Silvia said carefully, choosing each word like stepping stones across a rushing river. "I know it seems fast. But Robert and I... we have history. We understand each other."

"History from forty-two years ago." Miguel's laugh was bitter. "Mom, that's not history. That's nostalgia. That's a fantasy you're both clinging to because you're lonely and scared."

The words hit their mark. Silvia felt her carefully constructed defenses crack. Wasn't that exactly what she'd been asking herself at three in the morning, when sleep wouldn't come? Whether she was falling for Robert or for the memory of who she'd been when she was with him?

"You don't know what you're talking about," she said, but her voice lacked conviction.

"Don't I?" Miguel leaned forward, his elbows on the table in a way she would have corrected when he was younger. "You spent one summer together as teenagers. One summer. And now, decades later, you both happen to be widowed at the same time, and suddenly it's fate? It's meant to be?"

"Miguel, that's enough." Carlos finally found his voice, though it wavered. "You're being cruel."

"I'm being honest." Miguel's gaze never left his mother's face. "Dad deserves better than this. His memory deserves better."

Silvia felt tears burning behind her eyes, but she refused to let them fall. "Your father would want me to be happy."

"Happy, yes. But desperate? Grasping at some idealized teenage romance because you can't handle being alone?" Miguel shook his head. "This isn't you, Mom. This is... I don't even know what this is."

Rosa reached across the table, her hand hovering near Silvia's but not quite touching. "We're just worried about you. What if you're building this up in your head? What if you're both just... projecting? Using each other as emotional crutches?"

The question hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. Silvia thought about Robert's laugh, the way his eyes crinkled at the corners. The way he'd reached for her hand across the table at the restaurant and how right it had felt. The way they'd talked for hours about everything and nothing, the conversation flowing as naturally as breathing.

But she also thought about the gaps—forty-two years of separate lives, of experiences they hadn't shared. Of the strangers they'd become to each other, despite the familiar comfort of their reunion.

"I don't know," she whispered, the admission costing her more than she'd expected. "I don't know what this is or where it's going. But I know that when I'm with him, I feel less broken. Is that so wrong?"

Miguel's expression softened slightly, but the concern remained. "And what happens when the novelty wears off? When you realize you're not actually the same people you were at eighteen? What then, Mom?"

Silvia had no answer. The doubt that had been a whisper in the back of her mind now roared to life, fed by her son's questions. Was she being foolish? Was she dishonoring Javier's memory by seeking comfort in another man's arms so soon?

The *arroz con pollo* had gone cold on everyone's plates. The dining room that had always been filled with laughter and warmth now felt like a courtroom, with Silvia in the defendant's chair.

"I think we should call it a night," Carlos said quietly, standing and beginning to clear the plates. "We're all still grieving. We're all saying things we might regret."

But Miguel wasn't finished. "Just promise me one thing, Mom. Promise me you'll really think about this. About whether what you're feeling is real or just... a convenient escape from the pain."

Silvia nodded, not trusting her voice. As her children filed out, each offering stiff hugs and murmured goodbyes, she remained at the table, surrounded by the remnants of a meal no one had eaten.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket. A text from Robert: *Thinking of you. Hope dinner with the kids went well.*

Her finger hovered over the screen, Miguel's words echoing in her mind. *Two lonely people romanticizing a teenage fling.* Was that all this was?

She typed and deleted three different responses before finally settling on: *We need to talk. Can you come over tomorrow?*

His reply came almost instantly: *Of course. Everything okay?*

Silvia looked around her empty dining room, at the chair where Javier used to sit, at the family photos lining the walls—forty-two years of memories staring back at her. She thought about the girl she'd been that summer in Mexico, and the woman she'd become, and the terrifying space between grief and hope where she now found herself suspended.

*I'm not sure,* she typed back. *I'm not sure about anything anymore.*

**Scene 6: Late that night, Robert calls ...**

**Scene 6: Late that night, Robert calls Silvia**

Robert sat on the edge of his bed, the house silent except for the distant hum of the refrigerator downstairs. The digital clock on his nightstand read 11:47 PM—too late for a phone call by most standards, but his thumb hovered over Silvia's name anyway.

Sarah had left hours ago, the door closing behind her with a finality that still echoed in his chest. He'd sat in the kitchen afterward, staring at Margaret's recipe box on the counter, waiting to feel the crushing guilt his daughter had accused him of lacking. But it hadn't come. Only a hollow ache and the certainty that he needed to hear Silvia's voice.

He pressed the call button.

She answered on the second ring, her voice soft and slightly breathless. "Robert. I was hoping you'd call."

"Did I wake you?"

"No. I'm on the back porch. Couldn't sleep." He heard the creak of her wicker chair, imagined her curled up in the darkness with the phone pressed to her ear. "Miguel was here for dinner."

Robert's chest tightened. "How did it go?"

A long pause, filled with the chirp of crickets from her end. "Not well. He thinks we're being ridiculous. Two old people playing pretend with a summer fling from another lifetime." Her voice wavered slightly. "He said his father deserves better than to be forgotten so quickly."

Robert closed his eyes. "Sarah said almost the same thing. That I'm dishonoring Margaret's memory. That it's only been ten months and I'm already—" He couldn't finish the sentence.

"Already what? Already feeling something?" Silvia's words carried an edge he'd never heard from her before. "Robert, I've spent the last three hours sitting out here asking myself if Miguel's right. If this is just... loneliness. Nostalgia. Two people who can't face being alone so they're clinging to some idealized memory of who they used to be."

The words hit him like a physical blow because he'd been asking himself the same questions. He stood and walked to the window, looking out at his darkened backyard where Margaret's rose bushes formed shadowy shapes against the fence.

"Is that what you think this is?" he asked quietly.

Another pause. Longer this time. When Silvia spoke again, her voice was steadier. "I don't know what this is, Robert. But I know how I felt when I saw you walk into that restaurant. I know that for the first time in two years, I didn't feel like I was just going through the motions of being alive." She took a shaky breath. "And that terrifies me. Because maybe they're right. Maybe we're being foolish."

Robert pressed his forehead against the cool glass of the window. "I loved Margaret. For thirty-eight years, I loved her. She was my partner, my best friend, the mother of my children." His throat tightened. "But Silvia, when I'm with you, I feel like myself again. Not the widower everyone tiptoes around. Not the father who can't seem to get anything right. Just... Robert."

He heard her breath catch.

"I've been thinking about something you said at dinner the other night," he continued. "About how you used to wonder what your life would have been like if things had been different between us. I did the same thing. Not constantly. Not in a way that took anything away from my marriage. But there were moments—birthdays, anniversaries, quiet Sunday mornings—when I'd remember that summer and wonder where you were. If you were happy. If you ever thought about me too."

"All the time," Silvia whispered. "I thought about you all the time."

The admission hung between them, heavy with implications.

"So what do we do?" Robert asked. "Do we walk away because it's easier? Because it's what our children expect? Because we're too old to be feeling like this?"

"Are we too old?" There was something almost defiant in her voice now. "Robert, I'm sixty years old. I spent forty-two years being the person everyone else needed me to be. A good daughter. A good wife. A good mother. And I don't regret any of it. But I'm tired of apologizing for wanting something for myself."

Robert felt something shift in his chest—a door opening that he'd been holding closed. "Sarah said I'm trying to replace her mother."

"Miguel said I'm disrespecting his father's memory."

"They don't understand."

"No," Silvia agreed. "They don't. And maybe they can't. Not yet. They're still grieving, and so are we. But Robert..." She paused, and he could picture her exactly as she'd looked across the table at the restaurant, her eyes bright with unshed tears and something that looked like hope. "I don't want to walk away from this. From you. Not again."

Robert's hand tightened on the phone. "Neither do I."

"Even if it means disappointing our children? Even if they think we're making a mistake?"

He thought about Sarah's tearful accusations, about the way she'd looked at him like he was a stranger. It hurt. But the thought of letting Silvia go again, of spending the rest of his life wondering what might have been—that hurt more.

"We owe them honesty and respect," he said slowly, working through the thought as he spoke. "But we don't owe them our happiness. Not at the expense of our own."

"Miguel said we're living in a fantasy," Silvia said. "That we've built up one summer into something it never was."

"Maybe we have. Maybe when we get to know each other as we are now—not as we were then—we'll realize this doesn't work." Robert moved away from the window and sat back down on the bed. "But I'd rather find that out than spend the rest of my life wondering. Wouldn't you?"

"Yes." The word came without hesitation. "God help me, yes."

A warm feeling spread through Robert's chest, loosening the knot of anxiety that had been there since Sarah's visit. "So we give this a real chance. We take it slow, we're honest with each other, and we deal with whatever comes."

"Together," Silvia added.

"Together."

He heard her exhale, could almost see her shoulders relaxing. "I should let you get some sleep. It's almost midnight."

"Wait." Robert wasn't ready to let her go yet. "What are you doing tomorrow?"

"Nothing that can't be rescheduled. Why?"

"There's a farmers market downtown on Sunday mornings. I used to go with Margaret." He paused, testing how the words felt. They didn't hurt as much as he'd expected. "Would you like to go with me? We could get breakfast, walk around, just... be together without worrying about our children or what anyone else thinks."

Silvia's smile was audible in her voice. "I'd love that."

"I'll pick you up at nine?"

"Nine is perfect."

They said their goodnights, but Robert held the phone for a long moment after she'd hung up, staring at her name on the screen. Outside his window, the first hints of dawn were beginning to lighten the eastern sky. In a few hours, the house would fill with the sounds of morning—the coffee maker gurgling, the newspaper hitting the driveway, the ordinary rhythms of another day.

But something had changed. For the first time since Margaret's death, Robert felt like he was moving toward something instead of just away from grief.

He set the phone on the nightstand and lay back against the pillows. Sleep would come eventually. And when it did, he knew he wouldn't dream of the past—not the distant past of that long-ago summer, nor the more recent past of hospital rooms and funeral arrangements.

He would dream of tomorrow.
