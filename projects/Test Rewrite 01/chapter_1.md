## Chapter 1: The Bear in the Garage

**Scene 1: Marcus wakes to the aftermath ...**

**Scene 1: Marcus wakes to the aftermath of a severe storm and discovers Bruno**

The storm had rearranged the world.

Marcus stood on the back porch in his too-short pajama pants, garbage bag dangling from one hand, staring at what used to be his backyard. Branches thick as his arm littered the grass like broken bones. The old oak tree near the fence had lost half its crown, leaving a jagged wound against the gray morning sky. Water pooled in the low spots, reflecting clouds that still looked bruised and angry.

His mom had shaken him awake twenty minutes ago—"Marcus, the trash, please, before I leave for work"—already dressed in her scrubs, already halfway out the door in her mind. He'd stumbled downstairs to find her gone, the coffee pot still warm, a Post-it note on the counter reminding him about leftover casserole for dinner.

The same as every morning. The same as the last six months.

Marcus picked his way across the soggy lawn, his sneakers squelching with each step. The air smelled like wet earth and torn leaves, that electric scent that lingered after lightning. A shingle from someone's roof had landed near the garden shed. He'd have to deal with that later.

The trash cans had blown over during the night—he could hear them banging around from his bedroom, competing with the thunder. They lay on their sides near the back fence, lids scattered, garbage spilling out onto the muddy ground. Great. He'd be picking up trash for an hour.

Marcus was reaching for the first can when he heard it.

A sound. Soft. Almost like a whimper.

He froze, hand extended, listening.

There it was again—a small, frightened noise coming from behind the overturned cans.

Probably a raccoon, he thought, taking a cautious step forward. Or a possum. Something that got trapped during the storm and was now cornered and scared, which meant dangerous. He should go back inside, let it find its own way out.

But something made him move closer.

"Hey," he said quietly, the way his dad used to talk to stray cats. "It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you."

He crouched down, peering into the gap between the fence and the trash cans.

Two dark eyes stared back at him.

Marcus's breath caught in his throat.

It wasn't a raccoon.

The cub was small—maybe the size of a cocker spaniel—with wet, matted fur the color of dark honey. It pressed itself against the fence, body trembling, making that soft whimpering sound again. One of its ears was torn, just slightly, and there was a scratch across its snout that looked fresh.

A bear cub. In his backyard. In suburban Riverside Heights, where the most exotic wildlife was usually Mrs. Chen's escaped parakeet.

Marcus didn't move. Couldn't move. His heart hammered against his ribs as his brain tried to catch up with what his eyes were seeing.

The cub whimpered again, and Marcus saw how its whole body shook—not just from fear, he realized, but from cold. The morning air was cool after the storm, and the cub was soaked through, probably had been out in the weather all night.

"Where's your mom?" Marcus whispered, even though he knew the cub couldn't answer. His eyes scanned the yard, half-expecting to see a massive adult bear come crashing through the fence. But there was nothing. Just the debris-strewn grass and the dripping trees and this tiny, terrified animal.

Slowly—so slowly—Marcus extended his hand.

The cub flinched, pressing harder against the fence, but it had nowhere to go. It was trapped by the overturned cans, by the fence, by whatever circumstances had brought it here in the middle of a storm.

"It's okay," Marcus heard himself say. "You're okay."

The cub's eyes never left his face. They were dark and wet and utterly terrified, and something in Marcus's chest twisted tight. He knew that look. He'd seen it in his own mirror often enough these past months—that expression of being lost and alone and not knowing what to do about it.

His hand was inches from the cub's nose now. He could see its nostrils flaring, could see the rapid rise and fall of its small chest.

"I'm not gonna hurt you," Marcus whispered. "I promise."

The cub made a sound—not quite a whimper, not quite a growl. More like a question.

Marcus held perfectly still, hand outstretched, barely breathing.

And then, so gently he almost didn't feel it, the cub's wet nose touched his fingertips.

**Scene 2: Marcus returns inside to find ...**

**Scene 2: Marcus returns inside to find his mother rushing to get ready for work**

Marcus slipped through the back door, his heart still hammering against his ribs. The kitchen smelled like burnt coffee and the vanilla air freshener his mother sprayed obsessively to mask it. He could hear her moving around in the living room, the familiar soundtrack of her morning routine—drawers opening, keys jangling, the weather report droning from the television.

He stood frozen by the door, his sneakers leaving muddy prints on the linoleum. Through the doorway, he could see her reflection in the hallway mirror as she struggled with an earring, phone wedged between her shoulder and ear.

"I know, I know. I'm leaving in five minutes," she was saying, her voice tight with stress. "The storm knocked out power at the east branch. They need me there to—yes, I understand that."

Marcus took a cautious step forward. His mother didn't turn around.

The television caught his attention. The local morning news filled the screen, and his stomach dropped when he saw the headline scrolling across the bottom: **ZOO OFFICIALS SEARCH FOR ESCAPED BEAR CUB**.

"—authorities are asking residents in the Riverside and Oakmont neighborhoods to check their yards and report any sightings," the news anchor was saying. Behind her, footage played of zoo workers in khaki uniforms spreading out across a residential street. Marcus recognized the street sign—they were only three blocks away.

His mother finally emerged from the hallway, jacket half-on, laptop bag sliding off her shoulder. She glanced at him, and for a moment, her eyes actually focused on his face.

"You're up early," she said, then immediately looked away, checking her watch. "Did the storm wake you? I heard trees coming down all night."

"Yeah, I—"

"I have to go. There's cereal in the cupboard." She was already moving toward the counter, gathering her things—phone, keys, the travel mug she'd forgotten to fill. "Mrs. Chen next door is home if you need anything. I'll try to be back by six, but with the power situation..."

She trailed off, distracted by something on her phone screen. Marcus stood there, acutely aware of the bear cub hiding less than fifty feet away. He should tell her. He knew he should tell her. The words were right there, crowding his throat.

*Mom, there's a bear in our garage.*

But she wasn't looking at him anymore. She never really looked at him anymore, not since Dad left for the oil rig job in Alaska. Eight months ago, he'd promised it would only be six months. Now the calls came less frequently, and when they did, Mom's voice went flat and careful, like she was talking to a stranger.

On the television, the news anchor continued: "The cub's mother died three weeks ago from complications during a routine procedure. Zoo officials say the young bear has been distressed and refusing food. They're concerned for his safety and are asking—"

Marcus's chest tightened. The cub's mother was dead. Bruno was alone, just like—

"Marcus? Are you listening?"

He blinked. His mother was staring at him now, one hand on the doorknob, impatience radiating from every line of her body.

"Stay inside today, okay? With that bear loose, I don't want you wandering around." She paused, seemed to actually see him for a second. "You look pale. Are you feeling alright?"

"I'm fine."

The moment stretched between them, fragile as spider silk. Then her phone buzzed, and just like that, she was gone—mentally first, then physically, the door closing behind her with a decisive click.

Marcus stood in the empty kitchen, listening to her car start in the driveway. The refrigerator hummed. The television continued its coverage of the search, now showing a photo of Bruno—his photo, Marcus realized, from before. The cub looked smaller on screen, more helpless.

His mind raced. They were searching the neighborhood. They'd find Bruno eventually. Someone would hear him, see him, call the authorities. And then what? Back to the zoo, back to a cage, alone and scared and—

No.

The decision crystallized in his chest, hard and certain and probably stupid. But it was *his* decision. For once, something was his to control, his to protect, his to keep.

Marcus moved quickly, quietly, pulling open the refrigerator. Milk—he grabbed the half-gallon, then thought better of it and poured some into a plastic container instead. His mother wouldn't notice. She never noticed what was missing, only what was in her way.

He found leftover chicken in a Tupperware, some cheese, an apple. He stuffed everything into his backpack, hands shaking slightly with adrenaline and something that felt dangerously close to purpose.

The television droned on behind him: "—asking anyone with information to call the zoo's emergency hotline—"

Marcus grabbed a bowl from the cupboard and headed for the back door. Through the window, he could see the garage, its side door slightly ajar where he'd left it. Inside, a frightened cub was waiting, needing him, depending on him.

For the first time in eight months, Marcus felt like he mattered.

He stepped outside, letting the door close softly behind him, sealing his secret inside the walls of his empty house.

**Scene 3: Marcus lures Bruno into the cl...**

**Scene 3: Marcus lures Bruno into the cluttered garage**

Marcus's hand trembled as he held out a slice of honey-glazed ham from last night's dinner. The cub's wet nose twitched, black eyes fixed on the offering with a mixture of hunger and fear.

"Come on," Marcus whispered, taking a slow step backward toward the garage. "It's okay. I promise."

Bruno—Marcus had already named him, though he wasn't sure when exactly the decision had been made—remained pressed against the fence, his matted fur making him look smaller than he probably was. Maybe forty pounds. Maybe less.

Marcus took another step back. The garage door yawned open behind him, its interior a cave of shadows and forgotten things. His mom kept threatening to clean it out, but between her double shifts at the hospital and her weekend administrative work, the threat remained empty. Now Marcus was grateful for her exhaustion.

The ham glistened in the morning light. Bruno's stomach made a sound like water going down a drain.

"That's it," Marcus said, moving backward again. His heel caught on the garage's threshold, but he steadied himself. "Just a little closer."

The cub moved. One paw, then another. His gait was uneven, favoring his left side. Marcus noticed a small cut above his front leg, crusted with dried blood and dirt. The knot in his chest tightened.

Three more steps and Bruno crossed into the garage.

Marcus tossed the ham deeper inside, near the old workbench his dad had built before he'd left for the oil rig job in Alaska. Six months ago, he'd said. Just six months. It had been eight.

Bruno lunged for the meat, and Marcus quickly pulled the garage door down, leaving it open just six inches to let in light and air. His heart hammered against his ribs as he fumbled for the pull-string light. The bulb flickered on, casting everything in harsh yellow.

The cub froze mid-chew, ham dangling from his mouth.

"Hey, hey, it's okay." Marcus dropped to his knees, making himself smaller. Less threatening. He'd read that somewhere once, maybe in one of those nature documentaries his dad used to watch. "You're safe here."

Bruno swallowed the ham and backed up until his hindquarters hit a stack of paint cans. The cans rattled but didn't fall. The cub's breathing came fast and shallow.

Marcus stayed still, letting Bruno adjust to the space. The garage smelled like motor oil, old cardboard, and something vaguely moldy that might have been the camping equipment shoved in the far corner. Dust motes swirled in the light, and somewhere in the rafters, something skittered. Probably mice.

After what felt like hours but was probably only two minutes, Marcus reached slowly into his hoodie pocket and pulled out another piece of ham. He placed it on the concrete floor between them and slid it forward.

Bruno's nose worked the air. His ears—rounded and almost comically small—swiveled forward.

"That's right," Marcus said softly. "I've got more. Lots more."

The cub crept forward, belly low to the ground. He snatched the ham and retreated, but not as far this time. Progress.

Marcus spent the next twenty minutes like this, creating a trail of food that led Bruno deeper into the garage, toward the back corner where his dad's old furniture sat covered in paint-stained tarps. A broken armchair. A coffee table with one short leg. Boxes of books his mom couldn't bear to donate.

It was perfect.

Working quickly while Bruno demolished the last piece of ham, Marcus rearranged the space. He dragged the armchair to create a barrier, stacked boxes to form walls, and spread out the tarp to make a floor. The result was a small cave-like area, hidden from view if someone opened the garage door. His mom never came in here anyway—too many memories of Dad, probably—but it felt safer this way.

From the utility shelf, he grabbed old beach towels, faded and frayed. He spread them in the makeshift den, creating something soft. Something that looked almost comfortable.

Bruno watched from beside the workbench, his body tense but his eyes curious.

"Look," Marcus said, sitting cross-legged near the entrance to the den. "It's for you. Your own space."

The cub didn't move.

Marcus pulled out his phone, fingers flying across the screen. *Bear cub care*. *What do bear cubs eat*. *How to help injured bear*.

The search results loaded, but one news article caught his eye first. His stomach dropped as he read the headline: "Zoo Cub Escapes During Storm—Mother Deceased, Officials Searching."

He clicked it.

*Bruno, a six-month-old black bear cub, escaped from the Riverside Zoo during last night's severe weather. The cub's mother, Bella, died two weeks ago from complications related to a chronic illness. Zoo officials believe the cub fled through a damaged section of fence and are asking residents to report any sightings. "Bruno is frightened and alone," said head zookeeper Patricia Mendez. "We need to find him before he gets hurt or hurts someone else."*

Marcus's vision blurred. He blinked hard, forcing the tears back.

Bruno's mother was dead. Just like that. Gone.

Marcus knew that feeling. Not death, exactly, but gone. His dad's voice on the phone every Sunday, growing more distant each week. The way his mom looked through him at breakfast, her mind already at the hospital. The empty chair at dinner. The silence that filled their house like water, drowning everything.

He looked at the cub, really looked at him. Bruno had curled into a tight ball beside the workbench, his fur still damp and dirty, his small body shaking.

"We're the same, you and me," Marcus whispered.

He grabbed another towel from the shelf, this one slightly cleaner, and approached slowly. Bruno's eyes tracked him but the cub didn't run. Progress.

"I'm going to clean you up a little, okay? That cut needs attention."

Marcus knelt beside Bruno and gently pressed the towel against the cub's fur. Bruno flinched but didn't pull away. The towel came away brown with mud and streaked with blood.

"Easy," Marcus murmured, working carefully around the cut on Bruno's leg. It wasn't deep, but it needed cleaning. He'd have to sneak some first-aid supplies from the bathroom.

As he worked, Bruno's breathing slowed. The shaking subsided. When Marcus moved the towel across the cub's back, Bruno made a sound—not quite a purr, but something close. A rumble of contentment.

Marcus's chest ached with something he couldn't name. When was the last time someone had needed him like this? When was the last time he'd mattered?

"You're going to be okay," he said, more to himself than to Bruno. "We both are."

He worked until Bruno's fur looked less like a disaster and more like actual fur—dark and surprisingly soft. The cub's eyes had started to droop, exhaustion finally overtaking fear.

Marcus guided Bruno toward the den he'd created, using gentle pressure and soft words. This time, the cub followed without resistance. Bruno stepped into the nest of towels, circled twice, and collapsed with a heavy sigh.

Marcus sat at the entrance, watching Bruno's breathing even out into sleep. His phone buzzed in his pocket—probably his mom, checking in from work—but he ignored it. Outside, he could hear sirens in the distance. Police or animal control, searching the neighborhood.

They wouldn't find Bruno. Marcus would make sure of it.

He reached out slowly and placed his hand on Bruno's side, feeling the rise and fall of the cub's breathing. Warmth spread through his palm, up his arm, settling somewhere in his chest where the loneliness usually lived.

"I've got you," Marcus whispered. "I won't let them take you."

Bruno's paw twitched in sleep, and Marcus wondered if bears dreamed. He hoped so. He hoped Bruno was dreaming of something better than chain-link fences and dead mothers and storms that tore the world apart.

His phone buzzed again. Reality pressing in.

But for now, in this dusty garage with its broken furniture and forgotten things, Marcus had found something that needed him. Something that looked at him and saw someone worth trusting.

He pulled his hand back reluctantly and stood, his knees cracking. He'd need to bring water. More food. Figure out how to keep Bruno quiet when his mom got home.

The problems were already piling up, a weight settling on his shoulders. But when he looked down at the sleeping cub, peaceful and safe in

**Scene 4: Over the next few days, Marcus...**

Over the next few days, Marcus became a thief.

Not a real thief, he told himself as he slipped three hot dogs from the refrigerator into his hoodie pocket. Just borrowing. Just taking care of something that needed him.

The garage had become his second bedroom. He'd cleared a space behind the old lawn mower and his dad's dusty workbench, piling cardboard boxes into a makeshift wall that hid Bruno from anyone who might peek inside. The cub had claimed a nest of blankets Marcus had pulled from the linen closet—his mom wouldn't notice, she never noticed anymore—and arranged them in a tire from his dad's old Mustang project, the one that had been gathering dust since before the divorce.

Bruno looked up as Marcus entered, his small black nose twitching. The fear from that first day had faded into something else: trust. The cub stumbled toward him on unsteady legs, making soft huffing sounds that Marcus had learned meant *hungry* and *happy* and *you're here*.

"I know, buddy. I know." Marcus unwrapped the hot dogs, tearing them into smaller pieces. Bruno's tongue was surprisingly rough against his palm as the cub ate. "Mom bought these for her lunches, so we gotta make them last, okay?"

The cub didn't answer, just kept eating with single-minded focus.

Marcus's phone buzzed in his back pocket. He ignored it. It had been buzzing all morning.

Another buzz. Then another.

With a sigh, he pulled it out. Seven texts from Jade, each one more insistent than the last.

*where are you???*

*marcus seriously*

*you've been weird for three days*

*are you sick? did something happen?*

*ANSWER ME*

*i'm calling*

*picking up would be cool*

As if on cue, his phone lit up with her name. Marcus stared at it, watching it vibrate in his hand. Bruno had finished the hot dogs and was now investigating Marcus's shoelaces with intense curiosity.

He let it go to voicemail.

Thirty seconds later, another text: *ok now i'm actually worried. if you don't answer by tonight i'm coming over*

Marcus's stomach twisted. He typed quickly: *sorry phone was dead. im fine just helping my mom with stuff around the house*

The lie came easier than it should have.

Three dots appeared immediately. Jade was typing. The dots disappeared. Reappeared. Finally: *you never help your mom with stuff around the house*

*new leaf* Marcus typed. *trying to be more responsible*

*...ok weirdo. want to come to the skate park tomorrow?*

Marcus looked at Bruno, who had given up on the shoelaces and was now attempting to climb into his lap. The cub was bigger than he'd been three days ago, Marcus was sure of it. His fur had lost some of its matted, muddy texture. His eyes were brighter.

*cant. lots of chores*

*you're being SO weird*

*sorry*

He pocketed the phone before she could respond and focused on Bruno, who had successfully made it onto his lap and was now gnawing on his thumb with teeth that were sharper than they looked.

"Ow, hey, no biting." Marcus gently extracted his thumb and offered the cub a knotted rope he'd found in the camping supplies instead. Bruno attacked it with enthusiasm.

That night, Marcus sat cross-legged on his bedroom floor with his laptop balanced on his knees, the glow of the screen the only light in the room. His mom had come home at nine, microwaved something, and gone straight to her bedroom. He'd heard her door click shut, heard the muffled sound of her TV through the wall.

She hadn't asked about his day. Hadn't noticed the missing hot dogs, or the half-empty gallon of milk, or the way the garage door now stayed locked from the inside.

He typed into the search bar: *what do baby bears eat*

The results were overwhelming. Formulas and feeding schedules and warnings about proper nutrition. He clicked through page after page, taking notes in the margins of his math homework. Bears needed protein. Fruits. Vegetables. Not human food, definitely not processed human food.

Marcus glanced at the kitchen, mentally cataloging what was in the refrigerator. Apples, maybe. Some sad-looking carrots in the vegetable drawer. Peanut butter?

Another search: *can bears eat peanut butter*

His phone buzzed. Jade again: *seriously tho are you ok? you're never this quiet*

Marcus chewed his lip. The cursor blinked in the search bar. Outside, wind rattled his window, and he thought of Bruno alone in the garage, curled up in his nest of blankets. Was he warm enough? Should Marcus have left more blankets? What if he cried and Mom heard?

*im fine i promise* he typed to Jade. *just tired. talk tomorrow?*

*you better*

He set the phone face-down and returned to his research, clicking through articles about bear development and habitat requirements and dietary needs. Each page made the knot in his stomach pull tighter. He was doing this all wrong. Bruno needed things Marcus couldn't give him. Space. Proper food. Other bears.

But then he thought of the news reports, the zoo officials with their tranquilizer guns and metal cages. He thought of Bruno's mother, dead. He thought of the way the cub had looked at him that first morning, terrified and alone.

Just like Marcus had felt the day his dad left.

"We need each other," Marcus whispered to the empty room. The words sounded hollow, but he repeated them anyway. "We need each other."

At midnight, he crept downstairs to the garage one more time. Just to check. Just to make sure.

Bruno was awake, sitting in his tire-nest with his head tilted, watching the door as if he'd been waiting. When he saw Marcus, his whole body wiggled with what could only be joy.

Marcus sat down beside him, and the cub immediately climbed into his lap, surprisingly heavy, smelling of earth and milk and something wild. Bruno's heartbeat thrummed against Marcus's chest, fast and alive and real.

"Tomorrow I'll get you apples," Marcus promised, stroking the soft fur between Bruno's ears. "And I'll figure out the rest. I will."

The cub yawned, showing pink gums and those sharp little teeth, then settled against Marcus's stomach with a contented sigh.

Outside, a siren wailed in the distance—police or ambulance, Marcus couldn't tell. He froze, holding his breath, but the sound faded away into the night. Just the city. Just normal sounds.

Nothing to worry about.

Marcus stayed there for another twenty minutes, until his legs went numb and Bruno's breathing deepened into sleep. When he finally laid the cub back in the blankets and stood to leave, his phone buzzed one more time.

Jade: *i know somethings up. you know you can tell me anything right?*

Marcus stared at the message for a long moment, his thumb hovering over the keyboard. Then he locked his phone without responding and slipped out of the garage, making sure the door was firmly locked behind him.

Some things, he thought as he climbed the stairs to his room, some things you couldn't tell anyone. Not even your best friend.

Especially not your best friend.

**Scene 5: Late one night, Bruno cries lo...**

**Scene 5: Late one night, Bruno cries loudly, and Marcus rushes to the garage in a panic**

Marcus jolted awake to a sound that turned his blood to ice.

The wail cut through the darkness—high-pitched, desperate, unmistakably not human. Bruno. Marcus threw off his blankets and lunged for his bedroom door, his heart hammering so hard he could feel it in his throat.

The crying grew louder.

*No, no, no, no, no.*

Marcus's bare feet slapped against the hardwood floor as he sprinted down the hallway. He didn't bother with stealth—speed was everything now. The stairs creaked under his weight as he took them two at a time, catching himself on the banister when he nearly lost his balance.

The door to the garage was in the kitchen. Marcus fumbled with the handle, his palms slick with sweat, and burst through into the cold darkness. The smell hit him immediately—the musty odor of old cardboard boxes mixed with the sharper scent of bear, earthy and wild.

"Bruno, shh, please, please shh," Marcus whispered frantically, dropping to his knees beside the nest of blankets.

The cub was sitting upright, his small body trembling, mouth open in another piercing cry. His eyes were squeezed shut, and even in the dim light filtering through the garage window, Marcus could see the wetness on his fur around his snout.

"Hey, hey, I'm here." Marcus scooped Bruno into his arms, pressing the cub against his chest. "I'm here, buddy. You're okay."

Bruno's claws dug into Marcus's t-shirt as another cry built in his throat. Marcus clamped his hand gently over the cub's muzzle—not enough to hurt, just enough to muffle the sound. Bruno squirmed, his small body surprisingly strong.

Then Marcus heard it.

The creak of floorboards directly above him.

His mother's bedroom.

Marcus froze, every muscle in his body locked tight. Bruno continued to whimper against his palm, but quieter now, the sound reduced to pitiful mewls. Marcus held his breath, listening so hard his ears rang.

Another creak. Then another. Footsteps moving across the ceiling toward the hallway.

*She's getting up.*

Marcus's mind raced. The garage door was unlocked—he'd been too panicked to think about locking it behind him. If she came down for water, if she decided to check on the noise, if she opened this door—

He pressed Bruno closer, rocking slightly, making the same soft shushing sounds he'd heard his father make when Marcus was little and couldn't sleep. The cub's breathing was hot and rapid against his palm. Marcus could feel the tiny heartbeat racing beneath the fur.

"Please," Marcus breathed, so quietly he barely heard himself. He wasn't sure if he was talking to Bruno or to whatever force controlled the universe. "Please."

The footsteps moved toward the stairs.

Marcus's own heart was beating so violently he thought it might give them away. He shifted deeper into the shadows behind the old filing cabinet, pulling Bruno with him. The blanket nest rustled. A glass jar on the nearby shelf wobbled.

*Don't come down. Please don't come down.*

The footsteps reached the top of the stairs. Paused.

Bruno whimpered again, softer this time, and Marcus felt the cub's tongue rasp against his palm. The small body was still shaking, but the fight was going out of him. Marcus kept rocking, kept whispering wordless comfort, his eyes locked on the thin line of light beneath the garage door.

A shadow passed across it.

Marcus stopped breathing entirely.

The shadow paused. Marcus could picture his mother on the other side, her hand on the doorknob, her head tilted as she listened. Had she heard? Was she about to turn the handle? What would he say? What could he possibly say that would make this okay?

Seconds stretched into eternities.

Then the shadow moved away. The footsteps retreated—not toward the stairs, but toward the bathroom. A door closed. Water ran through the pipes in the walls.

Marcus's breath came out in a shuddering gasp. His arms were trembling now too, and he realized he was shaking almost as badly as Bruno. The cub had quieted, making small snuffling sounds as he nuzzled against Marcus's chest, seeking warmth, seeking comfort, seeking his mother.

"I know," Marcus whispered, finally removing his hand from Bruno's muzzle. "I know, buddy. I miss mine too."

The water shut off. More footsteps. The bathroom door opened and closed. The creak of bedsprings as his mother climbed back into bed.

Then silence.

Marcus stayed frozen in the shadows for another five minutes, counting his heartbeats, waiting to be sure. Bruno had curled into a ball against his stomach, making the same soft grunting sounds he made when he was falling asleep. The cub's fur was damp where he'd been crying.

When Marcus finally moved, his legs had gone numb. He carefully arranged Bruno back in the blanket nest, tucking the edges around the small body. The cub's eyes were closed now, his breathing deep and even. One paw twitched in his sleep.

Marcus sat back on his heels, wiping his face with shaking hands. His t-shirt was stretched out and covered in cub fur. There were tiny puncture marks where Bruno's claws had gripped him.

This was only the third night.

The thought settled over him like a weight. Three nights, and he'd already almost been caught. How many more close calls could there be before his luck ran out? Before his mother heard, before Jade figured it out, before the zoo expanded their search?

Bruno sighed in his sleep, a sound so small and trusting it made Marcus's chest ache.

He reached out and gently stroked the cub's head, feeling the velvet softness of his ears. Bruno leaned into the touch without waking, seeking contact even in his dreams.

"I'll figure it out," Marcus whispered to the sleeping cub, to himself, to the darkness. "I promise. I'll figure it out."

But as he crept back toward the garage door, moving with exaggerated care across the concrete floor, Marcus couldn't shake the image of that shadow pausing beneath the door. Couldn't forget how close they'd come.

He paused with his hand on the doorknob, looking back at the small mound of blankets barely visible in the darkness. Tomorrow he'd have to be smarter. More careful. He'd need to find a way to keep Bruno quiet at night, to cover their tracks better, to stop Jade from asking questions he couldn't answer.

Tomorrow.

But tonight, all he could do was slip back into the house like a ghost, climb the stairs without making a sound, and lie awake in his bed, listening for any sign that his mother was still awake, still suspicious, still wondering what that sound had been.

The house remained quiet. But Marcus knew, with a certainty that sat heavy in his gut, that the quiet wouldn't last forever.

**Scene 6: Marcus sits in the garage watc...**

**Scene 6: Marcus sits in the garage watching Bruno sleep**

The garage smelled like motor oil and damp cardboard, with a new layer of something wild underneath—earth and fur and the faint sweetness of spilled milk. Marcus had cracked the side window open an inch, just enough to let in the evening air without making it obvious from outside that anything had changed.

Bruno was curled in the nest Marcus had built from his old camping blankets and a sleeping bag his dad had left behind. The cub's breathing came slow and steady now, his small chest rising and falling beneath the brown fur that was still matted in places from the storm. One paw twitched, and Marcus wondered what bears dreamed about.

He shifted his weight on the overturned milk crate he'd dragged over to sit on, his back against the workbench where his dad's tools still hung in neat rows. The garage felt different now—not just the forgotten storage space where broken things went to wait. It felt alive. Important.

Marcus pulled out his phone and scrolled through the notes he'd taken. *Bear cubs nurse 5-6 times daily. Omnivores but need protein. Can't digest cow's milk well—goat milk better.* He'd have to figure that out tomorrow. The kitchen was already missing half a carton of milk and most of the lunch meat. His mom hadn't noticed yet, but she would.

His phone buzzed. Jade again.

*seriously where were you after school? you NEVER skip our wednesday walk home*

Marcus's thumbs hovered over the keyboard. He could see her face in his mind—eyebrows raised, that look she got when she knew he was hiding something. They'd been best friends since fourth grade, when she'd moved in three houses down and declared that his comic book collection was "acceptable but needed more diverse titles." She could read him like one of those comics.

*had stuff to do. all good*

Three dots appeared immediately, then disappeared. Then appeared again. Finally:

*you're being weird*

*im fine*

*that's what people say when they're not fine*

He turned the phone face-down on his knee.

Bruno made a small sound, somewhere between a whimper and a sigh, and shifted in the blankets. Marcus froze, but the cub didn't wake. In the dim light from the single bulb overhead, Bruno looked smaller than he had this morning. Fragile. The news had said his mother died three weeks ago. Some kind of infection. They'd been trying to bottle-feed him, but he wasn't adjusting well to captivity.

*Wasn't adjusting well.* That's what the zoo spokesperson had said, her voice professionally sympathetic. Like Bruno was a broken appliance that wouldn't work right.

Marcus knew what that felt like.

His phone buzzed again, but it wasn't Jade this time. It was a news alert: *Zoo officials expand search for missing bear cub. "We're concerned for his safety," says director. "He's vulnerable without his mother."*

The knot in Marcus's stomach tightened. He should call them. He knew that. There was probably a reward, and definitely people who actually knew what they were doing. People with the right food and medicine and whatever else a bear cub needed.

But then Bruno's eyes opened—just a crack—and found Marcus in the shadows. The cub made a soft huffing sound, not scared, just checking. Making sure he wasn't alone. Then his eyes drifted closed again, and his breathing deepened back into sleep.

Marcus felt something crack open in his chest, warm and terrifying.

When was the last time anyone had looked for him like that? His mom was working a double shift tonight—again. His dad called every Sunday from the oil fields in Alaska, their conversations awkward and full of long pauses. "How's school?" "Fine." "Your mom doing okay?" "Yeah." "Well, I should let you go."

Nobody *needed* him. Not really. Not the way Bruno did.

Marcus stood slowly, his legs stiff from sitting. He moved closer to the nest and crouched down, careful not to wake the cub. Bruno's fur was getting fluffier as it dried, standing up in little tufts around his ears. One of those ears had a small notch in it—maybe from birth, maybe from something else.

"I know this is crazy," Marcus whispered. "I know I don't know what I'm doing."

Bruno's paw twitched again.

"But I'm not going to let them put you in a cage. You've been through enough."

The words sounded braver than he felt. His phone buzzed one more time—his mom, texting that she'd be home by midnight, there was leftover pizza in the fridge. Marcus typed back a quick response, then opened his notes app again.

*Day 1—Bruno ate, drank water, sleeping. Seems less scared. Need to get better food. Need to keep him quiet at night. Need to figure out how long before someone notices.*

He stared at that last line. How long *could* this last? A week? A few days? The rational part of his brain—the part that sounded like Jade—knew this was temporary at best, disaster at worst.

But the other part, the part that had felt hollow for months, was already planning tomorrow. What he'd feed Bruno for breakfast. How he'd sneak out here before school. Whether he could find a way to make the garage warmer without his mom noticing the electric bill spike.

Marcus reached out and gently touched the top of Bruno's head, just for a second. The fur was impossibly soft.

"We need each other," he said quietly. "That's enough for now."

He stood and walked to the garage door, his hand on the light switch. Bruno was a dark shape in his nest of blankets, peaceful and safe and trusting in a way that made Marcus's throat tight.

Tomorrow would be complicated. Tomorrow would bring new problems, new lies, new risks. But tomorrow was tomorrow.

Tonight, for the first time in a long time, Marcus wasn't alone.

He flicked off the light and slipped through the door into the house, the knot in his stomach still there but somehow easier to carry. Behind him, in the darkness, a small bear cub dreamed of things Marcus couldn't know, while outside the window, the neighborhood settled into its ordinary evening—completely unaware that everything had changed.
