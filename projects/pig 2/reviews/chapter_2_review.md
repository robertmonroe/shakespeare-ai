## Chapter 2 Review:

1. **Internal Consistency**
    * Issue: Scene 2 states Johnny’s parents have overheard noises and that his apartment smells like a county fair, and that his parents saw straw under the door in Scene 4. In Scene 6, Johnny's parents enter the bathroom claiming they heard noises and water but didn’t smell the barn-like odor or suspect Arnie.
    * Issue: In Scene 5, the water dripping through the ceiling should alert his parents to the origin of the barnyard smell coming from the bathroom (pig waste) and be combined with their knowledge from Scene 4.

2. **Clarity**
    * No issues found.

3. **Plot Holes**
    * Issue: Why is Johnny using lavender shampoo on a pig? He is trying to be secretive and efficient. Wouldn't he hide the fact he's using shampoo at all?

4. **Redundancy**
    * Issue: The constant repetition of Johnny thinking "This is harder than I thought" and variations thereof is redundant. It's stated at the end of Scene 1, and then several more times throughout the rest of the chapter.
    * Issue: In Scenes 3, 4, 5, and 6 the text continually repeats the parent's rising suspicions.

5. **Flow and Transitions**
    * Issue: The transition between Scenes 2 and 3 is abrupt. Consider a line break or sentence about the passing of time to indicate the scene shift.

6. **Actionable Fixes**

1.  In Scene 2, paragraph 1, change "It's dinner time. Johnny nervo..." to "Later that evening, at dinner time, Johnny nervo..." to ease the transition from Scene 1 to Scene 2.
2.  Remove: End of Scene 1 "This was going to be harder than he thought."
3.  In Scene 4, combine the details from this scene into Scene 5, as it would be far more logical for the parents to catch Johnny and Arnie bathing in the bathroom.
4.  Delete Scene 3.
5.  Delete Scene 4.
6.  Combine the events of Scenes 4 and 5 and let the "barn smell" and the water dripping through the neighbor's ceiling be the reason Johnny's parents come barging in on him bathing Arnie.
7.  In the newly combined Scene 5, ensure the parents' dialogue reflects awareness of the "county fair" smell and suspicion of Johnny.
8.  Delete "…beatboxing excuse.” From the text “Sorry for all the noise, buddy. And for the… beatboxing excuse. I promise, I'll find a better way. I just… I don't know how much longer I can keep you hidden.”
9.  In Scene 5, replace “He squirted a dollop of his mom’s lavender-scented shampoo onto Arnie’s back.” With "He grabbed the first bottle he could find and squirted it onto Arnie's back."
10. Remove: Redundant mention of "This is going to be harder than I thought" from the end of Scene 2.
11. Remove: Redundant mention of concerns that he can't keep Arnie hidden for much longer from Scene 6.
