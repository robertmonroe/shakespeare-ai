# Chapter 3: Honoring the Past, Embracing the Future

## Chapter 3: Honoring the Past, Embracing the Future

**Nearly a year after their reconnection**

The afternoon sun slanted through the café windows, casting amber light across the worn wooden tables. Robert arrived early, as he always did when meeting Silvia, unable to help himself. He chose their usual corner booth—the one with the faded vinyl seats and a view of the street where pecan trees shed their leaves in gentle spirals.

He ordered two coffees, hers with cinnamon and a touch of cream, and watched the door.

When Silvia entered, his heart still performed that same foolish leap it had at seventeen. Nearly a year of occasional meetings, phone calls that stretched into the evening, afternoons walking through the park—and still, every time he saw her, the world shifted into sharper focus.

She wore a burgundy sweater that complemented her silver-streaked dark hair, now loose around her shoulders. But something in her movements made him sit straighter. The way she clutched her purse. The deliberate breath she took before crossing to him.

"Hi." She slid into the booth, her smile bright but tremulous.

"You're nervous." He reached across the table, and she immediately laced her fingers through his.

"Is it that obvious?"

"Only to someone who's been studying you for forty-three years." The words came easier now, the acknowledgment of all that lost time no longer a wound but a simple fact. "What's wrong?"

Silvia wrapped her free hand around the coffee cup he'd ordered for her, inhaling the cinnamon steam. Outside, a gust of wind sent a cascade of leaves tumbling past the window. Late October in Texas—the air finally crisp enough to hint at autumn, the days shortening toward the holidays.

Toward Día de los Muertos.

"Nothing's wrong," she said quietly. "I just... I have something to ask you, and I'm not sure how you'll feel about it."

Robert waited, his thumb tracing circles on her wrist. He'd learned patience this year. Learned to let silence breathe between them, to trust that she would find her words.

"It's almost November first," she continued, her eyes fixed on their joined hands. "My family—we've celebrated Día de los Muertos together for as long as I can remember. Since the kids were small. Since..." She paused, and he heard the name she didn't say. *Eduardo.*

"I know." He'd listened to her stories about the tradition. The ofrenda she built each year with photographs and marigolds, pan de muerto and Eduardo's favorite whiskey. The way her daughters and grandchildren gathered to remember, to honor, to keep the connection alive.

"This year, I want you there." The words tumbled out quickly, and she finally met his eyes. "With me. With my family. I want to introduce you properly, not as an old friend but as... as what you are to me."

Robert's chest tightened. He understood what she was offering—what she was asking. In the past year, they'd been careful. Discreet. Meeting mostly alone, telling their children they were "reconnecting" in vague terms that allowed everyone to maintain comfortable distance. His daughters knew he was spending time with someone. Her daughters knew she'd reconnected with a high school friend. They'd been seen together around town—at the grocery store, the park, the library—but always in that undefined space between friendship and something more.

But this was different. This was standing together in front of her entire family during their most sacred gathering. This was claiming each other publicly, permanently. This was acknowledging that honoring those who had passed didn't preclude building something new with those still living.

"Silvia." His voice came out rougher than intended. "Are you sure? Your daughters—"

"Need to see that I'm still living." She squeezed his hand. "That I'm allowed to still be living. And so do your daughters."

"They'll be there?"

"I'd like them to be. If you think... if you think they'd come." Her nervousness bloomed into something more vulnerable. "Robert, I'm not asking you to forget Margaret. God, I would never—"

"I know that."

"And I'm not replacing Eduardo. I couldn't. I don't want to."

"I know that too."

She took a shaky breath. "But I can't keep living in the margins of my own life. We can't. This past year has been wonderful, but it's also been... incomplete. Like we're teenagers sneaking around again, worried about what people will think."

Robert smiled despite the gravity of the moment. "We were terrible at sneaking around."

"The worst." A laugh escaped her, brief and bright. "Your mother knew immediately."

"So did yours."

The shared memory hung between them—two seventeen-year-olds convinced they were being subtle, while their mothers watched with knowing eyes and worried hearts. Different worlds, their parents had said. Different futures.

And they'd been right, in a way. He and Silvia had built different lives, loved different people, created different families. But sitting here now, her hand warm in his, Robert understood that those parallel paths had been leading somewhere all along.

"When is it?" he asked.

"November first. The celebration starts at sunset." She searched his face. "You don't have to answer now. I know it's a lot to ask. Meeting everyone, being part of something so personal—"

"Yes."

Silvia blinked. "Yes?"

"Yes, I'll be there. Yes, I want to meet your family properly. Yes to all of it." He brought her hand to his lips, kissed her knuckles gently. "And I'll ask my daughters to come too. It's time they understood."

"Understood what?"

"That their father is in love." The declaration settled over them like the autumn light—golden, inevitable, right. "That he's been given an extraordinary gift, and he's not fool enough to refuse it."

Tears brightened Silvia's eyes. "You're sure?"

"I've never been more sure of anything." He paused, letting himself feel the truth of it. "Margaret would want this for me. She told me, near the end, that she didn't want me to be alone forever. I didn't believe I'd ever want anything else, but..." He gestured between them, encompassing everything they'd become. "Look at us now."

"Look at us now," Silvia echoed softly.

They sat in comfortable silence, drinking their coffee as the café hummed with afternoon life around them. Someone's phone played mariachi music. The espresso machine hissed and gurgled. Outside, more leaves spiraled down, preparing the world for winter.

"I'm scared," Silvia admitted finally.

"Me too."

"What if they hate it? What if bringing you into something so sacred feels wrong to them?"

Robert considered this, weighing his words carefully. "Then we'll show them it's not. We'll show them that the Day of the Dead isn't just about looking backward—it's about the connection between past and present, memory and life."

"You make it sound simple."

"It's not simple at all. It's probably going to be messy and complicated and uncomfortable." He smiled. "But so is everything worth doing."

Silvia laughed, the sound breaking through her anxiety. "When did you become so wise?"

"About five minutes ago. I'm making it up as I go."

She leaned across the table, and he met her halfway, their foreheads touching. This close, he could see the fine lines around her eyes, the silver threading through her hair, all the beautiful evidence of the years they'd lived apart. Years that had shaped them, broken them, taught them what mattered.

"Thank you," she whispered.

"For what?"

"For saying yes. For understanding. For being patient with all my fears."

"Silvia." He cupped her face gently. "You've been patient with mine too."

She kissed him then, soft and sweet, tasting of cinnamon and promise. When they pulled apart, her smile was steadier.

"November first," she said. "Sunset."

"I'll be there."

"And your daughters?"

"I'll talk to them this week." He felt a flutter of his own nervousness. "They deserve to know the whole truth. About us. About what we mean to each other."

Silvia nodded, understanding the weight of that conversation. They'd both been protecting their children this year, moving slowly, giving everyone time to adjust. But time had a way of running out if you didn't claim it.

"One week," she said, as much to herself as to him.

"One week until we stop hiding."

"Or until everything finally becomes what it was meant to be."

Robert smiled, thinking of the ofrenda she would build, the candles that would guide the spirits home, the marigold petals that would carpet the ground in gold. He thought of standing beside her among her family, and felt ready.

**Robert meets with his adult children to tell them about Silvia's invitation**

Five days later, Robert's fingers trembled slightly as he adjusted the photograph on the mantel—Margaret in her garden, laughing at something beyond the frame's edge. Sunlight streamed through the living room windows, illuminating the dust motes that danced above the coffee table where he'd set out cups and a fresh pot of coffee. The familiar ritual of preparing for his children's visit usually brought comfort, but today his stomach churned with an anxiety he hadn't felt in years.

The drive home from the café had given him time to think, to rehearse what he needed to say. But the words felt inadequate, too small to contain the enormity of what he was asking his daughters to accept.

The doorbell rang at precisely two o'clock. His daughter Sarah had inherited her mother's punctuality.

"Hi, Dad." Sarah kissed his cheek, her eyes already scanning the room with that assessing look she'd perfected as a hospital administrator. Behind her, his younger daughter Emily followed, pulling off her jacket.

"Sorry I'm late," Emily said, though she wasn't. "Traffic on I-35 was a nightmare."

Robert gestured toward the sofa. "Coffee's ready. I made those cookies you like, Sarah. The lemon ones."

"You baked?" Sarah's eyebrows rose as she settled into her usual spot—the right corner of the couch where she'd sat for family meetings since she was sixteen. "This must be serious."

Emily poured coffee for the three of them, the clink of ceramic against the pot unnaturally loud in the quiet room. Robert noticed how his younger daughter's gaze lingered on the photographs lining the built-in shelves—the visual history of their family frozen in silver frames.

"So," Emily said, settling beside her sister. "What's going on? Your text said it was important."

Robert lowered himself into his recliner, the leather creaking beneath him. He'd rehearsed this conversation a dozen times in his head, but now the carefully chosen words evaporated like morning fog.

"I've been invited to a Día de los Muertos celebration," he began. "By Silvia. To meet her family."

The silence that followed felt thick enough to touch.

Sarah set her coffee cup down with deliberate care. "The woman from high school."

"Yes."

"The one you've been seeing for—how long now?" Her tone was measured, controlled. Too controlled.

"Almost a year." Robert met his daughter's eyes. "I know I haven't talked about it much, but I need to tell you both that I'm serious about her. About us."

Emily leaned forward, her expression more open than her sister's. "Dad, we're not teenagers. You don't need our permission to date."

"No, but I need you to understand." Robert's throat tightened. "This isn't just casual anymore. This is—" He paused, searching for the right words. "This is something real. Something I want you both to be part of."

Sarah's expression shifted, something tightening around her eyes. She stood, but didn't move away from the couch—just needed to be on her feet, her hands flexing at her sides. "How serious are we talking?"

"Serious enough that I want you to meet her family. Serious enough that I'm asking you to come with me to this celebration." Robert held her gaze. "Serious enough that I need you to know I'm in love with her."

The words hung in the air. Emily's eyes widened slightly, but Sarah's face went carefully blank—the expression she wore when processing difficult news at the hospital.

"It's only been three years, Dad," Sarah said finally, her voice tight.

"I know."

"Three years since Mom died." Her voice cracked on the last word, and suddenly she was moving, crossing to the mantel where Margaret's photograph presided over the room. She picked it up, her fingers tracing the frame's edge. "And now you're ready to just... what? Replace her?"

"Sarah—" Emily started, but Robert raised his hand.

"Let her speak."

Sarah turned, tears glistening in her eyes. "We still have her clothes in your closet. Her books are still on the nightstand. Her coffee mug is still in the cabinet where she left it. And you're telling us you're ready to move on? To bring another woman into the life you built with Mom?"

The accusation hung in the air between them. Robert felt the weight of it settle on his chest, but beneath the pain, he recognized the truth he'd been avoiding.

"Come sit down, sweetheart. Please."

Sarah returned to the couch reluctantly, sinking down beside Emily, who reached for her hand.

Robert leaned forward, his weathered hands clasped between his knees. "Your mother and I had forty-two years together. Forty-two beautiful, complicated, sometimes difficult, always worthwhile years. I loved her with everything I had." He paused, his voice thickening. "And I miss her. Every single day, I miss her."

"Then how can you—" Sarah began.

"Because she's not coming back." The words emerged more harshly than he'd intended. Robert softened his tone. "She's not coming back, and I have to decide whether I'm going to spend whatever years I have left just... existing. Going through the motions. Or whether I'm going to actually live."

Emily's jaw tightened. "Is that what you think you've been doing? Just existing?"

"Haven't I?" Robert looked at his younger daughter. "When was the last time I did something that wasn't part of the routine your mother and I established? When was the last time I seemed genuinely happy?"

"You seemed happy at Christmas," Sarah countered. "At Emily's gallery opening. At—"

"Those were moments of happiness," Robert interrupted gently. "Brief sparks. But the rest of the time?" He shook his head. "I was maintaining. Preserving. Existing in the house we built together, surrounded by memories, afraid that if I changed anything, I'd lose her all over again."

The afternoon light had shifted, casting long shadows across the room. A car passed outside, its radio briefly audible before fading into the distance.

"Tell us about her," Emily said quietly. "About Silvia."

Robert felt something loosen in his chest. "She understands loss. Her husband died five years ago—cancer. She knows what it's like to build a life with someone and then have to figure out who you are when they're gone." He smiled, remembering. "She's funny. Sharp. She doesn't let me get away with anything. And when I'm with her, I feel like myself again. Not just your father, or Margaret's widower, but... Robert."

"You're always Robert, Dad," Sarah said softly.

"Am I?" He met her gaze. "Or have I been playing the part of the man I used to be?"

Sarah wiped her eyes with the back of her hand. "I just don't want you to forget Mom."

"Never." Robert's voice broke. "I could never forget her. But I'm starting to understand something your mother tried to tell me when she was sick." He paused, steadying himself. "Do you remember what she said? Right near the end?"

Emily nodded slowly. "She told you not to stop living."

"She made me promise." Robert's eyes burned with unshed tears. "She said, 'Robert, you have too much love in you to spend the rest of your life alone. Don't let grief turn you into a ghost.' I promised her. And then I spent three years breaking that promise because I felt guilty. Because I thought moving forward meant leaving her behind."

Sarah rose and crossed to her father, kneeling beside his chair. "Dad, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel—"

"You didn't." He cupped her face in his hands, the way he had when she was small. "You're protecting your mother's memory. That's what a good daughter does. But sweetheart, I need you to understand something." He waited until she met his eyes. "What I feel for Silvia doesn't diminish what I had with your mother. It's a different kind of love—one built on shared loss and second chances rather than youth and discovery."

Emily joined them, standing behind her sister with her hand on Sarah's shoulder. "What do you need from us, Dad?"

"I need you to give her a chance," Robert said. "I need you to understand that when I go to this celebration, when I stand with Silvia and her family, I'm not betraying your mother. I'm honoring her. I'm keeping the promise I made to her."

Sarah leaned her head against her father's knee, a gesture from childhood. "Is she good to you?"

"Very good."

"Does she make you happy?"

"She does."

A long moment passed. Finally, Sarah lifted her head. "Then I want to meet her. Properly, I mean. Not just..." She hesitated, then continued, "I saw you two together. About three months ago, at the grocery store. You were in the produce section, arguing about avocados." 

Robert blinked. "You saw us?"

"You were laughing. Really laughing. I almost came over, but..." She shrugged. "I wasn't ready. I told myself it was probably just a casual friendship thing, that you were just getting out of the house. But I knew, Dad. I think part of me knew it was more than that."

"Why didn't you say anything?" Emily asked her sister.

"Because I was scared," Sarah admitted. "Scared of what it meant. Scared it would make Mom's absence more real somehow." She looked at her father. "But now I think maybe Mom was right. You do have too much love in you to spend it all on memories."

Emily squeezed her father's shoulder. "When is this celebration?"

"November first. Next week." Robert looked between his daughters. "Silvia would like you both to come. To meet her family. I know it's asking a lot—"

"We'll be there," Emily said firmly, glancing at Sarah, who nodded.

"Both of us," Sarah confirmed. "If you're serious about her, we should know her. And she should know us."

Robert felt tears prick his eyes. "Thank you. Both of you."

"But Dad?" Sarah stood, helping him to his feet. "You need to do something for us too."

"Anything."

"Start going through Mom's things. Not everything—keep what matters. But you can't move forward if you're living in a museum." Her voice was gentle but firm. "Mom wouldn't want that."

Robert nodded, knowing she was right. "I will. I promise."

Emily hugged him tightly. "We love you, Dad. We just want you to be happy."

"I know, sweetheart. I know."

As his daughters prepared to leave, Sarah paused at the door. "What should we bring? To the celebration?"

"Silvia mentioned bringing flowers—marigolds, if you can find them. And maybe some pan dulce from the Mexican bakery on Guadalupe Street."

"We'll find it," Emily promised.

After they left, Robert returned to the mantel and picked up Margaret's photograph. "Thank you," he whispered to her smiling face. "For understanding. For setting me free."

The afternoon sun caught the glass, making it seem for just a moment as though Margaret winked at him. Robert smiled and carefully set the photo back in its place. Then he walked to the bedroom and opened the closet, looking at the clothes that had hung untouched for three years.

Tomorrow, he thought. Tomorrow he would start.

**Silvia prepares for Día de los Muertos with her daughters**

The next afternoon, the scent of marigolds filled Silvia's living room, their bright orange petals scattered across the dining table like captured sunlight. Silvia smoothed the embroidered cloth over the ofrenda table—the same cloth her mother had used, its edges worn soft by decades of devotion.

"Mamá, where do you want Papá's photo?" Carmen held the silver frame carefully, her father's smile frozen in time from their twenty-fifth anniversary. The photo showed him in his favorite guayabera, the one Silvia had pressed and folded away in tissue paper upstairs.

"Center, mija. Like always." Silvia's voice caught slightly, but she kept her hands steady as she arranged the votive candles.

Lucia emerged from the kitchen carrying a plate of pan dulce, the sweet bread perfectly golden. "I used Papá's recipe. Well, I tried. Mine never rises quite like his did."

"He would have loved them anyway," Silvia said, taking the plate and placing it on the ofrenda beside a bottle of his favorite tequila and the reading glasses he'd worn while doing crossword puzzles every Sunday morning.

Her youngest, Elena, knelt by a box of decorations, pulling out papel picado banners. "Should we hang these the same way as last year?"

"However you think looks beautiful, corazón."

As her daughters worked, Silvia found herself standing before the growing ofrenda, her fingers tracing the edge of Eduardo's photograph. Twenty-eight years of marriage. Three beautiful daughters. A lifetime of Sunday breakfasts and shared laughter and quiet evenings on the porch.

"Mamá?" Carmen's voice was gentle. "Are you okay?"

Silvia turned to find all three of her daughters watching her with concern etched on their faces. She took a breath, knowing this moment had been building for weeks.

"I need to tell you something," she said, gesturing for them to sit. "About Robert."

The name hung in the air like incense smoke. Elena and Lucia exchanged glances, but Carmen's expression remained neutral, waiting.

"I loved your father," Silvia began, her voice firm. "I loved him with everything I had. He gave me you three, and a life I was proud of, and memories that will stay with me until I take my last breath." She paused, looking at each of her daughters. "But I also care deeply for Robert. And I've invited him to join us tomorrow night."

"To Día de los Muertos?" Lucia's eyes widened. "Mamá, that's—"

"I know what it means," Silvia said quietly. "I know what I'm asking. But I need you to understand something." She moved to the ofrenda, straightening a marigold petal. "Your father and I talked about this once, years ago, after his diagnosis. He made me promise that if something happened to him, I wouldn't close myself off from living."

Carmen set down the candle she'd been holding. "He said that?"

"He did. At the time, I couldn't imagine it. How could I even think about anyone else?" Silvia picked up the photo of Eduardo, cradling it in both hands. "But then Robert came back into my life, and I understood what your father meant."

Elena stood and moved to her mother's side. "Do you think Papá would have liked him?"

Silvia smiled through the tears gathering in her eyes. "I think your father would have appreciated that Robert makes me laugh again. That he listens when I talk and doesn't try to fix everything. That he's patient with my stubbornness."

"He's invited to the celebration tomorrow, isn't he?" Carmen asked quietly. "That's why you're telling us now."

"Yes. And his daughters are coming too." Silvia set Eduardo's photo back on the ofrenda with reverent care. "If that's okay with you girls. I wouldn't bring him into something so sacred if I didn't believe your father would approve."

Lucia moved closer, her voice uncertain. "What if it feels wrong? What if having him here, on this night, feels like we're—"

"Betraying your father?" Silvia finished gently. "I've worried about that too. But then I remember what he told me in those last weeks. He said, 'Silvia, love isn't a limited resource. You don't run out. You just find new ways to share it.'"

Carmen stood and crossed to her mother, taking both her hands. "We've seen how different you are lately, Mamá. How you smile more. How you hum while you're cooking again, like you used to."

"I just needed to know you weren't forgetting Papá," Lucia added softly.

"Never," Silvia whispered fiercely. "How could I? He's in every part of this house, in every part of me. In you three." She squeezed Carmen's hands. "But he's also at peace. And he would want me to be at peace too."

Elena wrapped her arms around her mother from behind. "Then Robert should be here tomorrow. And we should meet him properly."

Lucia joined the embrace. "Besides, we should probably meet the man who's making our mother act like a teenager again."

Silvia laughed, the sound breaking through her tears. "I do not act like a teenager."

"You check your phone every five minutes," Elena pointed out.

"You bought new perfume," Lucia added.

"You actually care about what you wear to the grocery store now," Carmen finished, her own smile finally breaking through.

"Okay, okay," Silvia conceded, pulling back to look at her daughters. "Maybe a little."

They returned to preparing the ofrenda, the atmosphere lighter now. Silvia arranged Eduardo's favorite things with tender care—his baseball cap from the team he'd coached, the harmonica he'd played badly but enthusiastically, a small wooden cross he'd carried in his pocket.

"Tell us about when you first met Robert," Elena said as she strung the papel picado across the ceiling. "The real story."

Silvia felt warmth spread through her chest. "We were seventeen. I was new to the school, barely spoke English, and terrified. He sat next to me in biology class and..." She paused, remembering. "He smiled at me like I was the only person in the room. Like I mattered."

"What happened?" Lucia asked, genuinely curious now.

"Life happened. My family moved back to Mexico. We lost touch. And then I met your father, and I built a beautiful life." She looked at the ofrenda, at the evidence of that life spread before her. "I don't regret any of it. Not a single moment."

Carmen placed a small vase of marigolds next to Eduardo's photo. "But now you have a second chance?"

"Now I have an unexpected gift," Silvia corrected. "Your father gave me one life. Robert is offering me another chapter."

As the afternoon sun slanted through the windows, turning the marigold petals to burnished gold, Silvia and her daughters finished the ofrenda. It was beautiful—a celebration of love and memory, of the man who had shaped their family and the life they had built together.

But as Silvia stepped back to admire their work, she felt something shift inside her. A door opening. A weight lifting. The past and the future, finally finding a way to coexist.

She pulled out her phone and sent a simple text to Robert: *Tomorrow. 6 PM. My daughters are ready to meet you.*

His response came quickly: *Mine too. Thank you for trusting me with this.*

Silvia looked once more at Eduardo's photograph, at the life they had shared, at the daughters they had raised. "Thank you," she whispered. "For everything. For understanding."

The candle flame burned steady and bright, and in her heart, Silvia felt only peace.

---

**The Día de los Muertos Celebration**

On November first, as the sun began its descent toward the horizon, Robert stood on Silvia's front porch with a bundle of fresh marigolds in one hand and a box of pan dulce from the bakery Sarah had recommended in the other. His daughters flanked him—Sarah on his left, Emily on his right, both carrying their own offerings of flowers and food.

The drive over had been quiet, each of them lost in their own thoughts. Robert had changed his shirt three times before settling on a simple blue button-down. His hands had trembled as he'd tied his shoes.

"You ready, Dad?" Emily asked softly.

Robert took a deep breath. "As I'll ever be."

Before he could ring the bell, the door opened. Silvia stood framed in the doorway, backlit by the warm glow of candles from within. She wore a deep burgundy dress embroidered with delicate flowers along the neckline, her silver hair swept up with small marigold blooms tucked into the arrangement.

"Robert." Her face lit up, and then her gaze moved to his daughters. "Sarah, Emily. Welcome. Please, come in."

She stepped back, ushering them across the threshold into a world transformed.

Papel picado in vibrant purples, oranges, and yellows hung in intricate patterns from the ceiling, the delicate cut-paper banners swaying gently in the air currents. The scent of copal incense mingled with cinnamon and chocolate. Candles flickered on every surface, their warm light dancing across framed photographs. The sound of soft guitar music drifted from somewhere deeper in the house.

Robert had been here before—twice, actually, for coffee on quiet afternoons when Silvia's daughters were at work. But the house had never looked like this. It had been transformed into something sacred, a bridge between worlds.

"Mamá, should I—oh." A woman in her mid-thirties appeared from the kitchen, stopping short when she saw the newcomers. She had Silvia's eyes and Eduardo's smile. "You must be Robert."

"This is my oldest, Carmen," Silvia said, her hand finding Robert's. "Carmen, this is Robert, and his daughters Sarah and Emily."

Carmen wiped her hands on her apron and crossed to them, extending her hand first to Robert, then to his daughters. "Welcome to our home. Thank you for bringing flowers—Mamá, should I put these with the others?"

"Please, mija."

Two more women emerged from different parts of the house—Lucia from the dining room with a stack of plates, and Elena from the hallway carrying more candles. Silvia made the introductions, and Robert tried to commit each face and name to memory while his heart hammered against his ribs.

"You're the one from high school," came a voice from the corner. An elderly woman sat in a high-backed chair, studying Robert with sharp, assessing eyes. "Silvia's first love."

"Tía Rosario," Silvia said gently, though Robert heard the warning in her tone. "This is Robert, yes."

"Hmm." Tía Rosario gestured to the empty chair beside her with a gnarled finger. "Come here, *mijo*. Let me look at you properly."

Robert glanced at Silvia, who nodded encouragingly. He crossed the room, aware of everyone watching, and sat down beside the older woman. Up close, he could see she wore a black dress with a rebozo draped across her shoulders, and her fingers were adorned with silver rings.

"You make my niece smile," Tía Rosario said, reaching out to pat his hand. "That's good. It's been too long since she smiled like that. But—" Her grip tightened slightly. "Eduardo was a good man. A very good man."

"I have no doubt," Robert said, meeting her gaze steadily. "Silvia has told me about him. He sounds like someone I would have liked to know."

Tía Rosario studied him for a long moment, then nodded. "You have kind eyes. Like you've known loss too."

"I have."

"Then you understand what you're asking of this family. What it means to be here tonight."

"I do. And I'm honored to be included."

She released his hand and patted his knee. "Go on now. Help yourself to food. And make sure you try the tamales—Lucia makes them even better than her father did, though don't tell her I said so."

The tension in the room seemed to ease. Someone turned up the music—a mariachi version of "Cielito Lindo" that filled the spaces between conversation. People drifted back to their activities, though Robert caught more than one curious glance.

Silvia appeared at his elbow, her eyes bright with unshed tears. "That went well."

"Your aunt is formidable."

"She loved Eduardo like a son. But she loves me more." Silvia took his hand. "Come see the ofrenda. And then I'll introduce you to everyone else properly."

She led him through the dining room, where the table was laden with dishes—tamales, mole, calabaza en tacha, pan de muerto dusted with sugar, and platters of fruit. But it was the ofrenda in the corner that stopped him in his tracks.

It rose in three tiers against the wall, covered in a deep purple cloth. Marigolds cascaded from every level, their orange and yellow blooms brilliant against the fabric. Candles—dozens of them—created a wall of flickering light. And photographs. So many photographs.

"That's my mother and father," Silvia said softly, pointing to a black and white wedding photo on the top tier. "My grandparents. My uncle Carlos who died when I was twelve."

And there, on the second tier, a photograph of a man with kind eyes and salt-and-pepper hair, surrounded by fresh marigolds and a plate of what looked like homemade cookies.

"That's Eduardo," Silvia said quietly. "Those are his favorite cookies—*polvorones*. Carmen made them this morning from his recipe."

Robert studied the photograph. Eduardo wore a plaid shirt and ha
