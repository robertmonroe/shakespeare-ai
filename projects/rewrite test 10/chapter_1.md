# **Scene 1: Angel Baby's Perfect Morning**

The morning sun streamed through the living room window, painting golden stripes across the soft carpet. Angel Baby stretched her tiny black paws forward, her curly tail wiggling with pure happiness. At just one year old, she was the perfect size for a pug—round, wrinkly, and absolutely adorable.

"Good morning, mi angelita!" Mommy Silvia sang out from the kitchen. The sweet smell of coffee drifted through the air, mixing with the scent of cinnamon toast.

Angel Baby's flat little nose twitched. Her big brown eyes sparkled as she trotted toward the sound of Mommy's voice, her paws making soft *pat-pat-pat* sounds on the hardwood floor.

"Look who's awake!" Susana giggled, setting down her backpack near the front door. She crouched down and scratched behind Angel Baby's velvety ears. "Ready for breakfast, little sister?"

*Snort, snort!* Angel Baby's whole body wiggled with excitement. Breakfast was one of her favorite times of day—well, every mealtime was her favorite, really.

Silvia appeared with Angel Baby's special bowl, decorated with tiny bone patterns around the rim. She set it down gently on the kitchen mat. "Here you go, baby. Eat up!"

Angel Baby dove in, munching happily. The kibble crunched between her teeth—*crunch, crunch, crunch*—the most delicious sound in the world.

After breakfast came playtime. Angel Baby grabbed her favorite squeaky toy, a bright blue elephant with floppy ears, and shook it back and forth. *Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!* She pranced around the living room, showing off her prize to anyone who would watch.

"You're so silly!" Susana laughed, tying her shoes for school. "I wish I could stay and play with you all day."

But Susana had to leave for school, and Mommy Silvia had work to do at her desk in the corner. That was okay with Angel Baby. She had her own important business to attend to.

She trotted over to her special spot—the sunny patch by the big window where the warmth pooled like liquid gold on the carpet. The sun had climbed higher now, making the spot extra toasty. Angel Baby circled once, twice, three times, then plopped down with a satisfied *oomph*.

The warmth soaked into her black fur like a cozy blanket. She could see the whole neighborhood from here: leaves tumbling across the yard in shades of orange and red, a squirrel racing up the oak tree, birds hopping along the fence.

Angel Baby's eyes grew heavy. Her breathing slowed to a gentle rhythm—in and out, in and out. Her tiny body rose and fell peacefully.

"Look at her," Silvia whispered into her phone, probably talking to Grandma again. "She's so precious when she sleeps. Yes, yes, she's my little angel..."

Time passed in the most wonderful way—with dreams of treats and belly rubs and endless squeaky toys. Angel Baby's paws twitched as she dreamed of chasing butterflies through fields of flowers.

When she finally woke up, the sun had shifted. The air felt different somehow—cooler, crisper. Angel Baby yawned, showing all her tiny teeth, and stretched again.

Mommy Silvia was moving around the living room now, humming a cheerful tune. She had that sparkle in her eyes, the one that usually meant something exciting was about to happen.

"Angel Baby," Silvia called sweetly, reaching for a colorful shopping bag on the couch. "Mommy has a surprise for you!"

Angel Baby's ears perked up. Surprises usually meant treats or new toys. Her tail started to wag as she trotted over, her whole body full of hope and curiosity.

But as Silvia reached into the bag and pulled out something soft and pink, Angel Baby's wagging slowed. That didn't look like a treat. That didn't look like a toy.

That looked like... *clothes*.

**Scene 2: Silvia arrives home carrying a...**

**Scene 2: Silvia arrives home carrying a shopping bag**

The front door swung open with a cheerful jingle of keys, and Angel Baby's ears perked up from her favorite spot on the living room rug. Mommy Silvia stepped inside, her cheeks flushed pink from the cold autumn air, carrying a bright shopping bag that crinkled with promise.

"Girls! Come see what I found!" Silvia's voice bubbled with excitement as she kicked off her shoes and hurried into the living room.

Angel Baby's curly tail wagged cautiously. Shopping bags usually meant one of two things: delicious treats or... something else. She trotted closer, her little black nose twitching as she investigated.

Susana looked up from her coloring book, her eyes lighting up. "What is it, Mommy?"

Silvia knelt down on the soft carpet, setting the bag between them. The afternoon sunlight streaming through the window caught the shimmer of tissue paper as she reached inside. With a flourish, she pulled out a bundle of soft fabric and held it up.

"Ta-da! Look at this adorable sweater I found for Angel Baby!"

The sweater unfurled like a tiny banner of doom—at least, that's how Angel Baby saw it. It was undeniably beautiful: a cozy knit creation in shades of coral pink and cream, with delicate white buttons running down the back and a precious little collar. The fabric looked impossibly soft, the kind that begged to be touched.

"Oh, Mommy! It's so pretty!" Susana squealed, reaching out to feel the material. "It's so fuzzy!"

Angel Baby took a small step backward, her dark eyes fixed on the sweater. It looked suspiciously like the thing Mommy had tried to put on her last winter—the thing that felt weird and restricting and made her feel like a stuffed toy instead of a proper pug.

Silvia held the sweater up to the light, admiring the craftsmanship. "I saw it in the window at that little boutique downtown, and I just couldn't resist. It's perfect for our holiday shopping trip this weekend!" She turned to Angel Baby with a warm smile. "You're going to look absolutely precious, mi amor."

Angel Baby's tail stopped wagging. Her whole body tensed as Silvia brought the sweater closer, letting her sniff it. The fabric smelled new and slightly perfumed, nothing like her familiar blankets or the worn cushions she loved.

"See? It's so soft and warm," Silvia cooed, running her fingers through the knit. "The lady at the store said it's made especially for little dogs. It won't be itchy at all."

Susana scooted closer on her knees, her hands clasped together. "Can we try it on her now? Please, please, please?"

"Well..." Silvia glanced at Angel Baby, who had now backed up another step, her expression shifting from curious to decidedly suspicious. "We should probably let her get used to seeing it first. What do you think, Angel Baby? Don't you want to stay nice and cozy when we go out in the cold?"

Angel Baby's answer was written clearly in her wrinkled little face: absolutely not.

Silvia laughed softly, folding the sweater over her arm. "I know that look. But sweet girl, it's getting chilly outside. You'll need this to stay warm." She reached out to stroke Angel Baby's velvety head. "We're going to have such a wonderful time shopping together. You'll ride in your stroller, and everyone will say how beautiful you look."

The word "stroller" usually made Angel Baby's tail wag—she loved her stroller rides, watching the world go by from her cozy seat. But right now, all she could focus on was that sweater draped over Mommy's arm, waiting like a soft, colorful trap.

Susana giggled, noticing Angel Baby's wary stance. "I think she knows what's coming, Mommy."

"I think you're right," Silvia said with an amused smile. She stood up, sweater in hand, and walked toward the hallway. "Let me hang this up for now. We'll try it on after dinner."

As Silvia disappeared down the hall, Angel Baby remained frozen in place, staring after her. The sweater was in the house now. It was only a matter of time before the battle began.

**Scene 3: The moment Silvia approaches w...**

**Scene 3: The Great Escape**

The moment Silvia approached with the sweater held out in front of her, Angel Baby's dark eyes grew as round as the treats in her cookie jar.

"No, no, no, no, no!" her little body seemed to say, though all that came out was a sharp snort.

Her stubby legs sprang into action, and she darted across the hardwood floor, her paws clicking frantically as she scrambled under the coffee table. There, in the shadowy safety beneath the wooden surface, Angel Baby pressed herself flat against the cool floor—as flat as a little black pug pancake.

"Angel Baby, sweetie, come out from there," Silvia cooed, kneeling down and peering into the dim space. The sweater dangled from her hand like a soft, pink threat.

Angel Baby scooted backward, her wrinkled face scrunched in determination. Her curly tail, usually perky and proud, tucked tight against her bottom.

"She looks like a fuzzy black rug!" Susana giggled, dropping to her hands and knees beside her mother. "Angel, it's just a sweater. It's so pretty! Don't you want to look fancy?"

Angel Baby snorted again—a sound that clearly meant "absolutely not."

Silvia reached under the table, her fingers wiggling encouragingly. "Come on, my little love. We can't stay under here all day."

But Angel Baby had other plans. The moment Silvia's hand got close, she bolted to the right, squeezing out from under the opposite side of the table with surprising speed for such a chunky pug. Her ears flapped as she ran, and her breathing came in excited little huffs.

"She's heading for the couch!" Susana called out, scrambling to her feet.

Sure enough, Angel Baby dove behind the large gray sofa, wedging herself into the narrow space between the couch and the wall. The gap was barely wide enough for her round body, but somehow she managed to squeeze in, disappearing into the shadows like a furry little escape artist.

Silvia sighed, though a smile tugged at the corners of her mouth. "Angel Baby, you're being very silly. It's just a sweater, mi amor."

From behind the couch came a muffled grunt of protest.

Susana peeked over the back of the sofa, trying to spot the stubborn pug. "I can see her little butt! Her tail is still sticking out!"

"Angel," Silvia said, her voice gentle but firm as she walked around to the side of the couch. "We need to get ready for our special trip. You'll love the holiday lights and all the people who will want to pet you. But it's cold outside, baby girl. You need to stay warm."

Silence from behind the couch.

Then, slowly, a black wrinkled face emerged from the shadows, just enough for one suspicious eye to peek out at Silvia.

"There's my sweet girl," Silvia whispered, crouching down with the sweater folded in her lap. "I promise it won't be so bad. Just try it on for Mommy?"

Angel Baby's eye narrowed. In a flash, she pulled back and shot out from the other end of the couch, her paws skittering on the floor as she made a break for the dining room.

"She's too fast!" Susana laughed, giving chase.

Under the dining table Angel Baby went, weaving between the chair legs like an obstacle course champion. Her breathing was heavy now, her pink tongue lolling out the side of her mouth, but her determination never wavered.

Silvia followed more slowly, the sweater still in her hands. "Angel Baby, you're going to tire yourself out, sweetheart."

But Angel Baby was already on the move again. She emerged from under the dining table and made a dash for her favorite sunny spot by the window—only to find Susana had anticipated her move and was already standing there, arms outstretched.

"Gotcha!" Susana said with a grin.

Angel Baby skidded to a stop, her paws sliding slightly on the smooth floor. She looked left, then right, searching for another escape route. Her sides heaved with each breath, and a thin line of drool stretched from her mouth.

Silvia approached from behind, moving slowly and calmly. "Okay, little one. Game over. Time to be a good girl."

Angel Baby spun around to face her, backing up until her bottom bumped against Susana's legs. She was trapped.

"It's okay, Angel," Susana said softly, kneeling down and gently stroking the pug's warm, soft head. "Mommy's not trying to hurt you. The sweater will keep you cozy."

Silvia knelt in front of Angel Baby, holding the sweater open. "Just your head first, baby. That's all. Just slip your little head through."

Angel Baby looked at the sweater, then at Silvia, then back at the sweater. Her whole body seemed to deflate with resignation, though her eyes still held a glimmer of stubborn protest.

As Silvia moved the sweater closer, Angel Baby began to wiggle—not to run this time, but to squirm and twist as if she could somehow make herself too slippery to dress. Her head ducked down, her shoulders hunched up, and she pulled her front legs in tight against her chest.

"Angel Baby, you're making this so much harder than it needs to be," Silvia said with a gentle laugh, trying to guide the sweater's neck hole over the pug's head.

Angel Baby's ears folded back, and she let out a long, dramatic groan that seemed to come from the very depths of her soul. As the soft fabric touched her head, she shook violently, as if trying to shake off water after a bath.

"Hold still, sweetie," Silvia murmured, finally managing to get the sweater over Angel Baby's head. But getting her front legs through the arm holes proved to be an entirely different challenge.

Angel Baby went completely rigid, her legs locked straight like little black posts. When Silvia tried to bend one leg to guide it through an arm hole, Angel Baby pulled it back. When Silvia tried the other leg, the same thing happened.

"She's like a little statue!" Susana observed, giggling at the pug's stiff, unyielding posture.

"A very stubborn little statue," Silvia agreed, her patience tested but still holding strong.

After several minutes of gentle coaxing, wiggling, and patient maneuvering, Silvia finally managed to get both of Angel Baby's front legs through the arm holes. She quickly pulled the sweater down over the pug's round body and adjusted it so it sat properly.

"There!" Silvia said triumphantly, sitting back on her heels. "All done! See? That wasn't so terrible, was it?"

Angel Baby stood perfectly still, as if moving might somehow make the situation worse. The pink sweater hugged her compact body, the soft fabric decorated with tiny white hearts. She looked down at herself, then up at Silvia with an expression of pure betrayal.

**Scene 4: After a comical chase around t...**

**Scene 4: After a comical chase around the room**

Victory! Silvia held the wriggling black pug firmly but gently, the pink sweater finally stretched over Angel Baby's head. "There we go, mi amor. Just one little paw at a time."

Angel Baby twisted her body like a furry pretzel, her back legs kicking at the air as Silvia guided first one paw, then the other through the sweater's sleeves. The soft fabric settled across her small body, and Silvia adjusted the hem, making sure everything sat just right.

"Perfect!" Silvia clapped her hands together. "Oh, Angel Baby, you look so—"

The moment Silvia's hands released her, Angel Baby dropped to the hardwood floor like a fallen star. She rolled onto her back, all four paws pointed at the ceiling, wiggling frantically from side to side. Her curly tail thrashed as she rubbed her back against the smooth wood, trying desperately to push the sweater up and over her head.

"Angel, no!" Silvia laughed, reaching down to right her.

But Angel Baby had already flipped onto her belly. She backed up rapidly toward the coffee table, her bottom bumping against the wooden leg with a soft *thunk*. She pressed harder, hoping the furniture might somehow catch the sweater's edge and pull it off.

*Thunk. Thunk. Thunk.*

"Susana, look at her!" Silvia giggled, covering her mouth.

Susana sat cross-legged on the couch, watching the show with wide eyes. "She really doesn't like it, Mommy."

Angel Baby abandoned the coffee table and tried a new approach. She planted her front paws firmly on the floor and scooted her rear end backward across the room, dragging herself along like a tiny, disgruntled mop. The sweater, however, remained stubbornly in place.

Frustrated, she sat down with a heavy *plop*, her little chest heaving with the effort of her escape attempts. She looked up at Silvia with enormous dark eyes—eyes that seemed to grow larger and sadder with each passing second. Her bottom lip would have trembled if pugs could manage such a thing. Instead, she let out a long, mournful whimper that echoed through the living room.

"Oh, no you don't." Silvia knelt down, meeting those pleading eyes. "Those puppy-dog eyes won't work this time, Angel Baby."

Angel Baby's ears drooped. She tilted her head to one side, then the other, maintaining her sorrowful gaze. Another soft whine escaped her wrinkled muzzle.

Silvia's resolve wavered for just a moment. "I know it feels strange, sweet girl. But you'll get used to it, I promise."

Angel Baby remained frozen in place, sitting as still as a statue. Only her eyes moved, tracking Silvia's every gesture. The pink sweater covered her round belly and sturdy back, the fabric rising and falling with each breath. She looked utterly defeated, a tiny prisoner in her cozy, soft jail.

Susana climbed down from the couch and approached carefully. "Maybe she needs a treat to feel better?"

"Nice try, but Angel Baby needs to learn that sometimes we wear things we don't love." Silvia stroked the pug's head gently. "Besides, once we get to the holiday market and she sees all the wonderful sights, she'll forget all about her sweater."

At the word "market," Angel Baby's ears perked up slightly. She knew that word. Markets meant new smells, interesting people, and sometimes—if she was very lucky—dropped bits of food to investigate.

But still, the sweater felt wrong. It hugged her body in places nothing had hugged before. It made her feel trapped, confined, unable to be her true, naked self.

She sat there on the living room floor, a picture of pure misery, waiting to see what would happen next.

**Scene 5: Silvia kneels down to Angel Ba...**

**Scene 5: Silvia kneels down to Angel Baby's level**

Silvia lowered herself to the floor with a soft sigh, crossing her legs and patting the carpet beside her. Angel Baby, still half-hidden beneath the coffee table, watched her mommy with wary dark eyes.

"Come here, mi amor," Silvia said gently, her voice as warm as hot chocolate on a winter morning.

Angel Baby's curly tail twitched. She inched forward just a little, her black paws sliding across the hardwood until she was close enough to sniff Silvia's outstretched hand.

"I know you don't like the sweater," Silvia began, stroking the soft wrinkles on Angel Baby's forehead. "But let me tell you why it's so important today."

Susana settled onto the couch behind them, pulling her own jacket closer. Through the window, gray clouds hung low in the sky, and a cold wind rattled the windowpanes.

"It's getting very chilly outside," Silvia continued, gathering Angel Baby into her lap. The little pug didn't resist this time, though her body remained tense. "And today is special—we're going to the mall to see all the beautiful holiday decorations!"

Angel Baby's ears perked up slightly at the excitement in Silvia's voice.

"There will be giant Christmas trees with sparkling lights," Silvia said, her eyes brightening as she painted the picture. "And music playing, and so many people who will want to say hello to the cutest pug they've ever seen." She booped Angel Baby's nose playfully.

"And the pet store!" Susana added from the couch. "Remember how much you love visiting the pet store, Angel?"

Angel Baby's tail gave a small wag at that. The pet store meant treats, and new smells, and sometimes even other dogs to sniff through the glass.

Silvia cupped Angel Baby's wrinkled face in both hands, looking directly into those round, expressive eyes. "But here's the thing, baby girl. It's too cold for you outside without protection. Your little body isn't made for this weather. The sweater isn't to make you uncomfortable—it's to keep you safe and warm so you can enjoy all these wonderful things with us."

Angel Baby let out a small whimper, but it was softer now, less insistent.

"I would never let anything hurt you," Silvia whispered, pressing a kiss to the top of Angel Baby's velvety head. "The sweater is like a hug from me, even when we're walking through the cold. It means I'm taking care of you."

The living room fell quiet except for the ticking of the wall clock and the distant hum of traffic outside. Angel Baby leaned into Silvia's chest, feeling the steady rhythm of her heartbeat.

"So what do you say?" Silvia asked softly. "Can we try one more time? For our special adventure?"

Angel Baby looked up at her mommy's kind face, then over at Susana, who was smiling hopefully. She glanced at the red sweater still lying on the couch, looking somehow less threatening now.

With a resigned little grunt, Angel Baby licked Silvia's chin—her way of saying okay.

"That's my brave girl!" Silvia beamed, reaching for the sweater once more. "Now, let's do this together. Nice and slow."

This time, when Silvia held up the sweater, Angel Baby didn't run.

**Scene 6: Silvia lifts Angel Baby (still...**

**Scene 6: Silvia lifts Angel Baby (still wearing the sweater) into her special stroller**

Silvia bent down and scooped Angel Baby into her arms, sweater and all. "Come on, my little grump. Into your chariot we go!"

Angel Baby's dark eyes widened as she realized what was happening. The stroller. Her beloved pink-and-white stroller with the cushioned seat and the clear dome cover that let her see everything during their walks. Any other day, she would have wagged her curly tail with joy at the sight of it waiting by the front door.

But today? Today she was trapped in this itchy, confining sweater.

"There we go, sweet girl." Silvia gently lowered her into the stroller's cozy interior. Angel Baby settled onto the familiar cushion with a resigned huff, her little body stiff with protest. She lifted one paw and scratched at the sweater's neckline, trying once more to wiggle free.

"Susana, honey, can you grab the reusable shopping bags from the kitchen?" Silvia called over her shoulder as she adjusted the stroller's safety strap around Angel Baby's middle.

"Got them!" Susana appeared moments later, her arms full of colorful tote bags. Her eyes sparkled with excitement. "Are we really going to the holiday market downtown? The one with all the lights?"

"We sure are." Silvia smiled, reaching for her coat from the rack by the door. "And then maybe hot chocolate afterward."

Susana did a little hop of delight and began pulling on her own jacket—a puffy red one with white snowflakes. "Angel Baby's going to love seeing all the decorations!"

Angel Baby tilted her head, her velvety ears perking up slightly at the enthusiasm in Susana's voice. She watched as her sister zipped up her coat and wrapped a striped scarf around her neck. Through the window beside the door, Angel Baby could see gray clouds hanging low in the sky, and the bare tree branches swaying in the wind.

It did look cold out there.

Silvia knelt beside the stroller, her face level with Angel Baby's. "I know you don't like your new sweater, baby girl," she said softly, running a gentle finger along Angel Baby's wrinkled forehead. "But Mommy needs you to stay warm and healthy. We're going to have so much fun together—just wait and see."

Angel Baby stared at her mommy with those big, soulful eyes. She gave another experimental tug at the sweater with her paw, but it didn't budge.

"Ready?" Silvia stood and gripped the stroller handle.

"Ready!" Susana positioned herself by the door, her hand on the knob.

As Susana pulled the door open, a gust of chilly November air rushed into the entryway, making Angel Baby's whiskers twitch. She felt the cold breeze ruffle the fur on her face—the only part of her not covered by the dreaded sweater.

And then, for just a moment, she noticed something. The parts of her body wrapped in the soft red fabric felt... not cold. Actually, they felt kind of... okay.

She wouldn't admit it, of course. She maintained her most skeptical expression as Silvia pushed the stroller forward, its wheels gliding smoothly over the threshold.

"Here we go, Angel Baby!" Susana sang out, skipping ahead down the front path. "Adventure time!"

Angel Baby sat very still in her stroller, the sweater snug around her small body, as her family stepped out into the crisp afternoon. The door clicked shut behind them, and the holiday shopping trip began.

Despite everything, Angel Baby's nose twitched with curiosity. What adventures awaited on this mysterious outing? She supposed—just maybe—she would have to wait and see.

Even if she had to do it while wearing a sweater.
