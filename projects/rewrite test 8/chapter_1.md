## Chapter 1: The Unwanted Gift

**Scene 1: Susana arrives at the house with a special surprise**

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the living room windows, casting golden rectangles across the hardwood floor where Angel Baby lay sprawled on her favorite plush rug. Her little black body rose and fell with contented snores, one pink tongue peeking out from between her wrinkled lips.

The doorbell's cheerful chime jolted her awake. Angel Baby's ears perked up—well, as much as a pug's folded ears could perk—and she scrambled to her feet, toenails clicking against the wood as she waddled toward the front door, her curly tail wagging with anticipation.

"Susana's here!" Silvia called out, her voice bright with warmth as she hurried from the kitchen, wiping her hands on a dish towel.

The door swung open, and there stood Susana, her dark hair pulled back in a ponytail, her face glowing with barely contained excitement. But it wasn't just Susana that caught Angel Baby's attention—it was the curious contraption beside her. A stroller, but not like the ones Angel Baby had seen at the park with human babies inside. This one was different. Smaller. Special.

"Surprise!" Susana announced, wheeling the stroller across the threshold. The wheels glided smoothly over the floor with a soft whisper.

"Oh my goodness!" Silvia pressed her hands to her cheeks, her eyes widening. "Susana, is that—?"

"For our Angel Baby," Susana confirmed, beaming as she parked the stroller in the center of the living room. "I saw it and immediately thought of her. Look at this—it's perfect for a little pug with short legs."

Angel Baby circled the strange new object, her wet nose working overtime as she sniffed every inch. It smelled like new fabric and plastic, with the faintest hint of the store where it had come from. The stroller was a cheerful red and black, with mesh windows on the sides and a cozy padded interior that looked surprisingly inviting.

"Come here, mi amor," Silvia cooed, scooping Angel Baby into her arms. The little pug grunted softly, her warm body relaxing against her mommy's chest. "Let's try it out!"

Susana unzipped the front opening with a flourish. "See? The opening is nice and wide, so she can get in and out easily. And look—" She pointed to the mesh panels. "Plenty of ventilation, so she can see everything and everyone can see her adorable face."

Silvia gently lowered Angel Baby into the stroller. The little pug's paws touched the soft cushioned bottom, and she turned in a small circle, testing this new space. It was snug but comfortable, like a moving bed. She could see out through the mesh, watching her mommy's delighted expression and Susana's proud smile.

"Oh, Angel Baby, look at you!" Silvia clasped her hands together. "You're like a little princess in her carriage!"

Angel Baby tilted her head, her big brown eyes blinking up at them. She wasn't entirely sure what to make of this development, but the attention was nice, and the cushion beneath her paws was certainly comfortable.

Susana knelt down beside the stroller, reaching through the opening to scratch behind Angel Baby's ears. "No more tired legs on long walks, sweet girl. Now you can go everywhere with Mommy without getting exhausted."

"This is wonderful!" Silvia's voice bubbled with excitement. "We can go to the mall, to the outdoor shopping center—oh! The holiday decorations are already up downtown. We could spend the whole afternoon out together!"

"That's exactly what I was thinking," Susana said, standing up and dusting off her knees. "The holidays are coming, and I know how much Angel Baby hates being left at home. This way, she's part of everything."

Angel Baby yawned, her little pink tongue curling, and settled down into the cushion. Maybe this stroller thing wasn't so bad after all. She watched as her mommy and big sister continued talking, their voices animated and full of plans.

"We should take her out this weekend," Silvia said, already pulling out her phone to check the weather. "Oh, but wait—it's going to be cold. She'll need something warm to wear in the stroller."

Susana nodded thoughtfully. "A sweater would be perfect. Something cozy to keep her comfortable during your adventures."

Angel Baby's ears twitched at the unfamiliar word—sweater—but she paid it no mind. She was too busy enjoying the gentle rocking motion as Silvia carefully pushed the stroller back and forth across the living room floor, testing it out.

"Look at her!" Silvia laughed. "She's already getting sleepy. She loves it!"

The two women exchanged knowing smiles over the stroller, their affection for the little black pug evident in every gesture and word. Outside, the late autumn wind rustled through the trees, a whisper of the colder days to come.

But inside, in the warm glow of the living room, Angel Baby dozed peacefully in her new stroller, completely unaware that her mommy was already planning a shopping trip that would introduce something far less welcome than this comfortable new ride.

**Scene 2: Silvia's eyes light up with id...**

# Scene 2: Silvia's eyes light up with ideas

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the living room windows, casting warm golden patches across the cream-colored carpet where Angel Baby had flopped down for her post-excitement nap. The new stroller sat nearby, its navy fabric still smelling faintly of the store—a mixture of plastic and possibility.

Silvia settled onto the sofa, her phone already in hand, but her gaze kept drifting to the stroller, then to Angel Baby's sleeping form, then back again. A smile spread across her face, growing wider with each passing moment.

"Angel Baby," she said softly, her voice bubbling with barely contained enthusiasm.

One of Angel Baby's velvety ears twitched.

"Angel Baby, mi amor," Silvia tried again, a little louder this time.

The little pug's eyes blinked open, still heavy with sleep. She lifted her wrinkled face, her curly tail giving a drowsy wag.

Silvia slid off the sofa and sat cross-legged on the floor beside her precious companion. "I just had the most wonderful idea!" She reached out to scratch behind Angel Baby's ears in that perfect spot that always made the pug lean into her touch. "Do you know what this stroller means?"

Angel Baby's tail wagged faster, responding to the excitement in Silvia's voice even if she couldn't understand the words.

"It means we can go to the mall together! The Christmas decorations are already up—oh, Angel Baby, you should see them! There's a giant tree in the center court with lights that sparkle like stars." Silvia's hands moved expressively as she spoke, painting pictures in the air. "And they have those beautiful window displays with the moving reindeer and the toy trains."

Angel Baby sat up fully now, her dark eyes fixed on Silvia's animated face. She could sense her mommy's joy, and it made her own little body wiggle with sympathetic excitement.

"We could go every weekend," Silvia continued, her mind already planning their adventures. "Maybe even during the week after work, when they have the evening shoppers and everything is lit up so pretty. You'll ride in your stroller like the little princess you are, and everyone will stop to admire how cute you look."

She pulled Angel Baby into her lap, cradling the warm, compact body against her chest. Angel Baby's tail wagged so hard her entire back end shimmied.

"I can take you to see Santa! Oh my goodness, we need to get your picture with Santa this year." Silvia pressed a kiss to the top of Angel Baby's wrinkled head. "And we can walk past the bakery—they always have those wonderful smells coming out. Cinnamon and vanilla and fresh bread."

Angel Baby snorted softly, her pushed-in nose making its characteristic sound of contentment.

"We'll spend so much time together, just you and me." Silvia's voice softened, becoming tender. "No more leaving you home while I run errands. No more rushing because I know your little legs get tired. We can take our time, enjoy everything together."

She gazed down at Angel Baby, her eyes shining with love and anticipation. The pug gazed back, her tongue lolling out in a happy smile, completely trusting and adoring.

"But wait," Silvia said, her expression shifting as a practical thought struck her. She gently set Angel Baby back on the carpet and stood up, walking to the window. "It's getting cold out there. Really cold."

Angel Baby followed, her nails clicking on the hardwood floor as she trotted after her mommy.

Silvia looked out at the December afternoon. The trees in the front yard had lost most of their leaves, and the sky held that particular gray-white quality that promised winter's arrival. A neighbor walked past bundled in a thick coat, their breath visible in the chilly air.

"You'll need something warm to wear," Silvia murmured, more to herself than to Angel Baby. "Something cozy and comfortable. Something that will keep my baby girl warm while we're out having our adventures."

She turned back to look at Angel Baby, who sat at her feet, head tilted quizzically to one side.

"A sweater!" Silvia announced, snapping her fingers. "A beautiful sweater, perfect for a beautiful girl. We'll get you the prettiest one we can find."

Angel Baby's tail wagged uncertainly. She didn't understand the word "sweater," but she understood the love in Silvia's voice, the way her mommy's whole face glowed with plans and promises.

Silvia picked up her phone again, this time with purpose. "Let me see what they have online. We need to find something special. Something as special as you are, mi angelita."

As Silvia scrolled through images of dog sweaters, murmuring appreciatively at various options, Angel Baby curled up at her feet. The living room felt warm and safe, filled with the comfortable sounds of home—the soft click of Silvia's phone, the distant hum of the refrigerator, the occasional car passing outside.

"This one!" Silvia exclaimed suddenly. "Angel Baby, look at this one!"

She crouched down, showing her phone to the pug as if Angel Baby could appreciate the image on the screen. "It's red—your color! With little white snowflakes. Oh, it's perfect. Absolutely perfect."

Angel Baby sniffed at the phone, more interested in the faint scent of Silvia's hand cream than the image displayed.

"I'm ordering it right now," Silvia declared, her fingers flying across the screen. "Express shipping. It'll be here in two days, and then we can start our mall adventures. Just think, Angel Baby—this weekend, we could already be strolling through the holiday displays, warm and cozy together."

She completed the purchase with a satisfied tap and set the phone aside. Scooping Angel Baby up once more, she hugged her close, swaying slightly as if dancing to music only she could hear.

"Everything is going to be perfect," Silvia whispered into the pug's soft fur. "Our first winter with the stroller. Our special mommy-and-daughter time. You're going to love it, I promise."

Angel Baby nestled into the embrace, completely content in this moment, blissfully unaware of the red sweater already making its way toward her, unaware of the battles that would soon unfold. For now, there was only warmth, love, and the gentle rhythm of her mommy's heartbeat.

Outside, the December wind picked up, rattling the windows slightly—a whisper of the cold that would soon make Silvia's plans seem not just lovely, but necessary.

**Scene 3: Silvia returns from a shopping...**

**Scene 3: Silvia returns from a shopping trip with a beautiful red sweater**

The front door clicked open, and Angel Baby's ears perked up from her favorite spot on the living room carpet. She lifted her head, her dark eyes brightening at the familiar sound of Silvia's footsteps in the entryway.

"Angel Baby! Mami's home!" Silvia's voice rang out, warm and excited.

Angel Baby scrambled to her feet, her curly tail wagging in tight circles as she trotted toward the door. Her nails clicked against the hardwood floor, and she let out a soft snort of greeting.

Silvia knelt down, setting her shopping bags aside to scratch behind Angel Baby's velvety ears. "I have a surprise for you, mi amor. Something very special."

Angel Baby tilted her head, watching as Silvia reached into one of the glossy bags. The tissue paper crinkled and rustled, releasing a strange new scent—something chemical and unfamiliar that made Angel Baby's nose twitch.

"Look!" Silvia held up a small garment, her face glowing with delight. "Isn't it perfect?"

The thing dangled from Silvia's hands, bright red and oddly shaped. Angel Baby took a cautious step forward, her tail slowing its enthusiastic wagging. The color was vibrant, almost too bright, catching the afternoon light streaming through the window.

"It's a sweater, baby girl. For you!" Silvia's voice bubbled with enthusiasm. "See how soft it is? Feel this material—it's the finest knit I could find."

She lowered the sweater closer to Angel Baby, who leaned in tentatively. Her black nose twitched as she investigated this strange object. It smelled wrong—not like home, not like Silvia, not like anything in her familiar world. The scent was sharp and new, with hints of plastic and dye.

Angel Baby pulled back slightly, her wrinkled brow furrowing deeper than usual.

"With your new stroller and this beautiful sweater, we can go everywhere together this winter," Silvia continued, running her fingers over the red fabric. "The mall, the park, even when it's cold outside. You'll be so warm and cozy, just like a little princess."

The sweater had small sleeves—Angel Baby could see the holes where her legs would supposedly go. There was ribbing around what must be the neck, and tiny white buttons decorating the back. Silvia turned it this way and that, showing off every angle with obvious pride.

Angel Baby sat down heavily on her haunches, her expression doubtful. The thing looked confining. Restrictive. Not at all like the freedom of her own smooth, fawn-colored fur.

"Tomorrow we'll try it on, okay?" Silvia said, folding the sweater carefully and placing it on the entryway table. "You're going to look so adorable, mi cielo. Everyone at the mall will stop to admire you."

Angel Baby stared at the red bundle on the table, a small whimper escaping her throat. Something told her that tomorrow was going to be very different from the comfortable days she'd known before.

Silvia scooped her up, pressing a kiss to the top of her wrinkled head. "Don't worry, baby. You'll love it once you get used to it."

But as Angel Baby glanced back at the sweater over Silvia's shoulder, uncertainty settled in her chest like a stone. The bright red fabric seemed to mock her from its perch, waiting.

**Scene 4: Silvia attempts to dress Angel...**

**Scene 4: Silvia attempts to dress Angel Baby in the red sweater for the first time**

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the living room window, casting warm golden patches across the carpet where Angel Baby had been napping peacefully. She stirred awake to find Silvia sitting cross-legged on the floor beside her, holding something bright red and soft in her hands.

"Come here, mi amor," Silvia cooed, her voice honey-sweet. "Mommy has something special for you."

Angel Baby's tail gave a cautious wag as she stretched, her front paws extending forward while her bottom stayed up in the air. She blinked her big brown eyes, still drowsy from her nap.

Silvia unfolded the red sweater, smoothing it out so Angel Baby could see. "Look how pretty this is! It's going to keep you so warm when we go out together."

The little pug tilted her head, her wrinkled forehead creasing even more as she studied the strange garment. It looked soft enough, but something about it made her uneasy.

"Okay, baby girl, let's try this on." Silvia's voice remained gentle as she gathered the sweater and reached for Angel Baby's front paw. "Just put this little paw right through here..."

The moment Silvia's fingers guided her paw toward the sleeve opening, Angel Baby felt a flutter of panic in her chest. She pulled her paw back quickly, tucking it under her chest.

"No, no, it's okay," Silvia reassured, stroking Angel Baby's head with her free hand. "It won't hurt, I promise. Come on now, just one paw."

With patient determination, Silvia tried again. This time she managed to slip Angel Baby's right paw through the sleeve before the pug could protest. The fabric felt strange—foreign and confining against her fur. Angel Baby immediately tried to shake it off, but Silvia was already reaching for her left paw.

"Good girl! Now the other one. Almost done, almost done..."

Angel Baby's heart began to race. As the second sleeve slid up her leg, she felt the sweater closing in around her body. The soft material that had looked so innocent now felt like a trap. She wiggled her shoulders, trying to create space between the fabric and her fur.

"Hold still, baby. Just let Mommy—"

But Angel Baby had no intention of holding still. As Silvia attempted to pull the sweater over her back, the little pug twisted her entire body to the left, then to the right. Her stubby legs scrambled against the carpet, searching for traction.

"Angel Baby, please," Silvia said, her voice strained with effort as she tried to keep the sweater in place. "If you would just—stop squirming for one second—"

The sweater was halfway on now, covering Angel Baby's front legs and part of her back, but bunching awkwardly around her middle. She could feel it pressing against her sides, restricting the natural expansion of her chest when she breathed. Her curly tail, usually so proudly curled over her back, felt pinned down by the fabric.

Angel Baby let out a small, frustrated snort and began to spin in a circle, her paws working frantically to escape the red prison. The sweater twisted with her, getting more tangled rather than less.

"Baby, you're making it worse!" Silvia reached out to steady her, but Angel Baby was in full panic mode now. She dropped to the carpet and rolled onto her back, her legs kicking at the air, trying to push the sweater off with her paws.

"Oh, Angel..." Silvia sighed, sitting back on her heels. She watched as her little pug continued to thrash and wiggle, looking absolutely miserable. "It's just a sweater. It's supposed to help you."

But Angel Baby didn't care what it was supposed to do. All she knew was how it felt—tight, weird, wrong. She managed to get one paw free of its sleeve and immediately used it to claw at the rest of the garment.

Silvia tried a different approach, her voice taking on a reasoning tone as if Angel Baby could understand every word. "Listen, mi cielo, when we go to the mall, it's going to be cold. And you have such short fur on your belly. Don't you want to be comfortable in your new stroller? Don't you want to go on adventures with Mommy?"

Angel Baby paused her struggling for just a moment, looking up at Silvia with those expressive brown eyes. Her chest heaved with the effort of her resistance, and one ear had folded backward in the chaos.

For a heartbeat, Silvia thought she might have gotten through to her.

Then Angel Baby sneezed—a sharp, indignant little sound—and resumed her wiggling with renewed vigor.

"Okay, okay!" Silvia finally relented, reaching down to help extract the pug from the twisted sweater. "We'll try again later. But Angel Baby, you're going to have to wear this eventually."

As soon as the red fabric lifted away from her body, Angel Baby scrambled to her feet and shook herself vigorously, from her squished nose all the way to her curly tail. Every part of her jiggled with the effort, as if she could shake off the very memory of the sweater's touch.

She trotted several feet away and sat down, fixing Silvia with a look that clearly said, "Never again."

Silvia held up the sweater, now slightly stretched and wrinkled from the battle. She smoothed it out on her lap, her expression a mixture of amusement and exasperation.

"You're so stubborn, you know that?" she said softly, but there was love in her voice. "Just like your mommy."

Angel Baby sneezed again, then began to groom her front paw with exaggerated dignity, as if the entire incident had been beneath her.

Silvia folded the sweater carefully and set it on the arm of the couch, within easy reach. She looked from the innocent-looking garment to her defiant little pug, who was now pointedly ignoring her.

"Tomorrow," Silvia said with quiet determination. "We'll try again tomorrow."

Angel Baby's ear twitched at the word, but she kept her gaze fixed on her paw, licking between her toes with intense concentration. In her small pug heart, she was already planning her escape strategy for next time.

The red sweater sat on the couch arm, waiting patiently, while the afternoon sun continued its slow journey across the living room floor.

**Scene 5: Despite Silvia's patient expla...**

# **Scene 5: Despite Silvia's patient explanations about staying warm and comfortable, Angel Baby continues her determined protests**

Silvia sat cross-legged on the soft cream carpet of the living room, the red sweater draped across her lap like a tiny flag of surrender. Afternoon sunlight streamed through the window, casting warm patches across the floor where Angel Baby had positioned herself—just out of reach, her black button eyes fixed on the offending garment with unmistakable suspicion.

"Come here, my sweet girl," Silvia cooed, patting her knee gently. "Let's try this one more time."

Angel Baby's curly tail, usually bouncing with enthusiasm, tucked slightly. Her wrinkled forehead seemed to furrow even deeper, creating additional valleys of stubborn determination across her fawn-colored face.

"I know it feels strange, mi amor," Silvia continued, her voice honey-soft with understanding. "But winter is coming, and your little legs get so tired in the cold. With your stroller and this beautiful sweater, we can go on such wonderful adventures together. Think of all the holiday lights we'll see! The delicious smells at the mall!"

Angel Baby snorted—a sound that clearly communicated her opinion on the matter.

Silvia reached forward with the sweater, the soft fabric bunched in her hands, ready to slip over Angel Baby's compact body. "Just your front paws first, see? It's not so bad—"

But the moment the sweater's opening came near, Angel Baby transformed into a wiggling, twisting force of pure pug resistance. Her stocky body, surprisingly powerful for something so small, reversed rapidly across the carpet. Her paws scrabbled for purchase on the smooth surface, nails clicking frantically as she backpedaled like a furry little bulldozer in reverse.

"Angel Baby, please," Silvia laughed despite her exasperation, lunging forward to gently catch her determined companion.

She managed to loop the sweater over Angel Baby's head, threading one stubby front leg through the appropriate hole. Victory seemed within reach.

Then Angel Baby deployed her secret weapon: the pug pretzel maneuver.

With a flexibility that seemed impossible for her barrel-shaped body, Angel Baby twisted sideways, tucked her head down, and somehow—impossibly—extracted her leg from the sweater sleeve. The garment hung lopsided for just a moment before Angel Baby gave a mighty shake, sending the sweater flying across the room where it landed in a defeated heap against the bookshelf.

"Oh, mi vida," Silvia sighed, running her fingers through her dark hair. "You are so stubborn."

Angel Baby stood in the center of the living room, her chest heaving with the effort of her escape. She gave herself a thorough shake, starting from her pushed-in nose and rippling all the way down to her tightly curled tail. Each shake seemed to say: *I am free! I am victorious! I am sweater-less!*

Her tongue lolled out in a satisfied pant, and she looked up at Silvia with an expression that radiated pure triumph mixed with just a hint of apology—but not enough apology to suggest she'd cooperate next time.

Silvia picked up the abandoned sweater, smoothing out the wrinkles with gentle hands. She held it up to the light, examining the careful stitching, the perfect size, the cheerful red color that would look so adorable against Angel Baby's fawn coat.

"You don't understand yet, do you, pequeña?" she murmured, more to herself than to her pug. "This isn't about making you uncomfortable. It's about keeping you safe. About making sure we can still do everything together, even when it's cold outside."

Angel Baby tilted her head, her ears perking forward at Silvia's soft tone. But when Silvia made the slightest movement toward her with the sweater, those ears immediately flattened back against her wrinkled skull.

Silvia set the sweater carefully on the arm of the sofa, a splash of red against the beige fabric. She looked at Angel Baby, who had now retreated to her favorite spot behind the coffee table—her fortress of solitude, where she could monitor all sweater-related activities from a safe distance.

"Okay, mi amor. You win... for now," Silvia conceded, though her eyes held a knowing glimmer. "But we're going to need that sweater soon. The mall trip is in three days, and I promise you, you'll want to be warm in your stroller."

Angel Baby responded with another snort, this one distinctly skeptical.

As Silvia stood and headed toward the kitchen, probably to start dinner, Angel Baby remained in her defensive position. She watched the red sweater with unwavering vigilance, as if it might suddenly spring to life and attack her the moment she let down her guard.

The sweater, innocent and motionless on the sofa arm, seemed to wait patiently—as if it knew that this battle was far from over, and that eventually, somehow, it would find its way onto one very stubborn little pug.

But for now, Angel Baby had won. And that was enough.
