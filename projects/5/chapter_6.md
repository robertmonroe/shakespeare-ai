## Chapter 6: The Proposal

**Scene 1: Max arranges to meet Elena at ...**

**Scene 1: Max arranges to meet Elena at their usual café**

The afternoon light slanted through the café's tall windows, casting amber streaks across the worn wooden tables. Max sat in their usual corner, the one Elena had laughingly claimed as "theirs" three weeks ago, and watched the steam curl up from his untouched espresso. His hand rested on the table, steady despite the adrenaline coursing through his veins. He'd rehearsed this moment a hundred times, run through every possible reaction, every contingency. None of it made his chest feel any less tight.

The bell above the door chimed.

Elena entered like a breath of spring in the fading autumn, her cream-colored coat unbuttoned, a silk scarf the color of champagne draped loosely around her neck. She spotted him immediately, and that smile—the one that had become both his weakness and his weapon—transformed her face. Max felt something twist inside him, sharp and unwelcome.

*This is the job. Just the job.*

But he'd stopped believing that lie days ago.

"You look serious," Elena said as she slid into the chair across from him, her accent wrapping around the words like velvet. She reached for his hand, her fingers cool and delicate. "What's wrong?"

Max didn't pull away. Not yet. He memorized the feeling of her touch, knowing it might be the last time she'd offer it willingly.

"I need to talk to you about something." His voice came out rougher than intended.

Her smile faltered. "That sounds ominous."

"Elena." He turned his hand over, clasping hers properly. "What I'm about to tell you—I need you to listen. All the way through. Can you do that?"

The warmth drained from her eyes, replaced by something wary. She withdrew her hand slowly, folding both in her lap. "You're scaring me."

"I'm not an art dealer."

The words hung between them like smoke. Elena's face went very still, that practiced stillness he'd seen her use with Viktor's associates. The mask she wore when she needed to survive.

"What?"

"I work for people who are very interested in your husband's business activities. The real ones. Not the legitimate import-export operations, but what happens in the warehouses after dark. The containers that don't appear on any manifest."

Elena's lips parted, but no sound came out. The color had leached from her cheeks, leaving two spots of rouge standing out like wounds.

Max pressed forward, knowing that hesitation now would doom them both. "I was sent here to get close to you. To use you to get to Viktor. That's the truth."

"Get out." Her voice was barely a whisper.

"Elena—"

"Get out!" The words cracked like a whip. Heads turned at nearby tables. Elena's hands trembled as she gripped the edge of the table, her knuckles white. "You—all of this—every conversation, every—" She couldn't finish, her breath coming in short, sharp gasps.

Max leaned forward, keeping his voice low and urgent. "That's how it started. That was the mission. But it's not—Elena, look at me."

She did, and the betrayal in her eyes nearly broke him.

"It's not what it became," he said. "I need you to understand that. What's between us, what we have—that wasn't part of any plan. That was never supposed to happen."

"How convenient." Her laugh was bitter, brittle. "The spy develops real feelings for his mark. Do they teach you that line in training?"

"I can help you escape him."

That stopped her. Elena's jaw tightened, and for a moment, she looked like she might slap him. Instead, she grabbed her purse, preparing to stand.

"In exchange for what?" The question came out sharp, surgical. "Because men like you don't offer help for free. Viktor taught me that much."

Max pulled a photograph from his jacket pocket and placed it face-down on the table between them. "I need proof. Documents. Evidence of what Viktor is really moving through those ports. Things only you can access."

"You're insane." But she didn't stand. Didn't leave. Her eyes fixed on the photograph like it was a snake that might strike.

"Turn it over," Max said quietly.

Elena's hand shook as she reached for it. When she flipped it, her breath caught. The image showed a warehouse in Hamburg, bodies on the floor, young women's faces frozen in terror and death. The metadata stamp in the corner was dated three months ago.

"This is one of Viktor's operations that went wrong," Max said. "Twenty-three women from Moldova and Ukraine, promised jobs as au pairs in Germany. They're all dead now because the container's refrigeration failed and no one checked on them for four days."

Elena's fingers crumpled the edge of the photo. "Stop."

"There are more. There will always be more, unless someone stops him."

"And you think I—what? That I'll betray my husband for you? For some stranger who's been lying to me since the moment we met?" But her voice cracked on the last word, and tears gathered at the corners of her eyes.

Max reached across the table, stopping just short of touching her. "I think you'll do it because you know what he is. Because you've known for a long time and you've been looking for a way out. I'm offering you that way."

"By making me a traitor."

"By making you free."

The silence stretched between them, thick with everything unsaid. Outside, Vienna moved through its late afternoon rhythms—tourists photographing baroque architecture, businessmen hurrying to appointments, lovers strolling hand-in-hand through streets that had witnessed centuries of secrets and betrayals.

Elena's voice, when it came, was hollow. "What exactly are you proposing?"

Max felt his pulse quicken. She hadn't walked away. That was something. Maybe everything.

"You help me access Viktor's safe. Get me copies of his shipping manifests, his financial records, his contact lists. Everything that proves what he's doing. In exchange, I guarantee you a new identity, money, and safe passage to anywhere in the world you want to go. You disappear. Viktor will never find you."

"You can't promise that."

"I can. And I will."

Elena stared at him, and he watched her mind work behind those dark eyes—calculating, measuring, weighing the cost of trust against the price of staying.

"I need to think," she said finally, standing abruptly. The chair scraped against the floor with a sound like a scream.

"Elena—"

"Don't." She held up a hand, stopping him. "Don't say my name. Don't tell me again that your feelings are real. Don't make this worse than it already is."

She turned to leave, then paused, looking back over her shoulder. The afternoon light caught her profile, and Max saw both the woman he'd come to care for and the frightened girl trapped in a gilded cage.

"If I decide to help you," she said quietly, "it won't be because I believe you. It will be because I have no other choice."

Then she was gone, the bell above the door chiming her exit like a funeral toll.

Max sat alone at their table, the photograph of the dead women face-up between the cooling espresso cups, and wondered if he'd just saved her or destroyed the only real thing he'd felt in years.

His phone buzzed. A text from his handler: *Status?*

Max stared at it for a long moment, then typed: *In progress.*

He didn't mention that his hands were shaking, or that he'd just broken the cardinal rule of his profession. He didn't mention that somewhere in the last three weeks, Elena Volkov had stopped being an asset and become something far more dangerous.

She'd become someone he couldn't afford to lose.

**Scene 2: Elena stands to leave, but Max...**

Elena's chair scraped against the hardwood floor with a finality that made Max's chest constrict. She was already reaching for her coat, her movements sharp and precise, the way people moved when they were trying not to fall apart.

"Elena, please—"

"Don't." Her voice cut like a blade. "Don't say my name like that. Like you know me."

Max stood, his hand instinctively reaching across the table before he caught himself. The bistro hummed around them—the clink of silverware, murmured conversations, the hiss of the espresso machine—but it all felt distant, underwater. Everything depended on the next sixty seconds.

"You're right," he said, keeping his voice low and steady. "The approach was calculated. The gallery, the conversation about Rothko, the coffee—all of it was planned." He watched her fingers pause on her coat button. "But that was three weeks ago, Elena. What happened after... what's happening now... I didn't plan for this."

She turned, and the look in her eyes nearly broke him. Not anger—he could have handled anger. It was the hurt, raw and exposed, mixed with something that looked dangerously close to hope. That hope terrified him more than Viktor's entire organization.

"You're a liar," she said, but her voice wavered. "How am I supposed to believe anything you say?"

Max pulled out his wallet, extracted a worn photograph, and placed it on the table between them. A young woman, blonde, smiling at a beach somewhere. "Her name was Sarah. My partner. We were running surveillance on a trafficking ring in Prague two years ago. She got made because I missed a detail—one detail." He swallowed hard. "They found her in the Vltava River three days later."

Elena's hand moved toward the photograph but didn't touch it.

"I stopped feeling things after that," Max continued. "Became good at my job because I didn't care about anything except the mission. Then I met you." He looked directly at her, letting her see everything he'd been hiding. "And for the first time in two years, I felt something other than guilt and rage. You made me remember what it was like to be human."

"Stop it." But she didn't move toward the door.

"I know about Viktor." Max's voice dropped further. "Not the art collector, not the philanthropist. The real Viktor Volkov. The one who moves girls from Eastern Europe through a network of 'modeling agencies.' The one who has judges and police commissioners on his payroll. The one who killed a sixteen-year-old Ukrainian girl last month because she tried to run."

Elena's face went pale. She sank back into her chair, her coat forgotten.

"Her name was Oksana," Max said quietly. "She looked like you, actually. Same dark hair, same—" He stopped himself. "I'm sorry. But you need to know what you're living with. What you're part of, whether you want to be or not."

"I'm not part of anything." The words came out barely above a whisper.

"I know." Max leaned forward. "That's why I'm here. That's why I'm breaking every protocol, risking my career, probably my life, to have this conversation. Because I know you're not like him. I've watched you, Elena. Not just as surveillance—I've *seen* you. The way you volunteer at that shelter on Tuesdays. How you sneak food to the homeless man outside your building. The books you read when you think no one's watching—Plath, Akhmatova, Szymborska. Women who understood what it meant to be trapped."

A tear slid down her cheek. She wiped it away angrily. "What do you want from me?"

"Viktor has a safe in his study. Private, separate from the main security system. He keeps documents there—evidence of transactions, names, locations. Things he can't digitize because they're too damning." Max paused, watching her carefully. "You're the only person besides Viktor who knows the combination. I've seen you go in there when he's away. Tuesdays and Thursdays, when he meets with Dmitri Kozlov."

Elena's breath caught. "You've been watching me in the house?"

"No. Never inside. I would never—" Max ran a hand through his hair, frustrated. "There's a camera in the oak tree across the street. Building security. I accessed the feeds."

"Jesus Christ." She laughed, but it was a broken sound. "This is insane. You're insane. I'm insane for still sitting here."

"Probably." Max allowed himself a small, sad smile. "But you're still sitting here."

She met his eyes, and something passed between them—recognition, maybe, or resignation. "Even if I wanted to help you, which I'm not saying I do, Viktor would know. He knows everything. He has people everywhere."

"Not everywhere." Max pulled a folded paper from his jacket pocket and slid it across the table. "That's a new identity. Canadian passport, birth certificate, credit history going back fifteen years. There's a cottage in Nova Scotia, paid in full, under that name. Bank account with enough money to last you five years if you're careful, longer if you invest wisely."

Elena stared at the paper without touching it. "You made this before you even talked to me today."

"Yes."

"So you knew. You knew I'd say yes."

"No." Max's voice was firm. "I *hoped* you'd say yes. There's a difference. If you walk out that door right now, that identity is still yours. Whether you help me or not, whether you run or stay, it exists. It's real. Your escape route is real, Elena. I'm giving it to you regardless."

She finally picked up the paper, unfolded it with trembling fingers. The photograph showed her face, but the name read "Claire Morrison." The details were meticulous—birthplace, education history, employment records.

"Why?" she asked. "Why would you do this if you don't know I'll help you?"

Max leaned back, suddenly exhausted. Outside the window, snow had begun to fall, dusting the Cambridge street in white. "Because three weeks ago, I watched you stand in front of a Kandinsky at the MFA for twenty minutes. You were crying. Not obviously—just tears running down your face while you stared at all that color and chaos. And I realized that you were trapped in a life you never chose, with a man you never loved, in a cage made of money and fear." He paused. "I know what that feels like. To be trapped. And I decided right then that even if you couldn't help me, even if this whole operation went to hell, I was going to make sure you had a way out."

Elena's hands shook as she refolded the paper. When she looked up, her eyes were bright with unshed tears, but her voice was steady. "If I do this—and I'm not saying I will—but if I do, what happens to Viktor?"

"He goes to prison. Federal charges, international trafficking, racketeering, murder. He'll die behind bars."

"Good." The word came out hard and cold, and Max saw something shift in her expression. A decision being made in real-time. "He killed Oksana, you said?"

"Yes."

"Tell me about her."

So Max did. He told her about the sixteen-year-old from Lviv who'd been promised a modeling contract in New York. About how she'd ended up in a basement in Southie instead, servicing men who paid Viktor's organization for the privilege. About how she'd managed to get a message to a friend back home, who'd contacted the Ukrainian embassy, who'd alerted the FBI. About how she'd been found in a dumpster behind a restaurant in Dorchester two days before they could extract her, her neck broken, her body showing signs of prolonged abuse.

By the time he finished, Elena's face was stone.

"I want to see the file," she said. "Everything you have on him. Every victim, every transaction, every piece of evidence. I want to know exactly what I'm helping to stop."

"Elena—"

"That's my condition. If you want my help, I need to see it all. I need to know that this is worth it. That I'm not just trading one prison for another, one set of lies for a different set."

Max nodded slowly. "Okay. I can arrange that. But it won't be easy to look at."

"Nothing about my life has been easy." She stood again, but this time her movements were deliberate, controlled. "I need time to think. Two days. Don't contact me, don't follow me, don't send any more

**Scene 3: Two days pass with no contact ...**

**Scene 3: Two days pass with no contact from Elena**

The apartment walls were closing in.

Max stood at the window of his safe house for the third time in an hour, watching the street below where nothing moved except a stray cat picking through garbage bins. The coffee in his hand had gone cold again—he'd lost count of how many cups he'd abandoned throughout the apartment, ceramic monuments to his inability to focus on anything except the phone that refused to ring.

Forty-seven hours. Thirty-two minutes.

He'd stopped pretending he wasn't counting.

The phone sat on the kitchen counter where he could see it from every angle in the cramped space. The screen remained dark, mocking him with its silence. He'd checked it seventeen times in the last hour alone, confirming the volume was up, the battery charged, the signal strong. All functioning perfectly. All completely useless.

*She's gone to Viktor. She's telling him everything right now.*

Max pressed his forehead against the cool glass, watching his breath fog the window. The rational part of his brain—the part trained by a decade of fieldwork—insisted she would have run instead. Smart people didn't confront men like Viktor Volkov with accusations of criminality. They disappeared into the night and never looked back.

But the other part, the part that had emerged somewhere between the Kunsthistorisches Museum and that kiss in the rain, whispered something worse: that she'd simply vanished, slipped away from both Viktor and him, choosing neither monster nor liar but the uncertain freedom of being alone.

His phone buzzed.

Max's heart seized before he registered it was the wrong phone—the encrypted one in his jacket pocket. The handler. He considered not answering, letting it ring out into the void of his professional obligations. But old habits died hard.

"Monroe."

"Status update." Carter's voice carried the clipped efficiency of someone who'd already moved on to the next crisis before finishing the current one. "It's been two days since your last check-in."

Max moved away from the window, pacing the narrow strip of floor between the kitchenette and the sagging couch. "The asset is considering the proposal."

"Considering." The word came back flat, skeptical. "For forty-eight hours."

"It's a significant decision. She needs time."

"What she needs is irrelevant." Papers rustled on Carter's end. "What we need is access to Volkov's records before he moves the shipment. Our window is closing, Monroe. If this asset can't deliver—"

"She can." The words came out harder than intended.

A pause. Max could picture Carter in his climate-controlled office in Langley, leaning back in his leather chair with that expression of calculated assessment. "You sound certain."

"I am."

"Based on what? Your professional judgment or something else?"

The question landed like a blade between ribs. Max stopped pacing, staring at a water stain on the ceiling that looked like a map of somewhere he'd never been. "My professional judgment is that Elena Volkov is intelligent, careful, and motivated. She'll make the right choice."

"And if she doesn't?"

"Then we develop another approach."

"There is no other approach. You know that." Carter's voice dropped, taking on the tone of forced patience he used when explaining obvious things to field agents who'd been out too long. "This operation has consumed significant resources. The deputy director is asking questions. I need something concrete, or I need to know we're pivoting to alternative assets."

Alternative assets. The clinical language for burning Elena entirely, treating her as a lost cause and moving on to someone else in Viktor's orbit. Someone more pliable, more desperate, more easily manipulated.

"Give me another day," Max said.

"You said that yesterday."

"And I'm saying it again."

The silence stretched between them, crackling with unspoken implications. Finally, Carter exhaled. "Twenty-four hours, Monroe. After that, I'm making the call."

The line went dead.

Max set the phone down carefully, fighting the urge to throw it against the wall. The apartment felt smaller than ever, the air thick and stale despite the November chill seeping through the windows. He needed to move, to do something other than stand here drowning in his own thoughts.

He grabbed his jacket and headed out.

---

Vienna in late afternoon was all grey stone and golden light, the sun breaking through clouds to paint the buildings in shades of amber and rust. Max walked without destination, letting his feet carry him through the Innere Stadt while his mind churned through scenarios.

*She told Viktor. They're watching you right now, waiting for you to lead them to your contacts.*

He passed a café where an old woman fed pigeons from a paper bag, the birds swirling around her in a chaos of wings. A street musician played violin near the Stephansdom, the melody something mournful and Eastern European that made Max's chest tighten.

*She ran. She's already in Prague or Budapest or Berlin, starting over with nothing but the clothes on her back.*

He found himself on the Ringstrasse, watching trams glide past with their cargo of commuters heading home to families, to normalcy, to lives that didn't involve lying to beautiful women and waiting for phones to ring. A couple walked by holding hands, laughing about something private and perfect.

*She's considering it. Actually weighing her options, trying to decide if she can trust you after you spent weeks lying to her face.*

That was the worst scenario, somehow. Not because it endangered the mission, but because it meant she was alone with the decision, turning it over in her mind without anyone to help shoulder the weight. He'd done that to her—dropped this impossible choice in her lap and walked away, leaving her to wrestle with it in whatever gilded cage Viktor kept her in.

Max stopped at a bridge over the Wien River, gripping the railing hard enough to make his knuckles white. Below, the water moved dark and quick, carrying leaves and urban debris toward the Danube. He thought about the museum, about Elena standing in front of that Bruegel painting, talking about how the artist showed people just living their lives while tragedy unfolded in the background.

"Most people don't even notice they're in a painting," she'd said.

But she'd noticed. She'd been noticing for years, trapped in the frame of Viktor's world, watching herself become part of the composition whether she wanted to be or not.

His phone buzzed.

Max pulled it out so fast he nearly dropped it into the river. Unknown number. Vienna area code.

His thumb hovered over the screen for a heartbeat that felt like an hour. Then he answered.

"Yes?"

"Tomorrow. Three o'clock." Elena's voice was steady, controlled, but he could hear something underneath—fear or determination or both. "The Zentralfriedhof. Section 32A, near the Brahms grave."

"Elena—"

"Come alone. If I see anyone else, I'm gone."

"I will. I promise."

Another pause, shorter this time. "I need to know something first."

"Anything."

"That night in the rain. When you kissed me." Her voice dropped lower, barely audible over the traffic noise bleeding through the connection. "Was any of it real?"

Max closed his eyes, the river sounds fading into white noise. Every instinct screamed at him to hedge, to maintain operational distance, to give himself room to maneuver. Carter would tell him to say whatever kept the asset engaged. His training demanded he treat this as a tactical question requiring a tactical answer.

"All of it," he said. "Every moment."

He heard her breath catch, a small sound that carried more weight than words.

"Tomorrow," she said again, and the line went dead.

Max stood on the bridge as the sun sank lower, painting the city in shades of fire and shadow. The phone felt heavy in his hand, a small rectangle of metal and glass that had just changed everything.

Twenty-four hours, Carter had said. 

He had less than that now. Less than a day to meet Elena in a cemetery and convince her to risk everything on the word of a man who'd built their entire relationship on lies.

Max pocketed the phone and started walking back toward the safe house, his pace quicker now, purposeful. The waiting was over. The real gamble was about to begin.

Behind him, the street musician's violin shifted into a new melody—something that sounded almost like hope, if you listened carefully enough. Max didn't look back, but he carried the sound with him through the darkening streets, a fragile counterpoint to the drumbeat of his pulse.

The cemetery. Tomorrow. Three o'clock.

He had one chance to get this right.

**Scene 4: Elena finally contacts Max thr...**

**Scene 4: Elena finally contacts Max through an encrypted message, asking to meet at a neutral location**

The message arrived at 4:47 PM on the third day—forty-seven hours past Max's self-imposed deadline for when he'd have to assume she'd chosen Viktor.

*Donaukanal. The bench near the Aspernbrücke. 7 PM. Come alone.*

Max read it three times, searching for subtext, for hidden meaning, for any indication of what awaited him. The encryption was sophisticated—not the simple app he'd given her, but something else entirely. She'd changed the game before even showing up.

He arrived twenty minutes early, approaching from the east along the canal path. The October dusk painted the water in shades of amber and slate, and the air carried the mineral smell of the Danube mixed with fallen leaves. A handful of joggers passed by, their breath visible in the cooling air. Max noted the sight lines, the exits, the places where a sniper might position themselves.

Professional paranoia. Or maybe justified caution. The line between the two had blurred considerably since he'd confessed everything to Elena.

He took up position on a bench fifty meters from the designated meeting spot, close enough to observe, far enough to react if this was a trap. A street musician was packing up his violin case nearby. Two students shared a joint under the Aspernbrücke, their laughter echoing off the concrete. Normal evening activity. Nothing that screamed ambush.

But Viktor's people were good. They wouldn't scream.

At 6:58, Elena appeared.

She came from the west, walking with the unhurried grace that had first caught his attention at the gallery. She wore dark jeans and a charcoal peacoat, her hair pulled back in a simple ponytail. No jewelry. No designer labels. She looked younger this way, more like the woman she might have been if Viktor Volkov had never entered her life.

Max watched her scan the area—a quick, efficient assessment that told him she'd been trained or had learned through necessity. She spotted him immediately, though he'd positioned himself carefully. A slight nod acknowledged his presence, but she continued to the designated bench and sat, crossing her legs and pulling out her phone as if waiting for a friend.

He gave it two more minutes, watching for tails, for anyone who showed too much interest. Then he stood and walked to her.

"You're cautious," she said without looking up from her phone. "That's good. I'd hate to think I was trusting my life to an amateur."

Max sat, leaving a respectful distance between them. "You changed the encryption."

"The app you gave me was adequate for what it was. But I needed to be sure this conversation stayed private." She finally looked at him, and her eyes were different—harder, more calculating. "You're not the only one with resources, Max. Or should I say Agent Monroe? Or is it something else entirely?"

The question landed like a blade between his ribs. "What did you find?"

"Enough." She pocketed her phone and turned to face him fully. "Maxwell James Monroe. Former CIA, now freelance. You've worked for at least three different intelligence agencies in the past two years, always on contract, never official. You specialize in financial crimes and Eastern European organized crime. You have no permanent address, no real relationships, and a reputation for being very, very good at what you do."

Max kept his expression neutral, but internally he was recalibrating everything. "That must have taken considerable effort to uncover."

"I have friends you don't know about. People who owe me favors that Viktor doesn't control." A ghost of a smile crossed her lips. "Did you think I survived five years with him by being helpless? By being just a pretty accessory?"

"I never thought that."

"Didn't you?" She tilted her head, studying him. "Your whole approach was based on saving me. The damsel in the tower, waiting for rescue."

"That's not—"

"I'm not angry about it," she interrupted. "It's sweet, actually. And it tells me something important about you." She looked out at the canal, where the last light was fading from the water. "You see people as more than assets. That's rare in your profession."

A jogger passed behind them, and both fell silent until he was out of earshot. The temperature was dropping, and Max could see Elena suppress a shiver.

"Why did you agree to meet?" he asked.

"Because despite the deception, despite the manipulation, I believe you were telling the truth about one thing." She met his eyes again. "You care what happens to me. Not just as a mission objective. As a person."

"Yes."

"That's either very professional or very dangerous."

"It's very real," Max said quietly.

Elena studied him for a long moment, and he could see her weighing his words, testing them against whatever criteria she'd developed for detecting lies. Finally, she nodded.

"I've spent the last two days thinking about what I want," she said. "Not what Viktor wants, not what you want. What I want." She pulled her coat tighter. "Do you know what I realized?"

"Tell me."

"I'm tired of being afraid. I'm tired of measuring every word, every gesture, every breath. I'm tired of being owned." Her voice was steady, but Max heard the steel beneath it. "I want to wake up in the morning without wondering if this is the day he decides I'm more trouble than I'm worth. I want to make choices that are mine."

"I can give you that."

"Can you?" She turned to face him fully. "Because I need you to understand something, Max. If I do this—if I help you get what you need from Viktor—I'm not trading one handler for another. I'm not going from his control to yours, or to whoever you're working for."

"That's not what I'm offering."

"Then what are you offering? Specifically."

Max took a breath, knowing that what he said next would determine everything. "Documentation. A new identity that will hold up under serious scrutiny. Financial resources—enough to start over wherever you want. And protection until you're clear."

"In exchange for?"

"Access to Viktor's records. The real ones, not the sanitized versions he shows his legitimate partners. Financial transactions, communications, anything that proves what he's really running."

Elena nodded slowly. "His safe. In the study."

"You know the combination?"

"I know where he keeps it written down. He's paranoid about forgetting it." She smiled without humor. "Ironic, isn't it? His paranoia creates vulnerabilities."

A cyclist passed, and they both watched until he disappeared around a bend in the path. The street musician was gone now, and the students had moved on. They were alone except for a few distant figures too far away to matter.

"There's something else," Elena said. "A condition."

"Name it."

She turned to look at him directly, and in the fading light, her eyes were luminous and fierce. "I need to know this is real. What's between us. Because if I'm going to risk everything—my life, my future, whatever small safety I've managed to carve out—I need to know it's not just another lie. Another manipulation."

Max felt something shift in his chest, a barrier he'd maintained for years cracking under the weight of her directness. Every instinct he'd honed, every rule he'd followed, screamed at him to hedge, to leave himself an exit.

Instead, he said, "It's real."

"How can you be sure?"

"Because I've been doing this for fifteen years, and I've never once broken protocol for someone. I've never compromised a mission, never let personal feelings interfere." He leaned forward, elbows on his knees. "Until you. I broke every rule in the book the moment I told you the truth instead of continuing the operation as planned."

"Maybe that was part of the plan."

"It wasn't." He looked at her. "My handler doesn't even know I've approached you yet. I was supposed to gather intelligence, build a case, and then extract you as a witness if necessary. I was supposed to keep you at arm's length, maintain the cover, play it safe."

"But you didn't."

"No." The admission felt like stepping off a cliff. "Because somewhere between the gallery and the café and all those conversations about art and life and everything else, I stopped seeing you as part of the mission. I started seeing you as someone I didn't want to lose."

Elena was quiet for a long moment, her expression unreadable. Then she reached out and took his hand—the first time she'd initiated contact since he'd revealed the truth.

"Okay," she said simply.

"Okay?"

"I'll help you. We'll do this together." She squeez

**Scene 5: Elena agrees to help Max acces...**

**Scene 5: Elena agrees to help Max access Viktor's safe**

The park had emptied as darkness settled over the city. Streetlamps flickered to life along the pathways, casting pools of amber light that didn't quite reach where Max and Elena sat. The temperature had dropped, and she pulled her coat tighter, though Max suspected it wasn't entirely from the cold.

She'd been silent for nearly ten minutes, staring at the fountain that had stopped running for the night. Her profile was sharp against the dying light, beautiful and unreachable. Max forced himself not to fill the silence, not to push. He'd laid everything out—the truth about who he was, what he needed, what he could offer in return. Now it was her move.

"I need to know something," Elena said finally, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Anything."

She turned to face him, and the vulnerability in her eyes made his chest tighten. "All of this—the gallery, the conversations, the way you looked at me—was any of it real? Or was I just another asset to be cultivated?"

Max had prepared for this question during the sleepless nights before he'd decided to approach her. He'd rehearsed careful answers that would reassure without committing, that would keep his options open while securing her cooperation. Every word of those rehearsed responses died in his throat.

"It started as an assignment," he said, meeting her gaze and holding it. "I was supposed to get close to you, gain your trust, find a way to access Viktor's inner circle. That was the plan."

Her expression hardened, and she started to stand.

"Wait." He caught her hand, felt her pulse racing beneath his fingers. "That's how it started. Not how it became."

Elena remained poised between staying and leaving, her hand still in his.

"I don't know when it changed," Max continued, the words coming faster now, rougher. "Maybe it was that first conversation about Rothko, the way your whole face lit up when you talked about color fields and emotional resonance. Maybe it was watching you handle Viktor's associates at that dinner party—how you could be gracious and charming while I saw the steel underneath. Or maybe it was simpler than that. Maybe it was just... you."

"Pretty words," she said, but she didn't pull away. "You're trained for this, aren't you? Knowing exactly what to say to make someone feel—"

"I'm breaking every protocol by even having this conversation." Max stood, still holding her hand, close enough now that he could smell her perfume mixing with the scent of autumn leaves. "I should have recruited you through official channels. Should have kept emotional distance. Should have maintained my cover regardless of the outcome. Instead, I'm standing here telling you the truth because the thought of lying to you anymore makes me sick."

A car passed on the street beyond the park, its headlights briefly illuminating them before plunging them back into shadow.

"I could go to Viktor right now," Elena said. "Tell him everything. You'd be dead by morning."

"Yes."

"You're trusting me with your life."

"I already was. The moment I fell for you, I was compromised." Max released her hand, giving her the choice. "I'm not asking you to trust me because of what I can offer you—the new identity, the safe passage, all of that. I'm asking you to trust that what we have is real. That I see you, Elena. Not Viktor's wife, not an access point, not a mission objective. You."

She wrapped her arms around herself, and for a moment Max thought he'd lost her. Then she laughed—a short, sharp sound without much humor in it.

"Do you know how long it's been since someone saw me as just... me? Not as a possession, not as a trophy, not as a mistake that needs to be managed?" Her eyes glistened in the lamplight. "Five years, Max. Five years of being invisible while being constantly watched."

"You're not invisible to me."

"No," she agreed quietly. "I'm not, am I?"

The silence stretched between them, but it felt different now. Less like a chasm and more like a bridge being carefully constructed.

"I'll help you," Elena said finally. "I'll get you access to Viktor's safe."

Relief flooded through him, but he kept his expression neutral. "Thank you. We'll need to—"

"I'm not finished." She stepped closer, close enough that he could see the gold flecks in her brown eyes. "I have one condition."

"Name it."

"Promise me." Her voice was steady now, certain. "Promise me that this—us—is real. Not the mission, not the operation, not whatever your superiors think is happening. Promise me that when this is over, when I'm safe and Viktor is in prison or dead or whatever happens to him, you won't disappear. That I won't just be another successfully completed assignment that you file away and forget about."

Max knew what he should say. He should equivocate, should leave himself an out, should maintain enough professional distance to do his job. Hammond's voice echoed in his mind: *Never make a promise you can't keep. Never let it get personal.*

He thought about Elena's hand in his, about the way she'd looked at him in the gallery, about the risk she was taking by trusting him. He thought about the five years she'd spent being invisible, being trapped, being afraid.

Then he stopped thinking and let himself feel.

"I promise," Max said, and meant it with every fiber of his being. "This is real. You're real to me. And when this is over, I'm not going anywhere unless you want me gone."

Elena searched his face for a long moment, and whatever she saw there must have satisfied her because she nodded slowly. "Okay. Then let's talk about how we're going to do this."

She sat back down on the bench, and Max joined her, close enough that their shoulders touched. The contact felt electric, dangerous, necessary.

"Viktor keeps his most sensitive documents in a safe in his study," Elena began, her voice taking on a businesslike tone even as her hand found his in the darkness. "He changes the combination monthly, but I know where he keeps the written backup. He's paranoid about forgetting it."

"When can you access it?"

"Thursday night. He's flying to Moscow for meetings. He'll be gone for three days."

"That's soon."

"Is that a problem?" She glanced at him, and he saw the fear beneath her composure.

"No. It's perfect." Max squeezed her hand. "I'll need to set up surveillance, prepare extraction protocols, coordinate with my team—"

"Your team knows about me?"

"Not everything. Not about us." He turned to face her fully. "Hammond—my handler—knows I've made contact with you. He doesn't know how deep this goes."

"Will he try to stop it? Us?"

"Probably. If he knew." Max smiled grimly. "Which is why he's not going to know until it's too late to matter."

Elena leaned her head against his shoulder, a gesture so simple and trusting that it nearly broke him. "I'm terrified," she whispered.

"Me too."

"But you do this all the time. You're trained for it."

"I'm not trained for this." Max pressed his lips to her hair. "I'm not trained for feeling like my heart's going to explode every time I think about something happening to you. I'm not trained for being willing to throw away my entire career to keep you safe."

She lifted her head, and in the amber lamplight, her smile was small but genuine. "We're both breaking all our own rules, aren't we?"

"Spectacularly."

A cool breeze rustled through the trees, carrying the scent of rain. In the distance, thunder rumbled.

"We should go," Elena said, though she didn't move. "Viktor will expect me home soon."

"Two more minutes." Max pulled her closer, memorizing the feel of her against him, the rhythm of her breathing, the way she fit perfectly in the circle of his arms. "Just two more minutes where we're not planning operations or calculating risks. Where we're just... us."

Elena nodded against his chest. "Just us," she echoed.

They sat in the gathering darkness as the first drops of rain began to fall, two people who'd found each other in the worst possible circumstances, making promises they weren't sure they could keep but knowing they had to try.

When they finally stood to leave, walking toward separate cars parked on opposite sides of the park, Max watched her go and felt the weight of what they were about to do settle over him like a physical thing. He'd crossed a line tonight that he could never uncross. He'd made a promise that could cost him everything.

But as Elena paused at her

**Scene 6: With their pact sealed, Max an...**

# **Scene 6: With their pact sealed, Max and Elena begin sketching out a plan**

The interior of Elena's Mercedes smelled of leather and her perfume—something subtle with notes of jasmine that Max had come to associate with danger and desire in equal measure. Rain drummed against the roof, creating a cocoon of white noise that insulated them from the world outside. They'd parked in an industrial area near the old tobacco factory, where the surveillance cameras had been broken for months and no one asked questions.

Elena had killed the engine ten minutes ago, but neither of them had moved to leave.

Max spread a hand-drawn sketch across the center console, the paper crinkling in the confined space. "The reception starts at eight. Viktor will be greeting the ambassador and his entourage in the main salon here." He tapped the drawing. "That gives us a window, but not a large one."

Elena leaned closer, studying the layout she knew by heart but was seeing now through different eyes. The scent of her shampoo mixed with the rain-dampened air. "The safe is in his study on the second floor. East wing, third door on the right." Her finger traced the path. "But there are cameras in the hallway."

"Can you disable them?"

"Not without triggering an alert." She bit her lower lip, a gesture Max had learned meant she was thinking through a problem. "But the system has a scheduled maintenance reboot every Thursday at nine-fifteen. It's down for exactly four minutes."

Max felt a surge of adrenaline. "The reception is Thursday."

"I know." She met his eyes, and in the dim light filtering through the rain-streaked windows, he saw both fear and determination. "That's why I chose to tell you yes today. If we're going to do this, it has to be this week. Viktor leaves for Moscow on Saturday, and after that..." She didn't finish the sentence.

After that, she'd be going with him. Back into the heart of his world, where Max couldn't follow.

He pushed the thought away and focused on the sketch. "Four minutes isn't much time. I'll need to know the safe's make and model, any security features beyond the standard combination."

"It's a Hartmann Tresore. Biometric scanner and a six-digit code that Viktor changes monthly." She paused, her breath fogging slightly against the window she'd been staring through. "But he keeps a backup override code written down. He thinks I don't know about it."

"Where?"

"In his desk drawer. The one with the false bottom." A bitter smile crossed her lips. "Men like Viktor always think they're cleverer than everyone else. It never occurs to them that the people they underestimate might be watching."

Max studied her profile—the elegant line of her jaw, the tension in her shoulders, the way her hands gripped the steering wheel even though they weren't moving. "How long have you been planning this?"

She turned to face him, and the vulnerability in her expression made his chest tighten. "Planning what? Escape? Or falling for someone who might actually help me do it?" 

The question hung between them like the rain suspended in the air outside, each droplet catching the amber glow of distant streetlights.

"Elena—"

"I need to know something, Max." She shifted in her seat, turning her body toward him fully. "When we get what you need, when I give you access to Viktor's files and his secrets and everything that could bring him down—what happens to me then? Do I become evidence? A witness to be relocated and debriefed and filed away?"

Max set the sketch aside and took her hand. Her fingers were cold despite the warmth of the car. "You become free. Whatever that means to you."

"And you?"

He should lie. Every protocol, every rule of tradecraft, every lesson learned in a career built on deception screamed at him to give her the answer that would keep her compliant and cooperative. Instead, he found himself saying, "I don't know. I've never done this before."

"Broken the rules?"

"Meant it when I broke them."

Elena's eyes searched his face, looking for cracks in the foundation of his honesty. Whatever she found there must have satisfied her, because she squeezed his hand and returned her attention to the sketch. "The study has two entrances. The main door from the hallway, and a service door that connects to the library. Viktor never uses it—he had it installed for the architects' plans but never furnished the library properly."

"Is it locked?"

"From the inside, yes. But I have a key." She reached into her purse and produced a small brass key that caught the light. "I had a copy made three months ago. I told myself it was just in case, but I think part of me always knew I'd need it for something like this."

Max took the key, feeling its weight in his palm. Such a small thing to represent such an enormous risk. "During the reception, you'll need to keep Viktor occupied. Can you do that without raising suspicion?"

"I've been keeping Viktor occupied for two years without raising suspicion about what I really think of him." The hardness in her voice could have cut glass. "I can manage one more night."

They spent the next twenty minutes going over details—guard rotations, guest lists, potential complications. Elena knew the household routines with the precision of someone who'd been studying them for exactly this purpose, and Max found himself impressed by her operational awareness. She would have made a good field agent in another life.

"What are we looking for specifically?" Elena asked, pulling a small notebook from her glove compartment. "If we only have four minutes, we can't waste time sorting through everything."

"Financial records. Anything linking Viktor to the arms deals in Syria. Communications with his contacts in the Kremlin." Max paused, considering how much to tell her. "And a list. Names of people in Western governments who've been taking his money."

Elena's pen stilled on the paper. "That's what this is really about, isn't it? Not just Viktor. He's a stepping stone to something bigger."

"Yes."

She appreciated the honesty, he could tell. No deflection, no sugar-coating. Just the truth, raw and simple.

"How many names are on this list?"

"We don't know. Could be five, could be fifty." Max watched her process this information, saw the moment she understood the full scope of what they were attempting. "If we can get that list, Elena, it's not just about taking down Viktor. It's about exposing a network that's been corrupting governments for years."

"And if we fail?"

"Then we both disappear. Different ways, probably, but equally permanent."

The rain intensified, hammering against the roof like fingers drumming impatiently. Elena wrote something in her notebook, then tore out the page and handed it to Max. "The override code. He changed it last week—I watched him enter it through the reflection in the window glass."

Max looked at the six digits: 281947. "What do they mean?"

"The date he first killed someone." Elena's voice was flat, emotionless. "He told me once when he was drunk. August 28th, 1947. He was sixteen years old, during the Soviet occupation. He thinks it makes him a patriot. I think it makes him a monster who never grew beyond that scared boy with blood on his hands."

Max folded the paper and tucked it into his wallet. "You're sure about this? Once we start, there's no turning back."

Elena reached out and touched his face, her fingers cool against his cheek. "I've been trapped in a life I didn't choose for longer than I can remember. At least this way, I'm choosing something. Even if it's dangerous, even if it's terrifying—it's mine."

He turned his head and kissed her palm, a gesture that felt both intimate and like a promise. "Thursday night, then. The reception starts at eight, the camera reboot happens at nine-fifteen. I'll enter through the service door at nine-fourteen."

"I'll make sure it's unlocked by nine." Elena withdrew her hand and started the engine, the Mercedes purring to life. "Where should I drop you?"

"Two blocks from here. I'll walk the rest."

As she pulled out of the industrial lot, Max memorized the route she took, noting cameras and sight lines out of habit. The rain had eased to a drizzle, turning the city into a watercolor painting of blurred lights and indistinct shapes.

Elena stopped at a corner where a broken streetlight created a pool of shadow. Before Max could open the door, she grabbed his arm.

"Max?"

He turned back to her.

"After this is over, after we have what we need and I'm free—" She hesitated, and for a moment she looked impossibly young despite everything she'd endured. "
