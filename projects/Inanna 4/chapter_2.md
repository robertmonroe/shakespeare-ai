## Chapter 2: Forbidden Compassion

### Scene 1: The Weight of Stolen Memory

The neural archive chamber hummed with a frequency just below conscious perception. Inanna stood before the crystalline interface, fingers hovering above the luminescent surface.

*You shouldn't be here.*

But she was out of options. One cycle to save humanity, and the evidence she needed was locked behind protocols she didn't have clearance to breach.

She initiated the connection anyway.

The memory surged forward before she could stop it—

---

*Three millennia ago. A jungle settlement. A boy named Mira.*

*He'd offered her bread. Coarse, dark, almost inedible. She'd eaten it anyway, seated cross-legged in the dust while he spoke of dreams and stars and a wild creature called Tarzan who lived among the apes.*

*"Will you come back?" he'd asked when she rose to leave.*

*"I don't know."*

*She never saw him again. The settlement was erased within three cycles. A mining accident, the official report claimed.*

*But she remembered his smile. His fearlessness. His simple, devastating kindness.*

---

The memory faded. Inanna's cheeks were wet.

*Focus.*

She ripped open the restricted genetic archives, ignoring access protocols. The Tiamat Protocol. Atmospheric dispersion schedules. Target demographics.

It was worse than she'd feared.

Not just the Cleansing—a complete species termination. Failsafes within failsafes. If the genetic cascade didn't kill them, the floods would. If the floods failed, the seeded predators would finish the job.

They intended to leave *nothing*.

She copied everything, encrypting it with algorithms only her mother would recognize. Then she left a coded message for Enki in the environmental control logs—a seemingly random data sequence that would tell him everything.

Alarms began to wail.

*Time to move.*

### Scene 2: Flight Through the Arteries

Inanna yanked up the maintenance schedule as security protocols triggered throughout the station. The archive's access logs would be the first place they'd check. Her entry point was compromised.

She abandoned the main corridors and dove into a service passage—a narrow tube meant for automated cargo drones. The space was cramped, poorly lit, humming with the constant thrum of transported materials.

A cargo pod approached. She pressed herself flat against the wall as it screamed past, close enough to ruffle her hair.

*There.*

The next pod was thirty seconds out. She had one chance.

When it arrived, she grabbed the external handrail and swung herself onto the chassis, locking her legs around a support strut. The pod rocketed forward, carrying her through the station's guts at terrifying speed.

Behind her, the alarms grew louder.

*Faster*, she urged. *Faster.*

### Scene 3: The Observation Deck

The restricted docking bay was chaos when she arrived—techs running diagnostics, security sweeping for the archive breach. Inanna slipped through in a stolen maintenance uniform, her auburn hair tucked beneath a cap, her distinctive features hidden in shadow.

A transport shuttle sat in Bay Seventeen. Diplomatic vessel. Heading to the *Throne of Heaven* for routine crew rotation.

She didn't need to reach Enlil's station. She just needed to get close enough to the planet to steal a recon pod.

The crew was boarding. Four Igigi officers, two administrators, one pilot.

She merged with a group of maintenance workers crossing toward a neighboring bay. At the last moment, she split off, ducking behind a cargo stack. The boarding ramp was twenty meters away.

"Hey!" A guard's voice. "You there!"

Inanna didn't look back. She walked faster, angling toward the ramp.

"Stop!"

She ran.

The ramp was ahead. Ten meters. Five. She could hear boots pounding behind her, shouts of alarm. A stun pulse crackled past her ear, close enough to feel the heat.

She dove through the hatch and slammed her palm against the emergency seal. The door irised shut behind her.

"What the—" The pilot spun in his seat.

Inanna's hand found the neural disruptor at her hip. "Change of plans. We're going to Earth."

### Scene 4: Seeds of a Desperate Plan

The shuttle dropped toward the blue-green sphere, alarms blaring in the cockpit. The pilot—bound and unconscious—slumped in the co-pilot's seat.

Inanna's fingers flew across the controls, disabling tracking beacons, scrambling identification codes. It wouldn't buy her much time, but she didn't need much.

Just enough to reach the surface.

Just enough to find the wild man her mother had spoken of—the one the primitives called Tarzan.

*The jungle remembers*, Antu had said. *Seek the forgotten places.*

The coordinates burned in her memory: 21°18′N 72°50′E. Somewhere in the vast green wilderness of the African interior. A place the Anunnaki had never bothered to monitor because nothing of value grew there.

Nothing except freedom.

The shuttle shuddered as it hit the upper atmosphere. Warning lights screamed. The hull temperature spiked.

Inanna gripped the controls and aimed for the jungle.

Behind her, she knew, pursuit was already launching.

### Scene 5: Whispers in the Jungle

The shuttle crashed in a river delta, throwing up a geyser of mud and vegetation.

Inanna crawled from the wreckage, coughing smoke, her ceremonial robes torn and singed. The jungle pressed in from all sides—impossibly green, impossibly *alive*, a riot of sounds and scents that overwhelmed her carefully calibrated senses.

*Planet-bound emergency protocols*, her interface suggested. *Seek extraction point. Signal for recovery.*

She dismissed it. There would be no recovery. Not for her.

She had seventy-two hours before the Cleansing began. Seventy-two hours to find a wild man raised by apes and convince him that the gods were coming to destroy his world.

The jungle watched her with a thousand hidden eyes.

Inanna took a breath, squared her shoulders, and began to walk.

Somewhere in the green darkness ahead, a creature that was neither man nor ape moved through the canopy, drawn by the smoke of her crash like a moth to flame.

Their paths were about to collide.

And nothing would ever be the same.
