    },
    "worldbuilding": {
        "geography": "The story unfolds primarily across two distinct landscapes: rural Iowa and urban Memphis, Tennessee. Iowa, in the context of Percy's farm, is characterized by gently rolling hills, fertile farmland dominated by corn and soybean fields, and scattered pockets of deciduous forests. The climate is continental, with hot, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. Mud, particularly around the pig farm, is a constant presence, reflecting the frequent rainfall and the nature of livestock farming. Memphis, conversely, is a bustling city situated on the banks of the Mississippi River. The landscape is flatter, with urban sprawl extending outwards from the city center. The climate is subtropical, with hot, humid summers and mild winters. The river itself is a powerful geographic force, shaping the city's history and economy. The contrast between the open spaces of Iowa and the concrete jungle of Memphis is a key element of Percy's journey, symbolizing his transition from rural obscurity to urban fame (or infamy). Beyond the specific locations detailed later, the Mississippi River plays a significant role, representing escape and opportunity. It's the literal waterway Percy needs to cross to reach Memphis and a symbolic divide between his old life and his potential future. The surrounding areas of Memphis, including rural communities and small towns, are depicted as places where Elvis's influence is deeply ingrained, permeating everything from diner jukeboxes to local festivals.",
        "culture_and_society": "In rural Iowa, traditional farming practices and values of hard work, community, and a deep connection to the land are prevalent. Pig farming is not just a business but a way of life for many families. In Memphis, the dominant cultural force is the legacy of Elvis Presley. The city is saturated with Elvis-themed attractions, impersonators, and memorabilia. There's a strong sense of community among Elvis fans, who gather for concerts, festivals, and pilgrimages to Graceland. Southern hospitality is also a notable characteristic of Memphis culture. The story also touches on the culture of animal rights activism, particularly concerning the ethical treatment of livestock. Iowa society is structured around family farms, with a clear hierarchy based on land ownership and agricultural expertise. In Memphis, society is more diverse, with a blend of ethnicities, economic backgrounds, and cultural influences. The Elvis impersonator community has its own informal social structure, with tiers based on talent, popularity, and longevity in the business. Runaway teens, like Daisy, often form their own social groups based on shared experiences and mutual support. The economic divide in both locations is also a subtle factor, highlighting the struggles of those who are less fortunate.",
        "history": "- **Pre-2020s (Fictional):** Advances in genetic engineering lead to the creation of genetically modified livestock with enhanced traits, including enhanced vocal capabilities (though not necessarily intended for singing). The ethical implications of this technology are debated.\n- **Early 2020s:** Percy is born on a pig farm in Iowa. He displays an unusual talent for mimicking Elvis Presley's singing voice. He begins to question his destiny as bacon.\n- **Mid 2020s:** Percy escapes the farm and makes his way to Memphis, encountering Daisy along the way.\n- **Late 2020s:** Percy, as \"The Swine-King,\" rises to fame within the Elvis impersonator circuit. The farm owner begins his pursuit.\n- **Future (Potential):** A showdown between Percy, the farm owner, and the ethical implications of genetic engineering. The fate of genetically modified livestock becomes a matter of public debate. The key turning point is Percy's escape from the farm. This act of defiance sets him on his journey and shapes the rest of the narrative. Another turning point is his first performance as \"The Swine-King,\" which marks his entry into the world of Elvis impersonation and his newfound fame. The farm owner's decision to pursue Percy also represents a significant shift, transforming the story from a personal quest into a high-stakes chase.",
        "rules_and_laws": "The story operates within the framework of the United States legal system. Animal cruelty laws are relevant, particularly concerning the treatment of livestock. Property rights are a key issue, as the farm owner claims ownership of Percy. The legality of genetic engineering and the rights of genetically modified animals are subtly explored, although not explicitly addressed in court. Child protection laws are also relevant concerning Daisy's situation as a runaway teen. Local and state governments oversee law enforcement in Iowa and Tennessee. Federal regulations concerning agriculture and genetic engineering also play a role. The farm owner likely operates under permits and licenses issued by these governing bodies. Local animal shelters and social services agencies would be involved in cases of animal cruelty or child endangerment. Law enforcement officers, including local police and state troopers, are responsible for enforcing the law. Animal control officers would investigate reports of animal cruelty. Social workers would be involved in Daisy's case. The effectiveness of law enforcement is sometimes questioned, particularly in rural areas where resources may be limited.",
        "technology_level": "Genetic engineering is the most prominent technology, responsible for Percy's existence. Modern agricultural technology is also present on the farm, including automated feeding systems and climate control. Communication technology, such as smartphones and the internet, plays a role in Percy's rise to fame and the farm owner's ability to track him down. The story also features stage technology used in the Elvis impersonator performances, including sound systems, lighting, and special effects. Genetic engineering has created both opportunities and ethical dilemmas. It has increased agricultural productivity but also raised concerns about animal welfare and the long-term consequences of modifying the natural world. Communication technology has made it easier for individuals to connect and share their talents, but it has also increased the risk of privacy violations and online harassment. The accessibility of these technologies influences both Percy's journey and the conflicts he faces.",
        "magic_system": "Not applicable. The story operates within a realistic, albeit slightly heightened, version of the modern world.",
        "key_locations": "The farm is a large, industrial-scale operation, typical of modern pig farming. It's a sterile and often unpleasant environment, with rows of pens and the constant stench of manure. The farm represents Percy's confinement and lack of freedom. The owner's house is a comfortable but modest dwelling, reflecting his success as a farmer. Memphis is a vibrant and culturally rich city, with a strong connection to music, history, and Southern traditions. Graceland, Elvis Presley's mansion, is a major landmark and pilgrimage site for fans from around the world. Beale Street is a historic street known for its blues clubs and live music. The city also has a darker side, with poverty, crime, and social inequality. The Mississippi Riverfront is a scenic area with parks and walking trails. These venues range from small-town bars to large concert halls. They are often decorated with Elvis memorabilia and filled with enthusiastic fans. The backstage areas are often chaotic and competitive, with impersonators vying for attention and opportunities. These locations showcase both the glamour and the challenges of the Elvis impersonator lifestyle.",
        "important_organizations": "",
        "flora_and_fauna": "In Iowa, corn and soybean fields dominate the landscape, along with patches of oak and maple forests. In Memphis, urban flora includes trees like magnolias, crape myrtles, and live oaks. The Mississippi River supports a variety of aquatic plants. Genetically modified crops are also a factor, influencing the ecosystem around the pig farm. Pigs are the dominant animal species on the farm, raised for meat production. Other animals found in Iowa include deer, squirrels, birds, and insects. In Memphis, common urban animals include dogs, cats, birds, squirrels, and rodents. The Mississippi River is home to fish, turtles, and other aquatic creatures. Percy, as a genetically modified pig, represents a unique and controversial element of the local fauna.",
        "languages": "English is the primary language spoken in both Iowa and Memphis. Southern dialects are prevalent in Memphis, adding a distinct flavor to the local culture. A small percentage of the population may speak other languages, such as Spanish, reflecting the diversity of the region. Standard American English with some regional variations in vocabulary and pronunciation.",
        "religions_and_beliefs": "Christianity is the dominant religion in both Iowa and Memphis, with a variety of denominations represented. Religious values often influence people's views on ethical issues, such as animal welfare and genetic engineering. Beyond formal religion, many people in the story hold strong beliefs about the importance of family, community, and hard work. They also value freedom, individuality, and the pursuit of dreams. The Elvis Presley fandom can be seen as a quasi-religious phenomenon, with fans exhibiting devotion and reverence for the King.",
        "economy": "The Iowa pig farm operates within the agricultural commodity market, trading pigs for meat production. Memphis is a major transportation and distribution hub, with a diverse economy that includes tourism, manufacturing, and healthcare. Elvis Presley's legacy contributes significantly to the city's tourism revenue. The United States dollar is the currency used in both Iowa and Memphis. Iowa's primary resource is fertile farmland, which supports a thriving agricultural industry. Memphis benefits from its location on the Mississippi River, which provides access to transportation and trade. The city's cultural heritage and musical history are also valuable resources. Both Iowa and Memphis operate within a capitalist economic system, with free markets and private ownership. However, government regulations and social safety nets play a role in moderating the excesses of capitalism.",
        "conflicts": "Historical conflicts related to the Civil Rights Movement are subtly referenced in the context of Memphis. The economic struggles of rural communities and the decline of family farms are also underlying conflicts. The central conflict is Percy's struggle for freedom and his attempt to escape his predetermined fate as bacon. The farm owner's pursuit of Percy represents another conflict, driven by economic interests and a sense of ownership. The ethical debate surrounding genetic engineering and animal welfare is an ongoing conflict, raising questions about the role of humans in manipulating the natural world. Daisy's situation as a runaway teen also represents a conflict, as she navigates the challenges of poverty, homelessness, and social isolation. Also, the internal conflict of Percy between achieving his dreams and not letting down Daisy or his new found community.",
