## Chapter 1: The Pig, the City, and the Shy Comedian

**Scene 1: Johnny nervously works his shift at Tony's Deli**

The aroma of cured meats, stale bread, and slightly too-strong mustard hung thick in the air of Tony's Deli, clinging to Johnny like a second skin. He stood behind the counter, meticulously arranging slices of provolone on a sesame seed roll, his hands moving with a practiced, almost robotic efficiency. Outside, the city buzzed – honking taxis, chattering crowds, the rhythmic thump of a distant bass – but inside, Johnny was trapped in a beige-tiled prison of cold cuts and customer service.

He glanced at the clock above the register. 4:17 PM. Only another hour and forty-three minutes until freedom. He imagined himself on a stage, bathed in a spotlight, microphone in hand. "What do you call a lazy kangaroo?" he'd ask, his voice booming with confidence. "Pouch potato!" The imaginary crowd roared with laughter.

"Johnny! You zoning out again?" Tony's voice, gravelly and laced with a perpetual New York accent, snapped him back to reality. Tony, a barrel-chested man with a perpetual five o'clock shadow, gestured impatiently with a salami the size of Johnny's forearm. "Mrs. Henderson's been waiting for her usual for five minutes."

Johnny flushed. "Sorry, Tony." He plastered on a smile, a practiced maneuver that never quite reached his eyes. "Be right with you, Mrs. Henderson."

Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose tightly permed hair seemed to defy gravity, peered over her spectacles. "Took you long enough, young man. I'm on a schedule, you know."

"Of course, Mrs. Henderson. One turkey on rye, light mayo, extra pickles?" Johnny recited, his voice monotone. He hated this part. The rote memorization, the forced pleasantries, the stifling predictability of it all. He wanted to be crafting jokes, not crafting sandwiches.

As he assembled Mrs. Henderson's order, his mind drifted again. He pictured himself killing it at the open mic night at the Laugh Lounge. His jokes, sharp and witty observations about the absurdity of city life, landing perfectly. He'd be a star. A real comedian.

"And don't be skimpy with the pickles this time," Mrs. Henderson barked, shattering his daydream.

Johnny sighed internally. "Yes, ma'am." He layered on the pickles, trying to ignore the dull ache in his chest. It wasn't just the pickles; it was everything. The job, his shyness, the fear of failure. He longed to be brave, to be funny, to be… noticed.

He handed Mrs. Henderson her sandwich. "That'll be $6.75."

She counted out the money slowly, each coin landing with a sharp clink on the counter. "You know, you should smile more, young man. It's good for business."

Johnny forced another smile, this one even more strained than the last. "I'll keep that in mind, Mrs. Henderson."

She harrumphed and shuffled away, leaving Johnny feeling deflated. He watched her disappear out the door, then turned back to the endless rows of salami, ham, and roast beef. The clock ticked on. 4:23 PM. He leaned against the counter, the cool tile a small comfort against the burning frustration in his gut. He needed a change. He needed a miracle. He needed…something.

He just didn't know what. The bell above the door jingled, announcing another customer. Johnny braced himself, forcing himself to breathe. He'd make this sandwich, try to crack a joke (even if only in his head), and get through the next hour and thirty-seven minutes. Then, maybe, just maybe, he could escape.

**Scene 2: On his walk home from the deli...**

The aroma of stale bagels and something vaguely fishy clung to Johnny as he stepped out of Manny's Deli. He scrubbed his hands on his jeans, trying to erase the smell, but it lingered like a bad punchline he couldn’t quite nail. He was already halfway home, weaving between tourists snapping photos of gargoyles and delivery guys balancing precarious towers of pizza boxes, before he felt brave enough to try it again.

“Why don’t scientists trust atoms?” He muttered, almost tripping over a crack in the sidewalk. The rumble of a passing bus threatened to drown him out entirely. He cleared his throat. “Because they make up everything!”

He cringed. It sounded flat, lifeless. Even to him, alone, on a bustling city sidewalk.

He kicked a dented soda can, sending it skittering down the pavement. *Clang. Clang. Clang.* The sound echoed his own internal monologue – a repetitive cycle of self-doubt.

*Make up everything…* Honestly, he thought, pulling his worn backpack tighter against his shoulders, he probably *was* making things up. He was making up that he was funny. Making up that he could actually stand on a stage in front of strangers and make them laugh. Making up that he was anything other than…well, Johnny. The shy kid from apartment 3B who spent more time cleaning meat slicers than crafting killer jokes.

The afternoon sun beat down, turning the sidewalk into a shimmering mirage. A hot dog vendor on the corner shouted about his "World Famous Franks," the aroma of grilled onions momentarily overpowering the lingering deli scent. Johnny avoided eye contact, his face burning. Even ordering a hot dog felt like a performance he wasn't ready for.

He tried the joke again, this time injecting it with what he hoped was a sardonic tone. "Scientists and atoms… they *make up* everything. Get it? *Everything?*" He punctuated the imaginary punchline with a weak little finger-gun gesture.

Nothing. Still flat. Still lifeless.

He sighed, the sound getting lost in the cacophony of the city. Maybe his parents were right. Maybe he should just focus on his grades and forget this whole comedy thing. Maybe he was destined to slice salami for the rest of his life.

He scowled, the thought leaving a bitter taste in his mouth, worse than the day-old coffee Manny always brewed. He needed something, anything, to break free from this cycle. He needed a sign. He needed…

He rounded the corner onto Bleecker Street, and that's when he saw it. Or rather, *him*. Rooted to the spot, Johnny blinked, sure the heat was getting to him. Standing amidst the lunchtime crowd, weaving precariously between messenger bikes and oblivious pedestrians, was a pig. A large, pink, undeniably dancing pig. And something about the sight, ridiculous as it was, sparked a flicker of… something.

**Scene 3: Johnny sees a crowd gathered a...**

The aroma of exhaust fumes and sizzling street meat usually hit Johnny first as he rounded the corner onto Elm Street, but today it was different. A dense knot of people blocked his usual route, murmurs rippling through the air like a sudden gust of wind. Curiosity, a rare visitor in his otherwise predictable existence, tugged him forward. He clutched his deli apron, the grease stains a familiar comfort, and squeezed through the throng.

“Excuse me… sorry… coming through…” he mumbled, sidestepping a woman with a stroller and narrowly avoiding a collision with a teenager sporting neon green headphones.

Finally, he broke free into the open space in the center of the crowd. And what he saw stole the air right out of his lungs.

A pig.

A *pig* was dancing.

Not just any pig, mind you. This was a magnificent specimen, a rosy-pink creature with a surprising spring in its trotters. A boombox, perched precariously on a milk crate next to a busker strumming a slightly off-key rendition of "Livin' on a Prayer," blasted a raucous Latin beat. And the pig? It was *grooving*.

Arnie – though Johnny didn’t know his name yet – shuffled his hefty frame from side to side, his curly tail swishing with surprising rhythm. He’d lift a trotter, tap it twice on the pavement, then lower it with a delicate flourish. At one point, he even attempted a little spin, though it ended with him nearly losing his balance and grunting in what sounded suspiciously like amusement.

The busker, a skinny guy with a handlebar mustache and a perpetually surprised expression, seemed just as mesmerized as everyone else. His fingers fumbled over the guitar strings, occasionally hitting a wrong note, but he kept strumming, caught in the bizarre spectacle. Coins clinked into his open guitar case, likely more for the pig than the music.

Johnny watched, transfixed. He’d seen a lot of strange things in the city – pigeons wearing tiny hats, a mime who only mimed interpretive dance based on traffic signals, a man who walked around dressed as a giant pickle – but this… this was something else entirely.

A little girl in a pink dress giggled, clapping her hands in delight. “He’s so good!” she squealed.

Arnie, seemingly encouraged by the applause, launched into a more elaborate sequence. He dipped his head, swung his rear end, and even managed a little hop, all perfectly in sync with the music. Johnny could see flecks of sweat glistening on his snout, but his eyes, surprisingly intelligent and bright, sparkled with pure joy.

A wave of unexpected elation washed over Johnny. He hadn't felt this genuinely amused in… well, he couldn’t remember when. He found himself grinning, the corners of his mouth twitching upward despite his best efforts to remain composed. For a moment, the weight of his anxieties, the pressure to be funny, the fear of failure, seemed to evaporate.

The song ended abruptly, the silence punctuated only by the busker clearing his throat nervously. Arnie, panting slightly, stood center stage, awaiting the next song. He nudged the milk crate with his snout, as if to say, "More music, please!"

As the busker fumbled with his boombox, Johnny felt a strange compulsion. He had to know more. He had to talk to this pig.

**Scene 4: Arnie stops dancing and collap...**

The last notes of the imaginary trumpet faded. Arnie’s rhythmic snorts subsided, replaced by ragged, wheezing breaths. He staggered, his little hooves skittering on the gritty pavement, and then, with a dramatic flourish worthy of a seasoned performer, he collapsed in a heap. All four legs stuck straight out, his pink belly exposed to the indifferent sky. He looked…defeated.

Johnny, still buzzing from the sheer absurdity and unexpected joy of the impromptu performance, wasn’t sure what to do. He knelt beside Arnie. “Hey, buddy, you okay?” he asked, his voice laced with concern. He gently nudged the pig with his toe.

Suddenly, a voice, hoarse and panicked, ripped through the humid afternoon air. “Arnold! Arnold, where are you?!”

Arnie’s head shot up. His eyes, previously glazed with exhaustion, darted around with frantic energy. The happy-go-lucky aura vanished, replaced by pure, unadulterated panic.

“Arnold!” The voice was closer now, laced with exasperation and a hint of desperation. The sound of hurried footsteps echoed on the sidewalk.

Arnie squealed, a high-pitched sound that grated on Johnny’s ears. He scrambled to his feet, wobbling precariously. He didn't look at Johnny, his gaze fixed on something beyond. Then, with a speed that belied his size, he lurched forward and grabbed Johnny’s leg with his snout.

It wasn’t a bite, exactly. More like a desperate, clinging grab. Arnie burrowed behind Johnny’s skinny jeans, using him as a fleshy, inadequate shield. He trembled violently, his damp snout leaving a wet patch on Johnny's leg. The smell of manure and something vaguely floral, like cheap air freshener, wafted up.

A man, red-faced and sweating, burst around the corner. He wore overalls stained with mud and carried a long, hooked stick. "Arnold! There you are, you little rascal!" He stopped short, his eyes widening as he took in the scene: Johnny, awkwardly frozen, and a terrified pig hiding behind him.

"Uh… hi," Johnny stammered, his voice barely a whisper. He felt a strange surge of protectiveness towards the trembling pig clinging to his leg. He didn't understand why, but he couldn't bring himself to simply hand Arnie over. He felt like he was betraying something…something hopeful, something connected to that crazy, beautiful dance.

The farmer squinted at Johnny. “You seen my pig? Arnold? He’s… a bit of a wanderer.” He gestured vaguely with the stick. “And a dancer, apparently,” he added, a hint of amusement flickering across his stern face.

**Scene 5: The farmer gives up the search...**

The farmer’s shouts faded, replaced by the distant wail of a siren and the rhythmic thump of a basketball from a nearby park. Johnny, heart still hammering against his ribs, cautiously tugged on the rope. “Okay, Arnie. Let’s…let’s go.”

Arnie, surprisingly compliant, shuffled along the cracked pavement. They turned down a side street, the grand facades of the plaza replaced by tired brick buildings with overflowing window boxes. The air, thick with the smell of exhaust and simmering garbage, hung heavy. A cat, sleek and black as midnight, watched them with indifferent eyes from atop a overflowing dumpster.

He stopped a few blocks away, leaning against a fire hydrant, still catching his breath. “Okay, Arnie. What…what was that all about?”

Arnie responded with a series of snorts and grunts, punctuated by elaborate gestures. He pawed the ground, then mimed twirling, his snout crinkling upwards. He then pointed, with surprising accuracy, towards a television screen flickering in the window of a bodega.

Johnny followed his gaze. On the screen, flashing colours and upbeat music announced “City’s Got Talent! Auditions Next Week!” He recognized the jingle immediately. His parents had been practically worshipping at the altar of the show for weeks.

"City's Got Talent?" Johnny asked, more to himself than Arnie. “You want to…audition?”

Arnie, understanding somehow, grunted enthusiastically and did a little jig, his surprisingly agile hooves clicking on the pavement.

Johnny stared at Arnie, then back at the television screen. A pig. Dancing. On “City’s Got Talent.” The sheer absurdity of it all threatened to overwhelm him. He’d spent years crafting jokes in the privacy of his room, terrified of uttering a single word on stage, and now he was potentially managing a dancing pig’s career?

He closed his eyes, picturing his parents glued to the TV, breathless with anticipation. He could almost hear his mom, “Oh, Johnny, you should audition! It's a great opportunity!” The thought made his palms sweat.

But then he opened his eyes and looked at Arnie, who was now mimicking playing a guitar, air-strumming with his trotters. There was something about Arnie’s unwavering enthusiasm, his utter belief in himself, that was…infectious.

A slow smile crept across Johnny’s face. Maybe, just maybe, this was exactly the kind of crazy he needed. He could almost hear a tiny voice inside him, a voice that usually hid behind layers of anxiety, whispering, "What if?"

He knelt down, looking Arnie in the eye. "Okay, Arnie," he said, a newfound resolve hardening his voice. "Let's see what you've got." The weight of years of suppressed dreams, for the barest moment, seemed to lift. He still wasn't sure if this was a good idea, but one thing was certain: life had just gotten a whole lot more interesting.
