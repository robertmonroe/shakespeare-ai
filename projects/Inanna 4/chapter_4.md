## Chapter 4: Flight and Fire

### Scene 1: Inanna's Escape

The maintenance cycle hummed, seventeen minutes underway. Inanna, disguised in a technician's jumpsuit, moved with purpose through the station's amber-lit corridors. The weight of the access cylinder, containing her father's royal clearance codes, pressed against her thigh.

*Treason*, Enlil's voice echoed in her mind. She silenced it with the memory of Earth's projected timeline, the *Cleansing* dooming the primitives. Ninety-three cycles remained before the Cleansing. The Council had condemned them. Enlil, her father's commander, would approve of their extermination without hesitation.

She reached a junction. Voices ahead spoke of a fluctuation, of Enlil's increased paranoia since the mining colony sabotage. She waited, then moved toward the cargo holds. The junction's sensor array would log her passage, but the borrowed technician's credentials would mask her identity.

Descending, gravity shifted. Through a viewport, Earth swung into view, a vibrant sphere swathed in clouds. A haven teeming with life, a world under sentence.

*I'm sorry*, she thought. *I'm sorry we found you. I'm sorry for what's coming.*

She continued on.

The docking bay access demanded three authentication protocols. The access cylinder. A biometric scan, bypassed by a microscopic corruption and a purchased voice modulator mimicking the technician Ashur. Finally, a secondary encryption key she'd calculated from a signals officer's complaints and a memorized algorithm.

*Please*, she thought, as the indicator light pulsed amber.

Green.

The door irised open, revealing the reconnaissance pod bay.

Pods crouched in their berths. RP-7 sat whole and ready, its maintenance completed ahead of schedule, its readiness overlooked. An oversight Inanna had engineered.

Two technicians worked at the far end of the bay, oblivious. She crossed the floor, her heart pounding. The pod's access hatch: seventeen meters, sixteen, fifteen…

One of the technicians laughed, making her heart stutter. But they didn't turn.

Ten meters. Five.

Her hand touched the pod's hull. Relief flooded her. Inside this shell, salvation or death awaited.

The hatch opened with a soft hiss.

Inanna climbed inside. The interior was cramped, dominated by the acceleration couch and sensor displays. The restraints adjusted automatically.

*Too small*, the system would note. But too late.

Her fingers danced across the control interface, initiating launch. Power systems: online. Navigation: plotting atmospheric entry. Communications: initiating a delayed distress beacon, programmed to activate only after atmospheric entry.

The engines began their warm-up cycle.

Through the viewport, one of the technicians looked up, frowning. He tapped his companion. Both turned toward her pod, expressions shifting from confusion to alarm.

Inanna's hand hovered over the launch control.

*Ninety-three cycles*, she reminded herself. *Ninety-three cycles, and then fire.*

She pressed the control.

The pod screamed to life, magnetic clamps releasing as the launch rail seized the vessel. Alarms shrieked—Loss of containment. Unauthorized launch. Security breach—already behind her, already fading as the pod punched through the emergency barrier and into the void.

Earth filled her viewport, vast and blue.

Behind her, she knew, the station was waking to her betrayal.

### Scene 2: Falling Star

The pod plunged through the atmosphere, a searing inferno engulfing its hull. Inanna gripped the acceleration couch, her body straining against the restraints as the G-forces mounted. The heat was intense, even through the pod's shielding. Warning lights flashed, indicating system failures. The emergency stasis field flickered, threatening to engage, but she fought it, clinging to consciousness.

*Not yet*, she thought, *I need to see where I land.*

The jungle rushed up to meet her, a blur of green. She saw trees, impossibly tall, and a flash of water. The pod slammed into the earth with a deafening crash, metal screaming and shattering around her. She felt a jolt that rattled her teeth, and then, blessedly, the deceleration lessened as the pod skidded violently to a halt, grinding through vegetation.

The world spun, and pain lanced through her body, but she remained conscious, acutely aware of the scent of burning metal and scorched earth. Then darkness claimed her.

The jungle breathed in the aftermath, smoke curling through shattered branches, metal groaning as it cooled. And somewhere in the ancient darkness beneath the canopy, eyes watched. Eyes that had never seen anything like the fire that had fallen from the sky.

The jungle held its breath.

### Scene 3: Enlil's Report

**(Time Jump: Several Weeks Later)**

Twelve thousand kilometers above, on the command bridge of the *Throne of Heaven*, alarms shattered the routine calm.

On a raised dais, Enlil knelt before a shimmering holographic projection of King Anu.

"You report the loss of a survey pod, Enlil." Anu's voice resonated.

Enlil lowered his head. "Regrettably, my King. Princess Inanna commandeered the vessel without authorization."

"Treason." Anu steepled his fingers. "Do you have proof of this 'treason,' beyond the unauthorized departure?"

"The Princess had acquired data pertaining to the Cleansing protocol, my King. Sensitive information that could incite rebellion among the primitives."

Anu was silent.

Enlil's jaw tightened.

Anu sighed. "Inanna always had a… troublesome compassion. A weakness for the creatures we engineered for servitude."

"A dangerous weakness, my King. One that could jeopardize the entire mission."

"Perhaps." Anu's gaze flickered. "Or perhaps… she saw something we have forgotten." He paused. "Regardless, the matter is closed. The Cleansing will proceed as scheduled. See to it that no further… 'malfunctions' occur."

"It will be done, my King." Enlil rose, relief washing over him. He had silenced Inanna. For now.

The holographic projection flickered and vanished, leaving Enlil alone, the weight of his actions settling heavily upon his shoulders. He sensed, with a chilling undercurrent of unease, that her rebellion was far from over.
