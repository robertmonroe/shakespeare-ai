**Scene 1: Elena meets Max at their usual café**

The Café Landtmann occupied a corner where two narrow streets converged in Vienna's first district, its weathered façade unchanged since the 1920s. Max arrived fifteen minutes early, as always, claiming a table near the back where the afternoon light filtered through yellowed lace curtains. The espresso machine hissed and gurgled behind the marble counter, filling the air with the bitter-sweet aroma of dark roast.

He ordered a melange and spread a copy of *Die Presse* across the small round table, though his eyes barely registered the headlines. His left hand rested casually on the newspaper while his right traced idle patterns on the worn wood, fingers drumming a rhythm that betrayed the tension coiling in his chest.

Elena arrived precisely at three o'clock.

She wore a dove-gray coat over a simple black dress, her blonde hair pulled back in a way that made her look older, more severe. Dark glasses concealed her eyes until she removed them, folding them carefully into her handbag as she slid into the chair across from him. No smile. No greeting. Just a slight nod that could have meant anything to anyone watching.

"The usual?" Max asked in German, loud enough for the waiter hovering near the kitchen door.

"Schwarzer, bitte." Her voice was steady, but he noticed the way her fingers tightened around the strap of her handbag.

Max signaled the waiter, then leaned back in his chair, affecting the posture of a man engaged in pleasant conversation with an acquaintance. "You look tired."

"Viktor hosted a dinner last night. The Hungarian ambassador and his wife. It went until two." She paused as the waiter approached with her coffee, waiting until he'd retreated before continuing. "He was in a good mood afterward. Drank more than usual."

Max felt something cold settle in his stomach. "Elena—"

"He opened the safe." She lifted her cup, inhaling the steam. "I was bringing him water, aspirin. He didn't think I was paying attention."

The espresso machine shrieked, covering Max's sharp intake of breath. He forced himself to take a sip of his own coffee, to maintain the appearance of normalcy while his mind raced. "What did you see?"

Elena set down her cup and reached for the sugar bowl, her movements deliberate and unhurried. She tore open a packet, tapped the contents into her coffee, stirred. To anyone watching, it was the most mundane of gestures.

"The safe is behind a painting in his study," she said softly. "Klimt reproduction. Terrible fake, but Viktor thinks it's sophisticated." Her lips curved in something that wasn't quite a smile. "It's a Bausch combination lock. German-made. The dial has to be turned right first, then left, then right again."

Max pulled a small notebook from his jacket pocket—the kind tourists used for jotting down museum hours and restaurant recommendations. He wrote the date at the top of a fresh page, then a few innocuous words about Viennese architecture. Beneath them, in smaller letters: *Bausch. R-L-R.*

"The combination?"

"I only saw part of it." Elena's voice remained conversational, but her eyes had gone distant, as if she were watching the memory play out behind them. "He was standing in front of the dial, but I could see his hand movements. The first number is somewhere between twenty and thirty—his hand didn't move far. The second is higher, maybe sixty or seventy. The third..." She shook her head. "I couldn't see. He shifted his position."

Max wrote: *20-30 / 60-70 / ?*

"That's not enough," he said, keeping his tone light, as if commenting on the weather.

"I know." Elena lifted her coffee cup again, and he noticed the faint tremor in her hand. "But there's more. Viktor has a pattern. Every Tuesday and Thursday morning, he goes to the embassy at nine. Doesn't return until after two. The housekeeper, Frau Hoffman, does the marketing on Tuesdays between ten and noon. The gardener only comes on Wednesdays and Saturdays."

Max's pen moved across the page, disguising intelligence in the margins of tourist notes. "Security system?"

"Basic alarm on the doors and ground-floor windows. Code is 1917." She allowed herself a thin smile. "Viktor's sense of history is predictable."

"Cameras?"

"None inside. Two outside—front entrance and the garden gate. They record to a system in the basement utility room."

Max looked up from his notebook. Elena was watching him now, her blue eyes clear and unflinching. The tremor in her hand had steadied.

"You've been very thorough," he said quietly.

"I'm not a fool, Max. I know what this requires." She leaned forward slightly, lowering her voice until it was barely audible above the café's ambient noise. "There's a reception next Thursday. The French embassy. Some cultural exchange nonsense. Viktor expects me to attend."

"Expected attendance?"

"Two hundred people. Maybe more. It's a significant event—the ambassador will be there, along with half the diplomatic corps." Elena's fingers traced the rim of her cup. "It starts at seven. Viktor will want to stay until at least ten, probably later. He enjoys these things, the networking."

Max felt the pieces clicking into place, saw the operation taking shape even as dread pooled in his gut. "You'd have a window. If you could slip away."

"I could claim a headache. Migraine. I get them sometimes—Viktor knows this." Her voice remained steady, but Max caught the slight catch in her breath. "I could take a car home, tell him I need to lie down. He wouldn't leave early, not for something like that. Not when there are people to impress."

The café door opened, admitting a gust of cool autumn air and two elderly women who settled at a table near the window. Max waited until their chatter filled the space before responding.

"That would leave you alone," he said. "No backup. No support if something goes wrong."

"Yes."

"Elena—"

"What choice do we have?" She met his gaze without flinching. "You can't be there. If Viktor came home early and found you in his study, it would be over. For both of us." She paused. "This is the only way."

Max wanted to argue, to find another solution, but he knew she was right. The operation required access when Viktor was occupied and accounted for, when the house would be empty, when Elena could move freely without raising suspicion. A diplomatic reception provided all of that.

"The documents," he said. "Where does he keep them?"

"In the safe. He removes them sometimes, works on them in his study. I've seen folders—red ones with Cyrillic markings. Official seals." Elena's voice dropped even lower. "Last week, I heard him on the phone speaking Russian. He mentioned names. Dates. Something about a transfer scheduled for November."

Max's pen stilled. "What kind of transfer?"

"I don't know. He switched to code words when he realized I was in the hallway." She wrapped both hands around her coffee cup, as if seeking warmth. "But he was agitated afterward. Drank three glasses of vodka before dinner."

The intelligence was better than Max had hoped for, more detailed, more actionable. It also meant Elena had been taking enormous risks, listening at doors, watching Viktor's movements, memorizing details that could get her killed if she made one wrong move.

"You need to be careful," he said, knowing how inadequate the words were. "If he suspects—"

"He doesn't." Elena's voice carried absolute certainty. "Viktor sees what he wants to see. A beautiful wife. A trophy. Someone grateful for his protection." The bitterness in her tone was sharp enough to cut. "He doesn't see me watching. He never has."

Max made a few more notes, disguising them among sketches of the café's interior, architectural details that meant nothing. When he looked up again, Elena was studying his face with an intensity that made him uncomfortable.

"What?" he asked.

"You're afraid."

"Of course I'm afraid. This is—"

"Not for yourself." She tilted her head slightly. "For me."

Max closed his notebook, slipped it back into his jacket. "We should discuss operational details. Timing, equipment, contingencies."

"Max."

He met her eyes, saw understanding there that went deeper than tradecraft or operational necessity. "Yes. I'm afraid for you. That's not professional, and it's not helpful, but it's the truth."

Elena reached across the table, her hand hovering near his for just

**Scene 2: In a secure safehouse, Max tra...**

**Scene 2: In a secure safehouse, Max trains Elena in basic tradecraft techniques**

The safehouse smelled of old radiator heat and furniture polish. Max had chosen it deliberately—a fourth-floor walkup in Vienna's 7th district, the kind of building where neighbors minded their own business and footsteps on the stairs provided ample warning. Late afternoon light filtered through lace curtains, casting geometric shadows across the worn parquet floor.

Elena stood at the dining table, her coat draped over a chair, examining the miniature Minox camera with the focused intensity Max had come to recognize. She turned it over in her hands, testing its weight, her pianist's fingers exploring the mechanism with surprising delicacy.

"It's smaller than I imagined," she said.

"German engineering." Max moved beside her, close enough to catch the scent of her perfume—something subtle, expensive. He forced himself to focus on the task. "The Minox B. Eight millimeters. Fits in the palm of your hand, and it can photograph documents with perfect clarity in low light."

He demonstrated, clicking the shutter mechanism. The sound was barely audible, a whisper of metal on metal.

"How many exposures?"

"Fifty per cassette. More than enough for what you'll need." He set the camera down and spread several sheets of typed text across the table—CIA training documents, meaningless bureaucratic drivel that looked official enough for practice. "The key is consistency. Same distance every time, same lighting if possible. Viktor's study has a desk lamp?"

"Brass. On the left side of his desk."

"Good. Position each document directly under the light. Hold the camera at chest height, fourteen inches from the paper. The focus is preset—you don't need to adjust anything." He handed her the camera. "Try it."

Elena positioned herself over the first document, raising the camera. Her hand trembled slightly.

"Breathe," Max said quietly. "You're not being timed. Not yet."

She exhaled slowly, steadied her grip, and clicked. The sound seemed louder in the silent apartment.

"Again. Five more."

She worked through the stack, her movements growing more fluid with each exposure. Max watched her face—the concentration tightening the corners of her eyes, the way she bit her lower lip between shots. She was memorizing the motion, building muscle memory.

"How was that?" she asked, lowering the camera.

"Twelve seconds for six documents. Not bad for a first attempt." He gathered the papers, shuffled them, spread them out again. "Do it in eight."

This time she moved faster, more confident. The camera whispered its mechanical rhythm.

"Seven seconds," Max said, checking his watch. "You're a natural."

"I spent fifteen years performing Chopin under scrutiny. This is just a different kind of performance." But her smile didn't reach her eyes. "What happens if someone comes home early? If Viktor forgets something?"

Max had been dreading this question. He moved to the window, checking the street below—a habit, always checking. "You abort. Leave everything exactly as you found it and get out. There's a service entrance through the kitchen that leads to the back courtyard. From there, you can access the alley behind Brahmsplatz. I'll have a car positioned two blocks north, on Neustiftgasse."

"And if I can't get to the car?"

"Then you walk. Calmly. You're a diplomat's wife who felt unwell at a reception and came home early. Nothing suspicious about that." He turned from the window. "But Elena, if there's any indication that something's wrong—if you feel watched, if the timing seems off—you don't go through with it. Do you understand?"

"I understand the words you're saying." She set the camera down carefully. "But we both know I won't abort. Not when we're this close."

The certainty in her voice sent ice through Max's chest. He'd seen this before—assets who became so committed to an operation that they lost their sense of self-preservation. It was useful, professionally. It was also terrifying.

"Let me show you something else." He retrieved a small leather case from his jacket, opened it to reveal a compact set of lockpicks. "You said you've seen Viktor open the safe twice. That you memorized part of the combination."

"The first three numbers. Twenty-seven, fourteen, thirty-eight. Then he shifted position and I couldn't see the rest."

Max nodded, unsurprised. Most people were creatures of habit, careless with their secrets. "A six-number combination. That leaves three unknowns. Do you remember which direction he turned the dial for each number?"

Elena closed her eyes, and Max watched her face as she replayed the memory. "Right for twenty-seven. Left for fourteen. Right again for thirty-eight. Then... left, right, left for the last three."

"You're certain?"

"I have perfect pitch, Max. I remember patterns." She opened her eyes. "Will that help?"

"It narrows the possibilities considerably. But we're still talking about a thousand potential combinations for the last three numbers." He studied her expression, looking for doubt, for hesitation. Found only steel resolve. "There's another option. If you can get me into the house when Viktor's away, I can crack it myself."

"No." The word was immediate, absolute. "Viktor has the house watched when he's gone. Security checks twice daily. A stranger in the house would be noticed immediately." She picked up the camera again, testing its weight. "Besides, I know the safe. I've watched him. This is my operation."

*My operation.* Max felt something twist in his chest—pride and terror in equal measure.

"Then we practice the combination work." He pulled a portable safe from beneath the table—a training model he'd requisitioned from the Vienna station. "Standard rotary dial, same as Viktor's. I'm going to teach you how to feel for the contact points, how to work through combinations systematically."

For the next hour, they worked in focused silence broken only by the clicking of the dial and Max's quiet instructions. Elena's fingers moved across the metal surface with the same precision she'd shown with the camera, learning to sense the subtle resistance that indicated a correct number.

The light outside shifted from gold to amber to grey. Max switched on the table lamp, and in its warm glow, Elena looked younger, more vulnerable. A woman who should have been preparing for a concert, not a covert operation that could get her killed.

"I need to know," she said suddenly, not looking up from the safe. "If something goes wrong. If I'm caught. What happens to me?"

Max had prepared for this question too, had rehearsed various versions of reassurance. But looking at her now, backlit by the lamp, her hands steady on the dial, he found he couldn't lie.

"Best case, diplomatic scandal. Viktor divorces you, you're expelled from Austria. We bring you in, debrief you, resettle you somewhere safe."

"And worst case?"

"You disappear. Viktor has friends in the KGB who don't respect diplomatic niceties. They'd want to know everything—who recruited you, what you've passed, what else you know." He paused. "I won't let it get that far."

Elena looked up at him then, and her smile was sad, knowing. "You can't promise that."

"No," Max admitted. "But I can promise I'll do everything in my power to get you out. I have a team standing by, independent of official channels. If you signal for extraction, they'll move immediately."

"Independent of official channels." She set down the dial. "You mean your superiors don't know about them."

"What they don't know can't be compromised."

"Or what they don't know can't stop you from doing something foolish." Elena stood, moved closer to him. In the lamplight, he could see the fine lines around her eyes, the shadows beneath them. "You're risking your career for me."

"I'm ensuring an asset's safety. Standard protocol."

"Is it?" She was close enough now that he could feel the warmth of her. "Is this how you treat all your assets, Max?"

The question hung between them, dangerous and honest. Through the window, Vienna's evening sounds filtered up—a tram bell, distant traffic, someone's radio playing Strauss. The ordinary life of a city that had no idea what was happening in this anonymous apartment.

"No," Max said finally. "It isn't."

Elena nodded, as if he'd confirmed something she already knew. She returned to the table, to the safe and the camera and the careful choreography of espionage. "Show me again," she said. "The emergency protocols. I want to know every exit, every contingency."

So Max walked her through it again. The routes, the signals, the dead drops. The

**Scene 3: Max reviews the plan for the u...**

**Scene 3: Max reviews the plan for the upcoming diplomatic reception**

The safehouse apartment felt smaller in the evening light, shadows pooling in the corners like spilled ink. Max had spread a hand-drawn floor plan of the Volkov residence across the scarred wooden table, weighted down at the corners with coffee cups and a half-empty bottle of vodka neither of them had touched.

Elena stood beside him, her arms crossed, studying the diagram with the same intensity she might give to a medical chart. The window behind them was cracked open, letting in the distant sounds of Moscow traffic and the faint smell of rain on concrete.

"Walk me through it again," Max said, tapping the paper with his pen. "From the moment you arrive at the reception."

She didn't hesitate. "We arrive at the Metropol at eight. Viktor will make his rounds—he always does. The Bulgarian ambassador, the trade minister, probably twenty minutes of conversation with each. I'll stay close initially, play the dutiful wife."

"How long before you make your move?"

"Nine-fifteen at the earliest. Not before the first course is served. If I leave too early, people notice. Too late, and Viktor starts looking for me." She traced a finger along the route from the hotel to their home. "Fifteen minutes by car, assuming Dmitri doesn't hit traffic on Tverskaya."

Max felt his jaw tighten. Dmitri was Viktor's driver, loyal as a guard dog. "You're sure he'll take you without question?"

"I'll tell him I have a migraine. That I forgot my medication at home." Elena's voice was steady, but Max caught the slight tension in her shoulders. "Dmitri has driven me home early before. Twice in the past year."

"And if he insists on waiting?"

"I send him back. Tell him I need to lie down, that Viktor will call when he's ready to leave." She met Max's eyes. "Dmitri won't argue. He knows better than to keep Viktor waiting at these events."

Max nodded, making a notation on the timeline he'd sketched beside the floor plan. The margins were already crowded with his tight handwriting—contingencies, abort signals, emergency protocols. "So you're home by nine-thirty. That gives you what, ninety minutes before Viktor typically leaves these things?"

"Closer to two hours. He never leaves before eleven-thirty. It would be rude." A bitter smile crossed her face. "Viktor is very concerned with appearances."

"Two hours to get into the study, open the safe, photograph everything, replace it all exactly as it was, and get back to the reception." Max set down his pen and rubbed his eyes. "Elena, that's—"

"Tight. I know." She moved around the table, pointing to the study marked on the floor plan. "But the staff will be gone. Irina has Thursday nights off, and Sergei always visits his sister when Viktor is out. The house will be empty."

Max studied her profile in the fading light. She'd pulled her hair back, and without makeup, she looked younger than her thirty-four years. Vulnerable. The thought made his chest constrict.

"What about the alarm system?"

"Disabled when we're home. Viktor only sets it when the house is completely empty." She glanced at him. "He's paranoid about foreign threats, not domestic ones. It's his blind spot."

"Let's hope it stays that way." Max picked up the miniature camera they'd been practicing with—a Minox C, small enough to conceal in a compact or cigarette case. "Show me again. Documents on the desk, proper lighting."

Elena took the camera, her fingers finding the controls without looking. She'd practiced for hours over the past three days, until the movements became muscle memory. "Lay the document flat. Check the frame through the viewfinder. Steady pressure on the shutter release." She mimed the action, her hands rock-steady. "Two shots of each page, different angles in case one is blurred."

"And if you hear something? Car in the driveway, key in the lock?"

"Leave everything. Exit through the kitchen to the garden. Over the back wall to the Petrovs' property." She set down the camera. "You'll have someone waiting on Sretensky Boulevard?"

"A car. Dark blue Volga. If you make it there, they'll take you straight to the embassy." Max didn't mention that he'd had to call in personal favors for this, that Sarah Chen would have his head if she knew he was running an unauthorized extraction. "But that's only if everything goes completely wrong. The plan is for you to get back to the reception."

"I know the plan, Max."

"I need you to know the backup plan. And the backup to the backup." He moved closer, unable to help himself. "If Viktor suspects anything—"

"He won't."

"If he does—" Max caught her wrist, gently but firmly. "Elena, if he suspects, you run. You don't try to explain, you don't try to salvage it. You run, and you don't look back."

She looked down at his hand on her wrist, then back up at his face. In the dimming light, her eyes were dark pools. "And leave you with nothing? After everything we've—"

"I don't care about the operation." The words came out harder than he intended. "I care about you getting out alive."

The silence between them stretched taut. Outside, a siren wailed, distant and mournful.

Elena pulled her wrist free, but not unkindly. "Let's go through the timing again. If I'm back at the reception by eleven, what's my story?"

Max forced himself to focus, to slip back into the professional distance he'd been trained to maintain. "You went home, took your medication, rested for an hour. You felt better and didn't want to abandon Viktor at such an important event. Dmitri brought you back."

"Will Dmitri confirm that?"

"He won't have a choice if you call him to come get you. Just make sure you're visible at the reception before Viktor starts looking." Max checked his watch. "We should run through the camera work again. In lower light this time. The study will only have the desk lamp."

Elena nodded, but she was looking at the floor plan again, her brow furrowed. "There's something I haven't told you."

Max felt ice slide down his spine. "What?"

"The safe combination. I said I'd memorized part of it." She traced a finger along the edge of the table. "I've memorized all of it. I've watched Viktor open it four times now, not twice. I'm certain of the numbers."

Relief and new fear warred in Max's chest. "Why didn't you say something?"

"Because I wanted to be sure. Because if I'm wrong, if I trigger the lock mechanism..." She met his eyes. "There's no coming back from that. Viktor would know immediately that someone tried to access it."

"Can you open it?"

"Yes."

The certainty in her voice should have reassured him. Instead, it made everything feel more real, more immediate. They were actually going to do this. In less than forty-eight hours, Elena would be alone in that house, her hands on Viktor Volkov's safe, one mistake away from exposure, imprisonment, or worse.

Max moved to the window, needing air, needing distance. The Moscow skyline stretched before him, lights beginning to wink on as dusk deepened into night. Somewhere out there, Viktor Volkov was sitting in his study, perhaps opening that very safe, unaware that his wife had become his greatest vulnerability.

"We should eat something," Elena said behind him. "You haven't eaten all day."

"Neither have you."

"I'm not hungry."

Max turned to find her still at the table, one hand resting on the floor plan as if she could absorb the layout through her fingertips. The set of her shoulders told him everything—she was terrified and trying desperately not to show it.

He crossed back to her, close enough to smell her perfume, something subtle and expensive that Viktor had probably bought her. "Elena—"

"Don't." She held up a hand. "Don't tell me I don't have to do this. Don't give me an out. I've made my choice."

"I was going to say you're the bravest person I've ever met."

Her composure cracked, just for a moment. She looked away, blinking rapidly. "I don't feel brave. I feel like I'm standing on the edge of a cliff."

"That's what courage is. Being terrified and jumping anyway." Max reached for her hand, laced his fingers through hers. "But you don't jump alone. I'll be there. Not in the house, but close. Monitoring the radio frequency

**Scene 4: Max secretly contacts a CIA ex...**

**Scene 4: Max secretly contacts a CIA extraction team**

The phone booth smelled of stale cigarettes and damp wool, its glass panels fogged with condensation from the evening rain. Max wedged himself inside, pulling the folding door closed with more force than necessary. The overhead bulb flickered, casting erratic shadows across the scratched metal surfaces.

He fed a handful of coins into the slot and dialed a number he'd committed to memory three years ago—one he'd sworn never to use except in the most extreme circumstances.

The line clicked twice. Then silence.

"Nightingale," Max said quietly, using the recognition code.

Another click. "This line is for emergencies only." The voice was American, flat and professional. Boston accent, maybe. Someone Max had never met.

"This qualifies."

"Authentication?"

Max recited a twelve-digit sequence, his breath forming small clouds in the cramped space. Outside, a couple hurried past beneath a shared umbrella, their laughter muffled by the rain drumming against the booth's metal roof.

"Authenticated. What's your situation?"

"I need an extraction package. Full protocol. Vienna station, but off-book."

The pause that followed stretched long enough for Max's pulse to accelerate. He pressed his free hand against the cold glass, watching water stream down in rivulets.

"Off-book means unauthorized," the voice said carefully. "You understand what you're requesting?"

"I understand perfectly."

"Does your handler know?"

"No."

Another pause. Max could hear the faint sound of typing on the other end. Someone making notes, or perhaps checking his file, verifying he had the authority to make such a request—even if that authority would evaporate the moment Sarah Chen discovered what he'd done.

"Asset or personal?"

The question hung in the air like smoke. Max closed his eyes. The truth would complicate things. A lie might get Elena killed.

"Both," he said.

The typing stopped. "That's a problem."

"It's my problem."

"It becomes our problem if this goes sideways. If you're compromised, if the asset is compromised, if Vienna station gets burned because you decided to play hero—"

"I'm not playing anything." Max's voice hardened. "I need a clean extraction route, a safe house outside Vienna, and a standby team within thirty minutes of the target location. I need it ready by tomorrow night."

"Tomorrow?" The voice cracked slightly, professional composure slipping. "Jesus Christ. What kind of operation are we talking about?"

"The kind that doesn't exist on paper."

More typing. Max watched a streetcar glide past, its windows glowing warm yellow against the darkness. Normal people heading home to normal lives. He'd forgotten what that felt like.

"I can get you a team," the voice said finally. "But it'll cost you. Not money—your career. You go off-book on something like this, and if it blows up, you're done. No protection, no plausible deniability. They'll hang you out to dry."

"I know."

"And you're still requesting this?"

Max thought of Elena's face in the café, the way her hands had trembled when she'd described Viktor's safe. The way she'd looked at him when she'd agreed to this insanity, trusting him to keep her alive.

"I'm still requesting this."

A long exhale crackled through the receiver. "Give me the details. Location, timeline, contingencies."

Max rattled off the information quickly, precisely. Viktor's address, the diplomatic reception's schedule, the three-hour window when the house would be empty except for Elena. He described the backup plans, the abort signals, the ways it could all go wrong.

"If she signals compromise, I need your team moving immediately. Not in five minutes, not in two—immediately."

"Understood. Anything else?"

"If this goes south, if Viktor discovers what she's done—she gets priority extraction. Not the documents, not the operation. Her."

"That's not how this works."

"That's how this works for me." Max's voice dropped to something barely above a whisper, but there was steel underneath. "Or I hang up now and do this completely alone."

The silence stretched out again. Max could hear his own heartbeat, feel the cramped walls of the phone booth pressing in. His breath had fogged the glass completely now, sealing him in a private cocoon of condensation and shadow.

"All right," the voice said. "But you're signing your own termination papers."

"Then I'll sign them."

"Team will be in position by twenty-two hundred hours tomorrow. Safe house coordinates will be delivered via dead drop—usual location, Stadtpark, north bench. Recognition phrase is 'the weather's better in Prague.' Response is 'but the coffee's terrible.'"

"Confirmed."

"And Monroe? When this is over, assuming you're still breathing, you and I never had this conversation."

"What conversation?"

The line went dead.

Max hung up the receiver slowly, his hand lingering on the cold plastic. Through the fogged glass, Vienna blurred into abstract shapes of light and darkness. Somewhere out there, Sarah Chen was probably filing reports, trusting him to follow protocol. Somewhere, Elena was preparing herself for tomorrow night, trusting him to keep her safe.

He couldn't do both.

He pushed open the phone booth door and stepped into the rain. It soaked through his coat immediately, cold and cleansing. He didn't bother pulling up his collar. The walk back to his apartment would take twenty minutes, and he needed every one of them to prepare for what he'd just set in motion.

The die was cast. Tomorrow night, Elena would walk into Viktor's study and photograph documents that could reshape the intelligence landscape of Eastern Europe. And if anything went wrong—if Viktor returned early, if the household staff discovered her, if the KGB had somehow compromised her from the start—Max had just burned every bridge in his career to make sure she'd survive it.

He turned up a side street, his footsteps echoing off the wet cobblestones. In his pocket, his hand found the miniature camera he'd been carrying—the one he'd give to Elena tomorrow during their final training session.

Such a small thing to risk everything for.

But then again, Elena was risking more.

**Scene 5: The night before the operation...**

The hotel room was smaller than Elena had imagined. Somehow she'd expected something grander from the CIA—leather chairs, perhaps, or sleek modern furniture. Instead, Max's room at the Pension Neuer Markt was modest: a double bed with a wrought-iron headframe, cream-colored walls that had yellowed with age, a single window overlooking a courtyard where rain now pattered against cobblestones.

She stood by that window, still wearing her coat, watching the water stream down the glass.

"You don't have to stay," Max said quietly behind her. He was sitting on the edge of the bed, forearms resting on his knees. "I can take you back."

Elena turned. The room's single lamp cast warm shadows across his face, highlighting the tension in his jaw, the exhaustion around his eyes. They'd spent three hours going over the operation until every movement was choreographed, every contingency planned. Now, at midnight, there was nothing left to rehearse.

"Do you want me to go?"

The question hung between them. Max stood slowly, crossed to where she stood. His hand reached up, hesitated, then gently brushed a strand of dark hair from her face.

"No," he said. "God, no."

She turned back to the window, and he moved behind her, close enough that she could feel his warmth. In the glass, their reflections overlapped—two ghosts suspended between the room's amber light and the courtyard's darkness.

"I used to love the rain," Elena said. "When I was a girl in Moscow, I would sneak onto our apartment's balcony during storms. My mother would scold me, say I'd catch pneumonia." She smiled faintly. "Viktor hates the rain. Says it reminds him of his childhood, of being poor."

Max's hands settled on her shoulders, a gentle weight. "Tell me something else. Something real."

"What do you mean?"

"Anything. Your favorite book. The first concert you attended. What you wanted to be when you were ten." His voice dropped. "I want to know you. Not the asset. Not the operation. You."

Elena closed her eyes. Through the window, she could hear Vienna settling into sleep—distant traffic, a church bell tolling the hour, the rain's steady percussion.

"I wanted to be a pianist," she said. "I was actually quite good. My teacher said I had the hands for it—long fingers, good reach." She flexed her hands against the glass. "My father was a literature professor. Not wealthy, not connected, just... good. He died when I was seventeen. Heart attack in his office, grading papers."

Max's grip tightened almost imperceptibly.

"My mother remarried within a year. A Party official. I was nineteen when Viktor noticed me at a reception." Her laugh was bitter. "I thought he was sophisticated. Worldly. I thought marrying him meant freedom."

"Elena—"

"Tomorrow," she interrupted, "when I photograph those documents, when I betray him—it should feel like justice, shouldn't it? Like I'm finally taking something back." She turned in Max's arms, meeting his eyes. "But it doesn't. It feels like I'm falling from a very high place, and I don't know what's at the bottom."

Max cupped her face in his hands. His thumbs traced her cheekbones with infinite gentleness. "I won't let you fall."

"You can't promise that."

"I know." His forehead touched hers. "But I'm making the promise anyway."

The kiss, when it came, was soft and desperate all at once. Elena's hands found the fabric of his shirt, clutching it as if he were an anchor in a storm. Max pulled her closer, one hand tangling in her hair, the other at the small of her back, and for a moment the fear receded, replaced by something equally terrifying—the realization that this man, this American spy she'd known for mere weeks, had become essential.

When they broke apart, both were breathing hard.

"I'm scared," Elena whispered. It was the first time she'd said it aloud.

"Me too."

She looked at him, surprised. Max guided her to the bed, and they sat together, shoulders touching. He took her hand, tracing the lines of her palm with one finger.

"In Saigon," he said quietly, "I lost someone. An informant. A good man with a family. I promised him he'd be safe, that we'd get him out." His finger stilled. "I was wrong. They found him before the extraction. Made an example of him."

"Max—"

"I've run dozens of operations since then. Recruited assets, gathered intelligence, completed missions. But I never..." He paused, struggling for words. "I never felt like this. Like if something goes wrong tomorrow, it won't just be a professional failure. It'll be—"

"The end of something that barely got to begin," Elena finished.

Their eyes met, and the understanding that passed between them needed no words.

They lay down together, still clothed, Elena's head on Max's chest, his arm around her shoulders. The rain continued its rhythm against the window. Neither spoke about the morning, about the diplomatic reception or the miniature camera or the safe in Viktor's study. Those realities would come soon enough.

"Tell me about Montana," Elena said into the darkness. "Your cabin in the mountains."

Max's hand moved in slow circles on her back. "It's small. One room, really, with a loft for sleeping. There's a stream about fifty yards down the slope—you can hear it at night. In winter, the snow gets so deep you can't reach the road for weeks."

"It sounds lonely."

"It is." His voice was soft. "But sometimes lonely is safer."

Elena tilted her head to look at him. "And after tomorrow? Will you go back there?"

The question carried weight they both recognized. Max's hand stilled on her back.

"I don't know," he admitted. "I don't know anything anymore except that I want you safe. Everything else is—" He stopped, jaw working.

Elena reached up, touching his face. "Say it."

"Secondary." The word came out rough. "Everything else is secondary."

She kissed him then, slow and searching, tasting the confession on his lips. When they settled back together, her fingers intertwined with his, holding on.

Outside, the rain began to ease. A clock somewhere chimed two. Vienna slept, unaware that in a modest hotel room near the Stephansplatz, two people were storing up moments against an uncertain future—the warmth of skin, the rhythm of breathing, the weight of hands clasped in the dark.

"I'm glad it was you," Elena whispered. "If this had to happen—if I had to do this—I'm glad it was you who found me."

Max pulled her closer, his lips against her hair. "Sleep," he murmured. "I've got you."

But neither of them slept. They lay awake through the small hours, two souls suspended between what they'd been and what they'd become, knowing that dawn would bring the reckoning. The miniature camera sat on the dresser, a tiny mechanical eye that would see everything tomorrow. The extraction plan was memorized. The contingencies prepared.

All that remained was the doing.

As gray light began to seep around the curtains, Elena felt Max's breathing finally slow into something approaching rest. She studied his face in the dimness—the strong jaw, the lines that spoke of too many secrets carried too long, the vulnerability that sleep revealed.

She memorized it all, storing every detail like the documents she'd photograph in a few short hours.

Because after today, nothing would be the same.

And neither of them could promise they'd survive what came next.

**Scene 6: In the early morning hours bef...**

**Scene 6: In the early morning hours before dawn**

The city beyond the window existed in that liminal space between night and morning, when Moscow held its breath before exhaling into another day. Max sat in the leather chair by the window, the extraction plans spread across his lap like a hand of cards he couldn't afford to lose.

Elena slept in his bed, her dark hair fanned across the pillow, one hand curled beneath her cheek. The streetlight from below cast amber shadows across her face, softening the tension that had lived there for the past three days of preparation. In sleep, she looked younger. Vulnerable.

Max's chest tightened.

He forced his attention back to the documents. The extraction route was clean—a diplomatic vehicle would be waiting three blocks from Viktor's residence at 22:00 hours. Elena would have exactly forty-seven minutes from the moment she left the reception to photograph the contents of the safe and reach the pickup point. The CIA team didn't know her identity; they'd been told only that they were extracting a high-value asset. Sarah Chen's name appeared nowhere in the operational paperwork.

Because Sarah Chen didn't know this operation existed.

Max rubbed his eyes, feeling the weight of every protocol he'd violated, every rule he'd broken. Going off-book. Running an unauthorized extraction. Falling in—

He stopped that thought before it could fully form, but it was too late. The truth sat in his chest like a stone.

*Cardinal sin of espionage*, his instructor at the Farm had said, twenty years and a lifetime ago. *The moment you care more about your asset than the mission, you've already lost.*

Elena stirred, murmuring something in Russian he couldn't quite catch. Her hand reached across the empty space where he'd been lying hours before, searching. Even in sleep, she was looking for him.

Max set the papers aside and moved to the bed, sitting carefully on its edge. He shouldn't touch her. Shouldn't compound the mistake he'd already made. But his hand moved of its own accord, brushing a strand of hair from her forehead.

She was risking everything tomorrow night. Her marriage, her safety, possibly her life. And for what? Idealism? Revenge against a husband who'd turned their home into a prison? Or something else—something that had grown between them in stolen moments and whispered conversations?

The extraction plans were perfect. He'd checked them seventeen times. The timing was tight but achievable. The safe house in Helsinki was ready. New identity documents waited in a locked drawer. He'd thought of everything.

Except how to live with himself if something went wrong.

Elena's eyes opened, finding him immediately in the darkness. "You're still awake."

"Couldn't sleep."

She sat up, the sheet pooling around her waist. In the amber light, her eyes looked almost gold. "Second thoughts?"

"About the operation?" Max shook his head. "It's solid. You'll be fine."

"That's not what I asked."

The silence stretched between them, filled with everything they hadn't said, couldn't say. In the distance, a church bell tolled five times. Two hours until dawn. Twelve hours until the reception.

"I've been doing this for fifteen years," Max said finally, his voice low. "Recruited assets in seven countries. Ran operations in places that would make tomorrow night look like a walk in the park." He met her gaze. "I've never been afraid before."

Elena reached for his hand, her fingers cool against his palm. "I'm afraid too."

"You don't have to do this. We can abort. Find another way."

"There is no other way." Her grip tightened. "You know that."

He did know. The documents in Viktor's safe contained proof of a network that stretched from Moscow to Washington, names of compromised officials, details of operations that could reshape the intelligence landscape. If they didn't act now, the window would close. People would die. Assets would be burned.

The mission was everything.

Except it wasn't. Not anymore.

Max lifted her hand to his lips, pressing a kiss to her knuckles. "I'm going to get you out," he said, and it sounded like a vow. "Whatever happens tomorrow night, whatever goes wrong—I will get you out. Do you understand?"

Elena's free hand came up to cup his face, her thumb tracing the line of his jaw. "I trust you."

Those three words nearly broke him.

He pulled her close, breathing in the scent of her hair, feeling her heartbeat against his chest. Outside, the sky was beginning to lighten, purple bleeding into the darkness. In a few hours, she would return to Viktor's house. Put on the designer dress for the reception. Smile and play the role of the perfect diplomat's wife one final time.

And Max would be in position, monitoring the operation from a surveillance van three blocks away, every second an eternity until she was safe.

"When this is over," Elena whispered against his shoulder, "when we're in Helsinki—"

"Don't." Max's voice was rough. "Don't plan that far ahead. Just focus on tomorrow night. One step at a time."

She pulled back to look at him, and something in her expression made his breath catch. "You think we won't make it."

"I think," Max said carefully, "that I've never wanted anything to work as much as I want this to work."

The admission hung between them, heavy with implications. Elena's eyes searched his face, and whatever she saw there made her lean forward, pressing her forehead to his.

"Then it will work," she said. "It has to."

Max closed his eyes, committing this moment to memory—the weight of her against him, the sound of her breathing, the way the dawn light was starting to paint the room in shades of rose and gold. Tomorrow, everything would change. Tomorrow, they would both cross lines they could never uncross.

But right now, in this stolen moment before the world woke up, he allowed himself to hold her. To make a silent promise that he would keep her safe, even if it meant sacrificing everything else.

Even if it meant sacrificing himself.

The church bell tolled again, marking the half hour. Time was running out, the way it always did. Max opened his eyes and looked at the extraction plans still scattered on the chair, at the miniature camera on the nightstand, at all the careful preparations that would either save them or damn them.

"We should go over it one more time," he said quietly. "The timeline, the contingencies—"

"Max." Elena's voice was soft but firm. "We've been over it a hundred times. I know what to do."

"If Viktor comes back early—"

"I abort and go to the secondary extraction point."

"If the safe combination has changed—"

"I photograph what I can access and leave. No heroics." She took his face in both hands, forcing him to meet her eyes. "I know the plan. I know the risks. And I know you'll be there."

He wanted to argue, to run through every scenario one more time, to find some flaw in the operation that he could fix before it was too late. But the look in her eyes stopped him.

She wasn't afraid. Not of tomorrow, not of Viktor, not of the impossible thing they were about to attempt.

She was only afraid of one thing: that he wouldn't let her do this.

Max pulled her close again, pressing a kiss to her temple. "Okay," he whispered. "Okay."

They lay back down together as the dawn broke over Moscow, neither of them sleeping, both of them counting down the hours until everything changed. And in the growing light, Max made his final calculation—the one that mattered more than all the others.

No matter what it cost him, no matter what rules he had to break or bridges he had to burn, he would get Elena Volkov out alive.

Even if it meant destroying himself in the process.
