## Chapter 2: Forbidden Compassion

**Scene 1: ---**

**Scene 1: The Weight of Stolen Memory**

The neural archive chamber hummed with a frequency just below conscious perception, a sound that Inanna felt more than heard—a vibration that settled into her bones like the echo of forgotten prayers. She stood before the crystalline interface, her fingers hovering above the luminescent surface, hesitating.

*You shouldn't be here.*

The thought came unbidden, accompanied by the phantom taste of something she hadn't experienced in three thousand years. Something earthy. Something *human*.

Bread. It had been bread.

Inanna closed her eyes, and the memory surged forward like a tide she could no longer hold back.

---

*She was young then—barely past her first century, still wearing the awkward proportions of Anunnaki adolescence. Her skin hadn't yet developed the subtle bioluminescence of adulthood, and her cranial ridges were soft, malleable things that ached when the atmospheric pressure shifted.*

*The descent pod had been a stolen thing, borrowed from the maintenance bay while the technicians cycled through their regeneration period. She'd programmed it for a remote sector, far from the mining operations and the processing facilities where humans labored under the watchful eyes of her father's overseers.*

*Earth's surface had hit her like a physical blow.*

*The air—thick, wet, alive with particles and microorganisms that made her nasal filters work overtime. The gravity, heavier than the station's artificial pull, pressed down on her shoulders like disapproval made manifest. And the colors—Anu's throne, the colors. The orbital archives showed Earth in clinical wavelengths, sanitized data streams of topographical information. They hadn't prepared her for the violent green of growing things, the impossible blue of unfiltered sky, the rich brown of soil that seemed to breathe.*

*She'd wandered from the pod, her environmental suit's camouflage systems flickering uncertainly in the uncontrolled light. The settlement was small—a cluster of crude shelters built from materials the Anunnaki had deemed too worthless to harvest. Humans moved between the structures with the particular shuffle of the exhausted, their bodies bent by labor and malnutrition.*

*And then she'd seen the child.*

*Small, even by human standards. Female, perhaps six or seven cycles old by their brief calendar. The girl sat alone at the edge of the settlement, her back against a sun-warmed stone, methodically breaking pieces from a hard, dark loaf and placing them in her mouth with the careful deliberation of someone who knew exactly how little remained.*

*Inanna's camouflage failed.*

*Later, she would blame the atmospheric interference, the unfamiliar electromagnetic patterns of the planet's surface. But in the moment, she simply flickered into visibility like a ghost made solid—tall, angular, unmistakably other.*

*The child should have screamed. Should have run. Should have done any of the thousand things that prey animals did when confronted with predators.*

*Instead, she looked up at Inanna with eyes the color of Earth's soil after rain, and held out a piece of bread.*

*"You look hungry," the child said. "Your eyes are sad like hungry."*

*Inanna had stood frozen, her translation implant struggling with the crude dialect, her social protocols offering no guidance for this scenario. She wasn't hungry—Anunnaki physiology didn't process sustenance the way humans did. She could survive for decades on the ambient energy harvested by her cellular structure.*

*But the child didn't know that. The child saw only another being, alone at the edge of things, and offered the only gift she had.*

*Inanna took the bread.*

*It tasted like nothing her body could process—rough, grainy, faintly bitter. It sat in her stomach like a stone, her digestive system uncertain what to do with solid matter. She would spend the next three days purging the foreign material from her system, her body treating the bread like an infection to be eliminated.*

*She ate every bite.*

*"I'm Mira," the child said, as if sharing food with beings from the sky was an ordinary occurrence. "What's your name?"*

*"Inanna," she heard herself say, violating six different protocols with a single word.*

*The child smiled—a expression Inanna had only seen in clinical studies of human behavior, never directed at her, never carrying this particular warmth. "That's pretty. Like music."*

*They sat together until the sun began its descent, Mira chattering about her life in the settlement, about her mother who worked in the mineral processing facility, about her dreams of seeing the great cities that the sky people had built. Inanna listened, her translation implant working overtime, her heart—or the Anunnaki equivalent—doing something it had never done before.*

*Breaking.*

*When the overseers' patrol drones appeared on the horizon, Inanna fled back to her pod. She never saw Mira again. Three years later, a mining accident—the official term for culling operations that eliminated inefficient populations—erased the entire settlement from existence.*

*But she never forgot the taste of that bread. The weight of that gift. The impossible generosity of a creature who had almost nothing, offering half of it to a stranger.*

---

Inanna opened her eyes. The neural archive chamber materialized around her again, cold and sterile, humming its subliminal song. Her cheeks were wet—an autonomic response she'd thought she'd evolved beyond centuries ago.

She pressed her palm to the crystalline interface.

"Archive access," she whispered. "Genetic design protocols. Authorization: Inanna, Second Daughter of Anu."

The crystal pulsed red. *Access denied. Restricted by order of the Primary.*

Of course. Her father's paranoia extended even here, to the historical records of his own creations.

But Inanna hadn't come unprepared.

She reached into her robe and withdrew a small device—a gift from her brother, passed to her in secret during the last council session. Enki's voice echoed in her memory: *"If you're determined to do this, at least be smart about it. This will mask your access signature, make it look like routine archive maintenance. You'll have maybe ten minutes before the system notices the anomaly."*

Ten minutes to find the truth about what humanity really was.

Ten minutes to discover whether her compassion had been spent on creatures designed for slaughter.

Inanna attached the device to the interface and watched the crystal shift from red to amber to green.

*Access granted.*

The chamber filled with light, and the secrets of humanity's creation began to unfold before her like a flower made of data and damnation.

**Scene 1: Young Inanna, approximately tw...**

**Scene 1: Young Inanna, approximately twelve years old in Anunnaki terms...**

The transport pod descended through amber clouds of dust, its anti-gravity dampeners humming with a frequency that made Inanna's teeth ache. She gripped the crystalline control orb tighter, watching the holographic altitude display count down the final hundred meters.

*Eighty. Sixty. Forty.*

Her hearts—both of them—hammered against her ribs in syncopated rhythm. If the survey vessel detected her absence before she returned, if anyone checked the auxiliary hangar bay logs, if Father somehow learned—

*Twenty. Ten.*

The pod touched down with barely a whisper, settling behind a formation of rust-colored boulders that rose like broken fingers toward the pale sky. Inanna released the breath she'd been holding and pressed her palm against the exit seal.

Hot air rushed in, carrying scents she had no names for. Mineral and organic, sharp and sweet, layered together in ways the recycled atmosphere of the orbital stations never achieved. She inhaled deeply, feeling the unfamiliar weight of unfiltered gravity pressing against her small frame. The environmental reports called Earth's surface "hostile to prolonged Anunnaki exposure," but to Inanna, it felt alive in a way the sterile corridors of home never did.

She climbed out of the pod, her silver-white robes immediately catching dust at the hem. The fabric was too fine for this place, too obviously foreign, but she'd had no time to find anything else. The orbital survey would complete its arc in two standard hours. She had to see them. Had to know if they were real.

The rocks provided adequate cover as she crept forward, her bare feet—she'd kicked off her ceremonial slippers inside the pod—finding purchase on the warm, gritty stone. The sounds reached her before the sight did: rhythmic clanging, grunts of exertion, the scrape of crude tools against harder earth.

Inanna pressed herself against the largest boulder and peered around its edge.

The mining settlement sprawled across a shallow valley, a wound carved into the red-brown landscape. Structures that could barely be called shelters dotted the perimeter—frameworks of salvaged metal and stretched hide, offering minimal protection from the merciless sun that blazed overhead. Trenches cut geometric patterns into the ground, their depths hidden in shadow, and from those depths emerged figures covered in dust the color of dried blood.

*Humans.*

She had seen them before, of course. Everyone had. The observation feeds displayed them constantly—productivity metrics, population counts, extraction quotas rendered in cold numerical precision. But the feeds showed them as objects, as units of labor measured against units of output.

They didn't show *this.*

A woman emerged from the nearest trench, hauling a basket of ore that seemed far too heavy for her thin frame. Her skin, where it wasn't caked with dust, showed the deep bronze of prolonged sun exposure. Her hair hung in matted ropes down her back. She moved with mechanical exhaustion, each step a negotiation with a body pushed beyond reasonable limits.

But her eyes—Inanna caught a glimpse of them as the woman turned—her eyes held something that the productivity reports never mentioned. Awareness. Thought. The same spark that Inanna saw when she looked in her own reflection.

More workers emerged, forming a line that snaked toward a processing station where overseers in the gleaming armor of the Igigi—the Anunnaki's lesser servants—tallied the haul with dispassionate efficiency. The humans moved in silence, their gazes fixed on the ground, shoulders curved inward as if trying to make themselves smaller, less noticeable.

A child caught Inanna's attention.

She couldn't have been more than five or six cycles old, small even by human standards, with a tangle of dark hair and limbs that seemed too long for her body. She wasn't working—too young yet for the trenches—but she wasn't playing either. She sat in the shade of one of the crude shelters, using a stick to draw patterns in the dust.

Circles, Inanna realized. The child was drawing circles within circles, the same sacred geometry that decorated the temples of Nibiru.

How could she know?

Inanna leaned forward, trying to see better, and her elbow dislodged a small cascade of pebbles.

The sound was barely audible over the ambient noise of the settlement, but the child's head snapped up instantly, her eyes—dark and deep as the space between stars—fixing on the exact spot where Inanna hid.

For a long moment, neither of them moved.

Then the child smiled.

It was such a small thing, that smile. A slight curving of cracked lips, a softening around those watchful eyes. But it struck Inanna like a physical blow, filling her chest with an emotion she couldn't name.

The child raised one dust-covered hand and waved.

Inanna's own hand rose before she could stop it, fingers spreading in an answering gesture. The movement felt forbidden, felt dangerous, felt *right* in a way that nothing in her carefully regulated life ever had.

A horn sounded from the processing station—shift change, perhaps, or a quota announcement—and the child's attention snapped away. She scrambled to her feet and ran toward the woman with the ore basket, who had set down her burden and was kneeling to receive the small body that launched itself into her arms.

Mother and daughter. The realization settled into Inanna's mind with unexpected weight.

They loved each other. These creatures that the Council called "biological tools," these engineered workers that her father dismissed as "slightly more sophisticated than the mining drones"—they *loved* each other.

Inanna stayed hidden behind her boulder until the sun began its descent toward the distant mountains, watching the settlement's rhythms of labor and rest, of hardship and small kindnesses. She watched humans share water from communal vessels, watched them touch each other's shoulders in passing, watched them gather as the light faded to eat whatever meager rations the Igigi distributed.

She watched, and something inside her shifted—a tectonic movement of the soul that she wouldn't fully understand for centuries to come.

When she finally crept back to her pod and lifted off into the darkening sky, the child's smile stayed with her, burning behind her eyes like a small, persistent star.

The orbital survey vessel was exactly where she'd left it, her absence apparently unnoticed. As Inanna guided her pod back into the auxiliary hangar, she made herself a promise.

She would come back. She would learn more. She would find out why these creatures—these *people*—affected her so deeply when everyone she'd ever known treated them as nothing more than convenient labor.

She didn't know, then, that this moment would define the rest of her existence. Didn't know that a single wave from a human child would plant a seed of rebellion that would take millennia to bloom.

All she knew, as she slipped back into her quarters and pretended she had never left, was that the universe had become larger than she'd ever imagined—and far more complicated.

**Scene 2: A starving human child, no old...**

**Scene 2: A starving human child, no older than five...**

Young Inanna pressed her back against the rough-hewn rock, her hearts hammering in tandem against her ribs. The excavation pile smelled of copper and something else—something organic and warm that she would later learn was the scent of human suffering baked into the very earth.

She should not be here.

The thought pulsed through her mind like a warning beacon, but she couldn't bring herself to activate the recall signal on her wrist. Not yet. Not when everything around her was so *different* from the sterile corridors of the orbital station.

Above, the sky stretched in an impossible blue, unmarred by the familiar curve of viewing ports. Wind—actual wind, not recycled atmospheric currents—stirred the fine hairs at her temples. And everywhere, *everywhere*, there was texture and chaos and life in forms her tutors had never shown her.

A sound. Small. Close.

Inanna froze, her luminescent eyes dimming instinctively—a predator's reflex, though her people had long since evolved beyond the need for such things. She peered around the edge of the rock pile.

A human child stood three meters away, watching her.

He was small—impossibly small, she thought, for a creature that was supposed to be a laborer. His skin stretched tight over visible ribs, the color of the red-brown earth that stained his bare feet. Sores marked his arms. His eyes, though—his eyes were enormous in his gaunt face, dark as the void between stars, and they held no fear.

That was wrong. Her tutors had assured her that humans feared the Anunnaki instinctively, that their primitive brains recognized superior beings and responded with appropriate submission. This child simply... looked at her.

*Run*, she willed him silently. *Run away, little creature, before someone sees.*

The child took a step forward.

Inanna's hand flew to her recall beacon. One press and she would be extracted, transported back to the shuttle hidden in the hills, and this moment would become nothing but a disciplinary hearing and a black mark on her family's reputation.

But the child had stopped. He was reaching into a fold of the rough fabric wrapped around his waist, pulling something out. A container—crude ceramic, chipped at the edges. He held it toward her with both hands, arms trembling with the effort.

"Eat," he said.

The word was simple, barely formed, spoken in the pidgin language the overseers had designed for giving commands. But he wasn't receiving a command. He was *giving* something.

Inanna found herself moving forward despite every protocol, every warning, every lesson about contamination and proper distance from the labor stock. She knelt in the red dust, bringing herself to his level, and looked into the container.

Grain paste. Gray-brown and congealed, flecked with grit. A single day's ration, she knew from her studies—barely enough to keep a worker functional, never enough to keep them healthy. And this child, this starving creature with his visible bones and weeping sores, was offering it to *her*.

"No," she whispered, pushing the container back toward him. "You need this. You—" She didn't know the words in his language. She wasn't sure she knew them in her own.

The child's brow furrowed. He pushed the container forward again, more insistently. "Eat," he repeated. Then, haltingly, with the careful pronunciation of a phrase learned by rote: "You... are... small. Small ones... need food."

*He thinks I'm a child like him.*

The realization crashed through Inanna like a solar flare. He saw her diminutive stature—young even by Anunnaki standards—and his first thought, his only thought, was that she might be hungry.

She was not hungry. She had never been hungry. She had never known a moment of want in her entire privileged existence. And this creature, this being her people had engineered for labor and disposal, was offering her everything he had.

Her eyes burned. Moisture gathered at their corners—an autonomic response she had only read about, never experienced. The humans called it *crying*.

"Why?" she asked, though she knew he couldn't understand the question.

The child smiled. It transformed his face, that smile—pushed past the gauntness and the sores and the exhaustion to reveal something luminous underneath. Something that had no right to exist in a being designed for nothing but servitude.

He pointed at her, then at himself, then pressed his small hand against his chest. "Same," he said. "Same inside."

The recall beacon on her wrist began to pulse. Red. Urgent. They had detected her absence, tracked her biosignature. In moments, the extraction team would arrive.

Inanna reached out and closed the child's fingers around his food container. "Keep it," she said, knowing he wouldn't understand the words but hoping—desperately, foolishly hoping—that he would understand the intent. "Keep it and *live*."

She pressed her palm against his forehead, feeling the fever-heat of his skin, the flutter of his pulse beneath her touch. Memorizing him. This moment. This impossible gift from a being who had nothing.

"I'm sorry," she whispered. "I'm so sorry for what we've done to you."

The child's smile never wavered.

The extraction beam caught her then, yanking her upward in a column of white light. The last thing she saw was the human child waving goodbye with one hand, clutching his grain paste with the other, still smiling at the strange small creature who had appeared and vanished like a spirit from the rocks.

She never learned his name.

She never forgot his face.

And as the shuttle carried her back toward the cold perfection of the orbital station, young Inanna of the House of Anu pressed her hands against the viewing port and watched the mining settlement shrink to a speck below. Somewhere down there, a child was eating his meager ration, unaware that he had just shattered everything she had ever been taught about the nature of humanity.

*Same inside.*

The words would haunt her for centuries. They would drive her to the forbidden archives, to questions that had no safe answers, to a rebellion that would cost her everything.

But that was still to come.

For now, there was only the memory of a smile, and the first fragile stirrings of something her people had tried to breed out of themselves long ago.

Compassion.

**Scene 3: In the present day, adult Inan...**

The memory of the child's face dissolved like morning mist over Earth's mountains, replaced by the cold luminescence of bioluminescent panels lining the corridor. Inanna blinked, steadying herself against the curved wall of the orbital station. Her fingers pressed into the living metal, feeling its subtle pulse—the heartbeat of Anunnaki engineering that had sustained their civilization for millennia.

*Mira.* The name surfaced unbidden. She had never learned if the child survived the winter that followed their encounter. Never dared to check.

Inanna straightened her spine and resumed walking, her ceremonial robes whispering against the floor with each measured step. The corridor narrowed as she descended toward the station's lower tiers, where the lighting shifted from welcoming gold to cautionary amber. Warning colors. Boundaries meant to discourage casual wandering.

She had wandered here deliberately for the past three cycles, mapping patrol rotations, noting which access points remained unmonitored during shift changes. The Watchers were thorough, but they were also creatures of habit—a weakness Inanna had learned to exploit.

The air grew cooler as she approached the junction where the main arterial corridor split into three branches. The left passage led to atmospheric processing. The right descended further toward the engineering cores. The center path, marked with faded glyphs that translated roughly to "Origin Archives," was her destination.

A figure emerged from the shadows ahead, and Inanna's hand instinctively moved toward the ceremonial blade concealed in her sleeve before recognition flooded through her.

"You're late," Enki said, his voice barely above a whisper. Her brother's typically immaculate appearance showed signs of strain—his silver-threaded hair slightly disheveled, his robes creased as though he'd been pacing for hours. The perpetual calm that usually masked his features had cracked, revealing something that looked dangerously close to fear.

"The Council session extended," Inanna replied, matching his hushed tone. "Father wanted additional reports on the surface contamination levels."

Enki flinched at the mention of their father. "And what did you tell him?"

"What he wanted to hear. That the humans continue to poison their own nest. That intervention may soon become necessary." The words tasted like ash in her mouth. "What choice did I have?"

"The same choice we all have. The same choice we never make." Enki glanced over his shoulder at the darkened corridor behind him. "We shouldn't be here, Inanna. If anyone discovers—"

"Then we'll be quick." She stepped closer, close enough to see the fine tremor in her brother's hands. Enki had always been the nervous one, the child who questioned everything but acted on nothing. Their father called it weakness. Inanna had come to recognize it as something else entirely—a conscience that had never quite been bred out of him. "Did you bring what I asked?"

Enki hesitated, his amber eyes—so like their father's, so unlike the cold calculation behind Anu's gaze—searching her face. "You understand what you're asking me to do? These files are classified at the highest levels. Not even the Council has full access. If Father learns I've bypassed his security protocols—"

"He won't learn. Not unless you tell him."

"That's not fair."

"None of this is fair." Inanna felt the old anger rising, the fury she'd carried since that day on the mountainside when a starving child had offered her half of everything she had. "What they've done to those people—what *we've* done—fairness ceased to be relevant long ago."

A sound echoed from somewhere above them—footsteps, perhaps, or merely the station's endless mechanical breathing. Both siblings froze, pressed against the corridor wall, waiting. The seconds stretched into an eternity of held breath and racing hearts.

The sound faded.

Enki exhaled shakily and reached into his robes, withdrawing a crystalline data chip that pulsed with soft blue light. "The access codes are embedded. They'll give you approximately twelve minutes before the system recognizes the intrusion and alerts security. I've programmed a false trail that should buy you time to escape, but Inanna—" He gripped her wrist as she reached for the chip. "Whatever you find in there, whatever truth you're searching for, it won't change anything. Father's mind is made. The others on the Council follow his lead without question. One voice of dissent, even yours, won't—"

"I don't want to dissent." Inanna pulled her wrist free and took the chip. It was warm against her palm, alive with stolen secrets. "I want to understand. Before I can act, I need to know exactly what we created. What vulnerabilities we built into them." She paused, studying her brother's anguished expression. "You designed them, Enki. You know better than anyone what they truly are."

Something shifted in Enki's face—guilt, perhaps, or the shadow of an old pride he'd never fully extinguished. "I know what they were supposed to be. Workers. Tools. Biological machines sophisticated enough to mine the resources we needed but simple enough to control." His voice dropped lower still. "But creation has a way of exceeding its creator's intentions. I watched them, Inanna. In those early generations, before the Watchers established the non-interference protocols. I watched them discover fire. Watched them bury their dead with flowers. Watched them paint images on cave walls—not because they were programmed to, but because something in them *needed* to create."

"And Father?"

"Father saw the same things I did. He drew different conclusions." Enki's hands clenched at his sides. "He saw a threat. A species that might one day look up at the stars and ask questions we weren't prepared to answer."

The chip pulsed in Inanna's grip, its light reflecting off the corridor walls like a tiny captured star. "That's why I need to access the archives. The genetic specifications, the original design parameters—there's something you're not telling me, brother. Something everyone on the Council knows but never speaks aloud."

Enki's silence was answer enough.

"Tell me," Inanna pressed.

"The archives will show you." He stepped back, already retreating into the shadows from which he'd emerged. "Twelve minutes, Inanna. Don't waste them asking questions you're about to answer yourself." He paused at the corridor's edge, his form half-dissolved into darkness. "And sister? Whatever you decide to do with what you learn... I hope you're braver than I am."

Then he was gone, leaving Inanna alone with the weight of stolen access codes and the growing certainty that what waited in those archives would change everything.

She turned toward the vault door at the corridor's end—a massive slab of living metal inscribed with warnings in their ancient tongue. *Restricted. Authorized Personnel Only. By Order of the High Council.*

Twelve minutes.

Inanna pressed the chip against the access panel and watched the warnings dissolve, replaced by the soft green glow of acceptance.

The door began to open.

**Scene 4: Inside the genetic archives, I...**

Inside the genetic archives, Inanna felt the weight of forbidden knowledge pressing against her chest like a physical force. The chamber stretched before them in impossible dimensions—a cathedral of light and data that hummed with the collected genetic memory of a thousand worlds. Crystalline columns rose toward a ceiling lost in darkness, each one containing the encoded essence of species both living and extinct.

"Stay close," Enki whispered, his fingers dancing across a translucent control interface. "The archive's monitoring systems cycle every forty-three seconds. I've created a blind spot, but it won't hold indefinitely."

Inanna nodded, her eyes adjusting to the ethereal blue glow that permeated everything. Holographic strands of genetic code floated through the air like luminescent serpents, twisting and recombining in patterns too complex for any but the most trained minds to interpret. The air itself tasted of ozone and something older—the metallic tang of creation itself.

"Access point seven," Enki murmured, leading her deeper into the maze of floating data. "The human genome is stored in the restricted section, naturally. Father always did enjoy his little hierarchies of secrecy."

They passed through a membrane of light that made Inanna's skin tingle, and suddenly they stood at the heart of the archive. Here, the genetic models were larger, more detailed—each one representing a species that had been engineered rather than evolved. She recognized several: the Igigi laborers with their enhanced strength and diminished will, the Anzu warriors bred for nothing but combat, the Apkallu who served as intermediaries between their kind and lesser beings.

And there, suspended in a column of golden light, was humanity.

Inanna stepped forward, her breath catching. The human genome spiraled before her in exquisite detail, each chromosome rendered as a ribbon of pure information. It was beautiful—achingly so. She could see the elegant architecture of their design, the careful balance of intelligence and emotion, the capacity for both creation and destruction woven into every strand.

"Magnificent, isn't it?" Enki's voice carried a note of pride he couldn't quite suppress. "My finest work, though I'm not supposed to say so. Father wanted workers—strong, compliant, disposable. I gave him that, but I also gave them..." He trailed off, gesturing at a cluster of genes that pulsed with subtle radiance. "Potential."

"Show me everything," Inanna said. "I need to understand what we've done to them."

Enki hesitated, his silver eyes reflecting the cascading data streams. Then he sighed and expanded the holographic display with a sweep of his hand. The human genome exploded outward, filling the space around them with intricate detail. Inanna found herself standing inside the very blueprint of humanity, surrounded by the building blocks of their existence.

"Here," Enki said, highlighting a sequence near what humans would call chromosome twelve. "This is the standard obedience protocol—a predisposition toward hierarchy and submission to authority. It's subtle, nothing that would override free will entirely, but enough to make them... manageable."

Inanna studied the sequence, her jaw tightening. She'd suspected something like this, but seeing it rendered in precise genetic code made it horrifyingly real. "And they have no idea."

"How could they? They think their social structures, their religions, their governments—they believe these emerge from their own nature. And in a way, they do. We simply... nudged that nature in useful directions."

"What else?"

Enki manipulated the display, bringing up another sequence. "Shortened telomeres. Their natural lifespan could be five times what it is, but Father wanted them to cycle quickly. Easier to control populations that don't accumulate too much wisdom." He paused, something flickering across his features. "I tried to compensate where I could. Gave them creativity, adaptability, emotional depth. Things Father didn't ask for and wouldn't have approved if he'd noticed."

Inanna moved through the holographic strands, her fingers passing through genetic sequences that represented millions of human lives. Each one a person with hopes, fears, loves, losses—reduced to nothing more than code to be written and rewritten at their creators' whim.

"There's something else," she said quietly. "Something you're not showing me."

Enki's hand froze over the interface. "Inanna—"

"Don't." She turned to face him, and the light from the holographic display cast strange shadows across her features. "I didn't risk everything to come here for half-truths. If you want to help me, then help me. Otherwise, step aside and let me find it myself."

For a long moment, her brother said nothing. The archive hummed around them, indifferent to the weight of the decision hanging in the air. Then Enki closed his eyes and made a gesture that seemed to pain him physically.

The display shifted. Contracted. Focused on a single sequence buried deep within the human genome—a cluster of genes that pulsed with a sickly amber light, distinctly different from the healthy blue glow of the surrounding code.

"We call it the Tiamat Protocol," Enki said, his voice barely above a whisper. "Named for the primordial chaos. Father's insurance policy against the day his creations might become... inconvenient."

Inanna stared at the sequence, her mind racing to interpret what she was seeing. The genes were interlocked in a pattern she'd never encountered before—a closed loop that seemed to serve no biological function whatsoever. "What does it do?"

"Nothing. Under normal circumstances, absolutely nothing. The sequence is dormant, invisible to their own scientists. But it's designed to respond to a very specific stimulus." Enki pulled up a secondary display showing a waveform pattern. "This frequency. Transmitted at sufficient power, it would reach every human on Earth within hours. The signal activates the dormant sequence, which then begins producing a protein that attacks cellular structure at the mitochondrial level."

The holographic display shifted again, showing a simulation. Inanna watched in growing horror as the human cells began to break down, their internal structures collapsing like buildings in an earthquake. The process was rapid, efficient, and utterly devastating.

"How long?" she asked, though she wasn't sure she wanted to know.

"From activation to complete cellular breakdown? Seventy-two hours for most individuals. The young and elderly would go faster. Within a week, there wouldn't be a living human left on Earth." Enki's voice had gone flat, clinical—the defense mechanism of a scientist confronting the monstrous implications of his own work. "No plague, no weapon, no natural disaster. Just... silence. And then we would be free to start again with a more compliant design."

Inanna felt the chamber spin around her. She reached out to steady herself against one of the crystalline columns, and the data streams parted around her hand like frightened fish. The face of the human child from her memory flashed before her eyes—those dark eyes full of trust, that small hand offering her a piece of bread that represented everything he had.

"You built this," she said, and her voice came out strangled. "You designed them with their own extinction coded into every cell."

"I was ordered to include failsafes. All our engineered species have them." Enki couldn't meet her eyes. "The Igigi have a similar protocol, as do the Anzu. It's standard procedure for—"

"Standard procedure?" Inanna whirled on him, and the archive's ambient light seemed to flicker in response to her rage. "We're talking about eight billion lives, Enki. Eight billion people who have built civilizations, created art, loved and lost and dreamed of touching the stars. And you've given our father a way to erase them all with the push of a button."

"I didn't have a choice!"

"There's always a choice!" The words echoed through the cathedral space, bouncing off crystalline columns and data streams. Somewhere in the distance, an alarm began to pulse—soft but insistent.

Enki grabbed her arm. "Keep your voice down. The monitoring systems—"

"Let them hear me." But even as she said it, Inanna forced herself to take a breath, to pull back from the edge of her fury. Rage wouldn't save anyone. Only action could do that.

She turned back to the holographic display, studying the Tiamat Protocol with new eyes. "Can it be removed? Edited out of their genome?"

"Not without Father noticing. The protocol is monitored separately, checked against baseline readings every cycle. Any attempt to alter it would trigger an immediate alert."

"What about blocking the signal? Preventing it from reaching them?"

Enki shook his head. "The frequency is designed to penetrate any shielding they could construct with their current technology. It would require equipment they won't develop for another thousand years, assuming they survive that long."

Inanna stared at the amber-pulsing sequence, her mind racing through possibilities and discarding them one by one. There had to be a way. There was always a way.

"Then we warn them," she said finally. "We give them the information they need to save themselves."

"Inanna, that would be—"

"Treason. Yes. I know." She turned to face her brother, and something in her expression made him take a step back. "I've spent centuries pretending I don't see what we are, Enki. What we do. I've told myself that the humans are lesser, that their suffering doesn't matter, that Father knows best. But I can't pretend anymore. Not after what I've seen here."

The alarm's pulse was growing stronger now, more insistent. They were running out of time.

"I need copies of everything," Inanna said. "The protocol specifications, the trigger frequency, the cellular breakdown simulation. Everything you can give me."

"If you're caught with this information—"

"Then I'll face the consequences." She gripped his arm, forcing him to look at her. "Help me, brother. Please. You designed them with potential for a reason. Give them the chance to fulfill it."

Enki stared at her for a long moment, conflict warring openly across his features. Then, with hands that trembled slightly, he began transferring data to a crystalline storage chip. "This contains everything. The protocol, the frequency, the timeline for cellular breakdown. It also includes..." He hesitated. "It includes some of my personal notes. Research I've done over the centuries. Ways the protocol might theoretically be countered, given sufficient technological advancement."

Inanna took the chip, feeling its weight—so small to contain the fate of a species. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet." Enki's expression was haunted. "Father has been meeting with the Council more frequently lately. There are rumors that he's growing impatient with humanity's development—their wars, their environmental destruction, their stubborn refusal to remain in their designated role. If he decides to activate the protocol..."

"How much time do we have?"

"I don't know. Weeks, maybe. Months if we're lucky." The alarm shifted pitch, becoming more urgent. "You need to go. Now. I'll cover your access here, but if you're found in the restricted section—"

"I understand." Inanna tucked the chip into a hidden fold of her garment. "Enki... why did you do it? Give them more than Father asked for?"

Her brother was silent for a moment, his eyes distant. "Because I looked at them, really looked, and I saw... possibility. They're flawed, yes. Violent and short-sighted and capable of terrible cruelty. But they're also capable of such beauty, such courage, such love. I thought..." He shook his head. "I thought maybe, if given enough time, they might become something worthy of the potential I gave them. Something that could stand beside us as equals rather than beneath us as slaves."

"And now?"

"Now I don't know." He met her eyes, and she saw the depth of his anguish. "All I know is that I can't be the one to decide their fate. I'm not brave enough to save them, Inanna. But maybe... maybe you are."

The alarm reached a crescendo, and the archive's ambient light began to shift toward red. Inanna squeezed her brother's hand once, then turned and ran toward the exit, the crystal chip burning against her chest like a coal.

Behind her, Enki watched her go, and if there were tears on his cheeks, the archive's shifting light made them impossible to see.

**Scene 5: Inanna confronts Enki about hi...**

The observation deck hung suspended over nothing, a crystalline blister protruding from the station's underbelly. Inanna stood at its center, her bare feet pressing against the transparent floor, Earth rotating slowly beneath her like a living jewel. Clouds swirled over the Pacific, painting white spirals against impossible blue.

She heard him before she saw him—the soft shuffle of reluctant footsteps, the whisper of robes against polished metal.

"You shouldn't have accessed those files." Enki's voice carried no accusation, only exhaustion. "The system flagged your intrusion. I had to purge the logs myself."

Inanna didn't turn. "Then you know what I found."

Silence stretched between them, filled only by the station's ambient hum and the distant pulse of recycled air. Enki moved to stand beside her, his reflection ghosting across the floor—tall, gaunt, with eyes that held the weight of centuries.

"The Terminus Protocol," he said finally. "You found the kill switch."

"I found *your* kill switch." Now she turned, and the accusation in her eyes made him flinch. "Your genetic signature is embedded in the code, Enki. You designed it. You built the very thing that will murder them."

Below them, Earth continued its patient rotation, indifferent to the conversation that might determine its children's fate. The terminator line crept across Asia, cities winking to life like scattered embers.

Enki's hands trembled as he pressed them against the observation glass. "You think I don't know what I've done? You think I sleep peacefully knowing that every human child born carries my death sentence written into their cells?"

"Then why?" Inanna's voice cracked. "How could you create something so beautiful and then—" She gestured at the planet below, at the lights of ten billion lives. "How could you give them the capacity to love, to dream, to create art and music and *hope*, knowing you'd built their destruction into their very DNA?"

Enki's composure shattered. He sank to his knees on the transparent floor, Earth glowing beneath him like a judgment. When he looked up at his sister, tears traced silver paths down his angular cheeks.

"Because Father ordered it," he whispered. "Because I was afraid. Because I am a coward, Inanna. I have always been a coward."

She knelt beside him, the cold floor biting into her knees. "Tell me everything."

He drew a shuddering breath. "When Father commissioned the human project, his specifications were... limited. He wanted workers. Biological machines capable of mining, of construction, of serving our needs without question. Intelligent enough to follow complex orders, but not intelligent enough to resist them."

"But you gave them more."

"I gave them *everything*." A broken laugh escaped him. "I couldn't help myself. The genetic architecture was so elegant, so full of possibility. Every time I tried to limit their potential, it felt like... like carving the wings off a butterfly and calling it improvement."

Enki's hand pressed flat against the floor, fingers splayed as if trying to touch the world below. "I gave them curiosity that would never be satisfied. Imagination that could reshape reality. The capacity for love so profound it could overcome their fear of death. I gave them the ability to look up at the stars and *wonder*."

"Father must have noticed."

"Of course he noticed." Bitterness crept into Enki's voice. "He was furious. Called me before the Council, demanded I explain why our workers were painting images on cave walls instead of mining ore. Why they were burying their dead with flowers. Why they were asking *questions*."

Inanna remembered those early days—the confusion among the Anunnaki as their simple servants began exhibiting behaviors no one had anticipated. The first human to look at the sky and name the stars. The first to refuse an order.

"He wanted me to redesign them," Enki continued. "Strip out the excess potential, reduce them to what he'd originally specified. I told him it was impossible—that the traits were too deeply integrated, that removing them would collapse the entire genetic structure."

"Was that true?"

Enki's silence was answer enough.

"So the kill switch was the compromise," Inanna said slowly. "He let you keep your beautiful creation, as long as you gave him a way to destroy it."

"If they ever became a threat. If they ever evolved beyond our control. If they ever..." He swallowed hard. "If they ever realized what they truly were."

Inanna stood abruptly, pacing the observation deck. Her reflection multiplied in the curved walls, a dozen versions of herself moving in agitated synchrony. "And now Father believes that time has come. He's going to activate it."

"The Council vote is in three rotations. He has the majority."

"Then help me stop it." She spun to face him, fierce hope blazing in her eyes. "You designed the kill switch—you can disable it. We can go to Earth, warn them, give them a chance to—"

"To what?" Enki rose slowly, his robes pooling around him like spilled shadow. "Fight us? They're children playing with fire, Inanna. They've barely discovered nuclear fission. Their most advanced spacecraft can't escape their own gravity well. What chance would they have against the Anunnaki?"

"At least they'd have a *choice*. At least they could die fighting instead of—" She stopped, struggling to find words for the horror of it. "Instead of simply... switching off. Like machines. Like they never mattered at all."

Enki reached for her hands, and she let him take them. His fingers were cold, trembling. "I've spent millennia watching them, sister. I've seen their cruelty, their wars, their capacity for destruction. But I've also seen..." His voice broke. "I've seen mothers die for children who weren't their own. I've seen strangers risk everything to save each other. I've seen them create beauty that makes my hearts ache."

"Then stand with me."

The words hung in the recycled air, a bridge waiting to be crossed.

Enki released her hands and stepped back. The distance between them felt suddenly vast, unbridgeable. "I can't."

"Can't or won't?"

"Does it matter?" He turned away, unable to meet her eyes. "Father would destroy me, Inanna. Not exile—destruction. Complete molecular dissolution. And even if I could face that, even if I could find that courage... I would fail. I've always failed when it mattered most. I'm not like you."

Inanna felt something cold settle in her chest—not anger, but something worse. Acceptance. "No. You're not."

"I can give you information," he said quickly, desperately. "Access codes, genetic sequences, anything you need. But I cannot stand beside you openly. I cannot—"

"You cannot risk yourself." She kept her voice carefully neutral. "I understand."

"Inanna—"

"I said I understand." She moved past him toward the deck's exit, then paused at the threshold. Earth glowed behind her, painting her silhouette in blue and white. "The girl I met, all those centuries ago. The one who shared her food with me. She had nothing, Enki. She was starving, and still she gave half of everything she had to a stranger."

Enki said nothing.

"They're better than us," Inanna said softly. "That's what Father is really afraid of. Not that they'll threaten us—that they'll *surpass* us. That his engineered servants will prove more worthy of existence than their creators."

She stepped through the doorway, then looked back one final time. Her brother stood alone on the observation deck, a dark figure suspended above the world he'd helped create and condemned to die.

"Send me the access codes," she said. "I'll do what needs to be done."

The door sealed behind her with a soft hiss, leaving Enki alone with Earth and his conscience. Inanna walked the empty corridor, her footsteps echoing against metal walls, and began to plan.

She had three rotations to save a species.

She had no allies, no resources, no authority.

She had only herself, and the memory of a child's smile, and a debt that had waited millennia to be repaid.

It would have to be enough.

**Scene 6: Alone in her private quarters,...**

Alone in her private quarters, Inanna pressed her palm against the cold viewport and watched Earth turn beneath her like a jewel suspended in darkness.

The planet's night side glittered with the scattered lights of human cities—millions of lives burning bright, unaware that somewhere in the orbital darkness above them, their extinction had already been scheduled. The terminator line crept across the Pacific, dawn chasing the shadows westward, and Inanna found herself counting the hours until that same sun might rise on a world emptied of human voices.

She pulled her hand away from the glass, leaving behind a faint impression of warmth that faded quickly in the climate-controlled air. Her quarters were spare by Anunnaki standards—a meditation alcove with cushions the color of deep water, a sleeping platform that adjusted to her biorhythms, and the viewport that dominated the far wall like a window into possibility. She had never cared for the ornate excesses that her siblings favored. Now, looking around the room that had been her sanctuary for three centuries, she realized how little of it she would miss.

The navigation console hummed to life at her touch, its holographic interface casting blue light across her features. Her fingers trembled slightly as she accessed the transit archives—not the official ones that logged every descent and ascent, but the older records from the early colonization period, when the monitoring systems had been less comprehensive.

"Display unmonitored approach vectors," she whispered. "Atmospheric entry corridors with sensor gaps greater than four minutes."

The console chirped a warning. *Access restricted. Authorization level insufficient.*

Inanna closed her eyes. She had known this moment would come—the point where she would have to cross from doubt into action, from thought-crime into actual treason. Her clearance codes could unlock the information, but the query itself would be logged. Someone would eventually notice.

Unless she used the override sequence Enki had given her years ago, back when he still believed she might join his research team. A gift between siblings, freely offered, never meant for this purpose.

*Forgive me, brother.*

She entered the sequence. The console's warning dissolved, replaced by a cascade of data—entry windows, sensor blind spots, patrol schedules. The information painted itself across the air before her, a map of possibilities where none had existed moments before.

There. A corridor over the South Atlantic, where two monitoring satellites had been decommissioned but never replaced. A four-hour window every thirty-two hours when a small craft could slip through undetected. The next window opened in eleven hours.

Inanna began downloading the coordinates to a personal data crystal, her movements mechanical, her mind already racing ahead to the next obstacle. She would need a craft—something small enough to evade detection, sturdy enough to survive atmospheric entry, simple enough that she could pilot it alone.

The emergency pods.

Every level of the station maintained them, relics of an evacuation protocol that had never been needed. They were designed for automated descent, programmed to deposit their passengers in predetermined safe zones. But the programming could be overwritten. The pods could be redirected.

She pulled up the maintenance schedule for the nearest pod bay. A diagnostic cycle was scheduled for tomorrow—the pods would be powered down, their tracking systems temporarily disabled for inspection. If she moved quickly, she could modify one before the technicians arrived.

The plan took shape in her mind like a constellation emerging from chaos. Descent through the unmonitored corridor. Landing in a remote region—somewhere the humans called South America, perhaps, where the population density was lower and her arrival might go unnoticed. Then... what? Find the humans, somehow. Warn them of what was coming.

The absurdity of it struck her like a physical blow. She was one Anunnaki against the entire Council, against her father's will, against millennia of established order. She didn't even know how to speak to humans, how to make them understand. The few words of their languages she had learned were archaic, remnants of the early contact period when the Anunnaki had still walked among their creations.

But she thought of the child in the ruins, the one who had offered her bread with dirty hands and a smile that expected nothing in return. If that capacity for grace existed in humanity, then perhaps they could be reached. Perhaps they could be saved.

Perhaps she had to try, even if trying meant losing everything.

Inanna moved to her personal console and activated the recording function. The small lens embedded in the wall caught her reflection—a woman who looked older than she had this morning, though her face remained unchanged. The aging was in her eyes, in the weight that had settled across her shoulders.

"Mother," she began, then stopped. The word felt strange in her mouth, too intimate for what she was about to say.

She started again. "Queen Antu. By the time you receive this message, I will have committed an act that our laws define as the highest treason. I will have descended to Earth without authorization. I will have attempted to warn the humans of their impending extinction."

The words came easier now, flowing like water finding its course downhill.

"I know what you will think. That I have been corrupted by sentiment, that I have forgotten my duty to our people, that I have betrayed everything you raised me to be. Perhaps all of that is true. But I have also remembered something that I believe we have forgotten—that creation carries responsibility, that power demands mercy, that the measure of a civilization is not in what it can destroy, but in what it chooses to protect."

She paused, gathering herself for what came next.

"I do not ask for your forgiveness. I do not expect you to understand. But I want you to know that this choice is mine, made freely, with full knowledge of its consequences. Whatever punishment the Council decrees, whatever fate awaits me, I accept it. I only ask that you remember me as I was before this moment—your daughter, who loved you, who tried to make you proud."

Inanna's voice cracked on the last words. She steadied herself, pressing her palms flat against the console.

"There was a human child, once. A girl with nothing, who gave me everything she had. I have carried that moment with me for two hundred years, Mother. I have tried to understand what it meant—what it means that a creature we designed for servitude could show more generosity than we have ever shown them. I think I finally understand now."

She looked directly at the recording lens, willing her mother to see her, truly see her, when this message finally played.

"It means we were wrong. About them. About ourselves. About everything."

The recording ended. Inanna encrypted the file with a time-delay protocol—it would transmit to her mother's private channel in twenty-four hours, long after she had either succeeded or failed in her descent. Long enough that no one could stop her.

She stood in the silence of her quarters, feeling the weight of what she had done settle into her bones. The die was cast. The path was chosen. There was no returning to the woman she had been this morning, the princess who had doubted but never acted, who had questioned but never defied.

That woman was dead now, killed by her own hand, buried in a recording that would damn her in the eyes of everyone she had ever known.

Inanna turned back to the viewport. Earth hung before her, beautiful and doomed, its billions of souls sleeping through their final days. Somewhere down there, in the ruins of a city she had never learned the name of, a girl had grown into a woman, had lived and loved and perhaps died, never knowing that her small act of kindness had planted a seed that would one day bloom into revolution.

*I'm coming,* Inanna thought, pressing her hand once more against the cold glass. *I don't know if I can save you. I don't know if anyone can. But I'm coming.*

Eleven hours until the window opened.

She had work to do.
