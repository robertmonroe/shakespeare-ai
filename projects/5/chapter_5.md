## Chapter 5: The Affair

**Scene 1: Max and Elena meet at the rent...**

# **Scene 1: Max and Elena meet at the rented apartment for the first time**

The apartment smelled of old wood and lemon polish. Max had chosen it carefully—third floor of a converted townhouse in the Altstadt, the kind of building where neighbors minded their own business and the landlord accepted cash without asking questions. Afternoon light slanted through the gauze curtains, painting amber stripes across the hardwood floor.

He checked his watch. Two minutes past three.

The knock came soft but deliberate. Three taps, a pause, then two more. Their agreed signal, though Max wondered if such precautions were theatrical or necessary. In his line of work, the line between paranoia and prudence had long since blurred.

Elena stood in the doorway wearing a charcoal coat buttoned to her throat, a silk scarf the color of winter sky draped loosely around her neck. Her dark hair was pinned up, exposing the elegant curve of her nape. She looked at him without speaking, her green eyes searching his face as if trying to read something written there in invisible ink.

"Come in," Max said, stepping aside.

She entered with measured steps, her gaze sweeping the sparse furnishings—a worn leather sofa, a small table with two chairs, a kitchenette barely large enough for one person. The bedroom door stood half-open beyond.

"It's not much," Max offered.

"It's perfect." Elena turned to face him, and he saw the slight tremor in her hands as she unbuttoned her coat. "No one knows about this place?"

"No one."

She let the coat slip from her shoulders. Beneath it she wore a simple cream blouse and dark trousers that accentuated her slim figure. Max caught the scent of her perfume—something subtle, bergamot and jasmine—as she moved closer.

"I almost didn't come," she said quietly.

"Why did you?"

Elena's lips curved into a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. "Because I'm tired of being careful. Tired of being what everyone expects." She reached up, pulled a pin from her hair. Dark waves tumbled down around her shoulders. "Because when I'm with you, I feel like I can breathe."

Max knew he should say something, maintain the careful distance that operational security demanded. Instead, he closed the space between them in two strides and cupped her face in his hands. Her skin was warm, impossibly soft. For a heartbeat they simply looked at each other, the weight of unspoken words hanging in the dusty afternoon light.

Then Elena rose on her toes and kissed him.

The kiss was tentative at first, almost questioning. But when Max responded, something shifted. Her fingers found the back of his neck, pulling him closer with surprising urgency. He tasted wine on her lips, felt the rapid flutter of her pulse beneath his thumb. The careful control she'd maintained at every previous meeting fell away like a discarded mask.

They moved toward the bedroom without breaking apart, a graceless dance of stumbling steps and grasping hands. Max's jacket hit the floor. Elena's blouse came unbuttoned with fumbling fingers—his, hers, he couldn't tell anymore. The bed was narrow, the sheets crisp and white, and when they fell onto it together the old frame creaked in protest.

What followed was intense, almost desperate. Elena kissed like she was trying to erase something, her hands exploring with a hunger that matched his own. Max lost himself in the taste of her skin, the sound of her breathing, the way she whispered his name like a confession.

But afterward, as they lay tangled in the sheets with the afternoon light fading toward evening, Max noticed things he hadn't before. The way Elena's fingers trembled slightly as she traced patterns on his chest. The hollow look that crept back into her eyes when she thought he wasn't watching. The tension that never quite left her shoulders, even in his arms.

"Are you all right?" he asked, brushing a strand of hair from her face.

Elena was quiet for a long moment. When she finally spoke, her voice was barely above a whisper. "I haven't felt this way in years. Like I'm actually here, actually present in my own life." She turned to look at him, and he saw tears gathering at the corners of her eyes. "Is that strange?"

"No." Max pulled her closer, feeling the steady rhythm of her heartbeat against his ribs. "Not strange at all."

She nestled into him, her breath warm against his neck. "Viktor will be in Frankfurt until tomorrow night. I told my driver I was shopping and meeting a friend for dinner. We have a few hours."

A few hours. Max's mind automatically calculated—time to plant the first listening device, to steer the conversation toward Viktor's business dealings, to begin the careful process of recruitment. That was why he was here, after all. The mission. The objective.

But Elena shifted in his arms, vulnerable and trusting, and something in Max's chest tightened uncomfortably.

"Then let's not waste them," he said, and meant it in ways that had nothing to do with tradecraft.

Elena lifted her head, studying his face with those intelligent green eyes. For a moment Max had the unsettling sensation that she could see right through him, past the cover story and the careful lies, down to something he'd almost forgotten existed.

"Max," she said softly. "Whatever this is between us—I need you to know it's real for me. Not just an escape. Real."

The words hung in the air like a challenge and a confession all at once.

"It's real for me too," Max heard himself say, and realized with a cold shock that he meant it.

Elena smiled then, a genuine smile that transformed her face, and kissed him again—slower this time, tender rather than desperate. Outside, church bells chimed the hour. The light continued to fade. And Max held her close, pushing away thoughts of surveillance equipment and mission parameters, choosing instead to exist in this moment, this lie that was becoming dangerously close to truth.

When they finally rose to dress, moving around each other with the careful intimacy of new lovers, Max caught sight of his reflection in the bedroom mirror. He looked the same as always—same face, same body, same practiced expressions.

But something fundamental had shifted, and he knew it.

Elena finished buttoning her blouse and turned to him, her expression serious. "Can we meet again? Soon?"

"Yes," Max said without hesitation. "Whenever you can."

She nodded, then hesitated, her hand on the doorframe. "There are things I need to tell you. About Viktor. About what he's involved in." Her voice dropped lower. "I know more than I should. More than is safe."

Max's pulse quickened, but he kept his expression neutral. "You don't have to—"

"I want to," Elena interrupted. "Not today. But soon. I think..." She paused, choosing her words carefully. "I think I've been waiting for someone I could trust. Someone who might understand."

She left before Max could respond, slipping out into the hallway with a final glance over her shoulder. Max listened to her footsteps descend the stairs, heard the building's front door open and close.

Then he was alone in the apartment, surrounded by afternoon shadows and the lingering scent of her perfume, wondering what the hell he'd just gotten himself into.

**Scene 2: During a quiet moment after th...**

**Scene 2: During a quiet moment after their encounter**

The afternoon light had shifted, turning amber as it filtered through the gauze curtains. Max lay on his back, one arm folded behind his head, listening to the sound of running water from the bathroom. Elena's clothes were scattered across the hardwood floor like evidence at a crime scene—her silk blouse draped over the chair, her skirt pooled near the doorway.

Her handbag sat on the nightstand, black leather gleaming in the slanted sunlight.

Max's pulse quickened, but not from desire this time. He sat up slowly, the sheets rustling beneath him. The water continued to run. He had maybe two minutes.

The listening device was already in his palm—he'd kept it there since she'd gone into the bathroom, a small disc no larger than a shirt button, matte black and feather-light. His fingers found the magnetic clasp of her bag without fumbling. Professional muscle memory. The interior smelled of expensive perfume and leather. He felt past her phone, her wallet, located the zippered pocket in the silk lining.

The device slipped in easily. His fingers withdrew. The clasp clicked shut.

The water stopped.

Max was back against the headboard by the time the bathroom door opened, his breathing steady, his expression carefully arranged into something between contentment and drowsiness. Elena emerged wrapped in one of the apartment's white towels, her dark hair damp against her shoulders. Without makeup, she looked younger. Vulnerable.

The guilt hit him like a fist to the sternum.

"You're still awake," she said, a small smile playing at her lips. "I thought you'd fallen asleep."

"Just thinking."

"Dangerous habit." She crossed to the window, adjusted the curtain slightly. A habit, Max had noticed—she was always aware of sightlines, of who might see in. "What about?"

"You," he said. It wasn't entirely a lie.

Elena turned, and for a moment something flickered across her face—pleasure mixed with something harder to name. Sadness, maybe. Or recognition. She moved to the bed, sat on the edge, the mattress dipping beneath her weight.

"Max." Her voice was quiet. "We should talk about what this is."

His chest tightened. "What do you want it to be?"

"I don't know." She traced a pattern on the sheet between them, not meeting his eyes. "I just know that when I'm here, I can breathe. When I'm home..." She trailed off.

This was his opening. Max knew it instinctively, the way a predator knows when prey has exposed its throat. He reached out, covered her hand with his. "Has something happened? You seem more tense than usual."

"Viktor's been different lately." The words came slowly, as if she were testing their weight. "More secretive. He's always on his phone, always having these meetings at odd hours."

"Business?" Max kept his voice neutral, sympathetic.

"Maybe." Elena's fingers curled into the sheet. "I don't know what kind of business requires meeting people at midnight in parking garages."

Max's heart rate spiked, but he kept his expression concerned, nothing more. "That does sound strange."

She looked at him then, really looked at him, and Max felt suddenly exposed, as if she could see straight through his carefully constructed cover to the operative beneath. Her eyes were the color of slate, and just as hard.

"You're easy to talk to," she said. "Has anyone ever told you that?"

"Once or twice."

"It's because you listen without judging. Or maybe..." She paused, her gaze sharpening. "Maybe because you're actually interested in what I have to say. Not just waiting for your turn to talk."

The observation was uncomfortably astute. Max shifted, aware of the listening device in her bag, aware of the surveillance camera hidden in the smoke detector above them, aware of the entire architecture of deception he'd built around this woman.

"I am interested," he said. And God help him, it was true.

Elena stood abruptly, moving back to her scattered clothes. She began dressing with quick, efficient movements. "I should go. Viktor will be back from Moscow tonight."

"Elena—"

"Don't." She pulled on her skirt, zipped it with a sharp sound. "Don't say whatever you're about to say. Not today."

Max watched her finish dressing, each garment a layer of armor going back on. When she reached for her handbag, his stomach clenched. She slung it over her shoulder without checking inside, thank God.

At the door, she paused. "Next week. Same time?"

"If you want to."

"I want to." She touched his face, her palm cool against his cheek. "You're a good man, Max Monroe. I hope that's not a lie."

Then she was gone, her footsteps fading down the stairs.

Max stood alone in the apartment, surrounded by the evidence of what they'd done—rumpled sheets, the lingering scent of her perfume, the ghost of her touch still warm on his skin. He thought about the device in her bag, already transmitting. He thought about the report he'd have to file, the intelligence he was gathering.

He thought about the look in her eyes when she'd said, *I hope that's not a lie.*

His phone buzzed. A text from Reeves: *Any progress?*

Max stared at the message for a long moment. Then he typed: *Working on it.*

He deleted three other versions before settling on those three words. They felt like a confession.

**Scene 3: Over wine in the apartment's s...**

**Scene 3: Over wine in the apartment's small kitchen**

The kitchen was barely large enough for two people to stand comfortably. Max leaned against the chipped porcelain sink while Elena sat on the single wooden stool, her legs crossed, one bare foot swinging gently in the dim light. The bottle of Bordeaux between them was half-empty, though Max had drunk far less than he'd pretended to.

Rain drummed against the narrow window, blurring the amber glow of streetlights in the old quarter below. The apartment smelled of damp plaster and the lavender soap Elena had brought on her second visit—small domestic touches that made the deception feel heavier in Max's chest.

She traced the rim of her glass with one finger, her eyes fixed on the dark red liquid. They'd been quiet for several minutes, the comfortable silence that comes after intimacy, but something had shifted in her posture. A tension in her shoulders that hadn't been there an hour ago.

"You've never asked me about Viktor's work," Elena said suddenly.

Max kept his expression neutral, though his pulse quickened. "I assumed you didn't want to talk about him."

"Most men in your position would be curious." She looked up, her green eyes sharp despite the wine. "What does he do? How much money does he have? Whether he suspects anything."

"I'm not most men."

"No." A small smile played at her lips, but it didn't reach her eyes. "You're not, are you?"

She stood, moving past him to the window. This close, Max could smell her perfume mixed with the scent of rain. She pressed her palm against the glass, watching water streak down the other side.

"I found encrypted files on his computer three months ago," she said quietly. "I wasn't snooping. He left it open, and I saw them when I brought him coffee in his study."

Max said nothing. Every instinct screamed at him to guide this conversation carefully, but he sensed that any attempt at manipulation now would shatter whatever fragile trust existed between them.

"He meets with people I don't recognize," Elena continued. "Russians, but not from our social circle. Men with hard faces who look at me like I'm furniture." She turned to face him. "And there's money. So much money that appears and disappears from accounts I'm not supposed to know about."

"Elena—"

"I'm not stupid, Max." Her voice was steady, but her hand trembled slightly as she raised her glass. "I know my husband is involved in something illegal. I've known for months."

The rain grew louder, filling the silence between them. Max watched her carefully, recalibrating everything. She was more than intelligent—she was observant, strategic, and far more aware than he'd given her credit for.

"Why are you telling me this?" he asked.

She laughed, a short, bitter sound. "I don't know. Maybe because you're the first person in years who's looked at me like I'm more than Viktor Volkov's wife. Or maybe..." She paused, studying his face with an intensity that made him feel exposed. "Maybe because I want to see how you react."

"How I react?"

"Whether you'll try to use this information. Whether you'll ask me questions." She stepped closer, her eyes searching his. "Whether you're exactly who you say you are."

Max's mind raced. This was the opening he needed, the perfect opportunity to begin the recruitment process. But the way she was looking at him—wary, testing, vulnerable—made his carefully rehearsed approaches feel like violations.

"I don't want to use you, Elena."

"Everyone uses everyone, Max. That's how the world works." She set down her glass with a soft click. "The question is whether you'll be honest about it."

Outside, a car horn blared in the narrow street. Someone shouted in French, the words lost in the rain. Elena's phone buzzed on the counter—Viktor's name flashing on the screen. She glanced at it but didn't move to answer.

"I should go," she said, but she didn't move toward her coat.

Max reached out, his hand hovering near her arm but not quite touching. "If you're in danger—"

"I'm always in danger." She met his eyes. "The question is what kind, and from whom."

The phone stopped buzzing. In the sudden quiet, Max could hear his own heartbeat, feel the weight of decisions pressing down on him. He thought of the surveillance equipment hidden in the bedroom, the reports he'd file, the handlers waiting for exactly this breakthrough.

"I can help you," he said carefully. "If you want out."

Elena's expression was unreadable. "Can you? Or would helping me just happen to serve some other purpose?"

She was testing him, and they both knew it. Every word from here mattered.

"Both things can be true," Max said finally.

For a long moment, Elena didn't respond. Then she picked up her wine glass and drained it, her eyes never leaving his face.

"Next time we meet," she said, "we should talk about what 'help' means to you. And what it might cost me."

She moved past him toward the bedroom where her clothes lay scattered on the floor. Max stayed in the kitchen, listening to the soft sounds of her dressing, the rustle of fabric and the zip of her dress.

When she emerged, perfectly composed again, she paused in the doorway.

"The files on Viktor's computer," she said. "They're updated every Tuesday evening. He works late those nights." She pulled on her coat. "I thought you should know."

Then she was gone, the door clicking shut behind her, leaving Max alone with the rain and the half-empty bottle of wine and the terrible certainty that everything had just become far more complicated.

**Scene 4: Elena breaks down and confesse...**

**Scene 4: Elena breaks down and confesses her fear of Viktor**

The rain had started again, drumming against the tall windows of the apartment in a rhythm that seemed to match the pulse in Max's throat. Elena sat curled into the corner of the leather couch, her legs tucked beneath her, wearing one of his shirts. The fabric swallowed her frame, making her look smaller, more fragile than he'd ever seen her.

She'd been quiet for the past twenty minutes, staring at the glass of wine in her hands without drinking. Max watched her from his position at the other end of the couch, noting the tension in her shoulders, the way her fingers trembled slightly against the stem.

"I can't do this anymore," she said finally, her voice barely audible above the rain.

Max's chest tightened. "Can't do what?"

"Any of it." She set the wine down on the side table with deliberate care, as if afraid it might shatter. "Pretending. Lying. Going home to him and..." She pressed her palms against her eyes. "God, I'm so tired of being afraid."

He moved closer, close enough to smell the jasmine of her perfume mixed with the scent of his own soap from her earlier shower. "Elena—"

"Do you know what he told me the last time I mentioned divorce?" Her hands dropped, and her eyes met his—dark, glistening, rimmed with red. "He said if I ever tried to leave, I would never see my family again. Not my mother. Not my sister. Not the niece I haven't held since she was born."

The words hung in the air between them like smoke.

"He has connections in Moscow. Friends in the FSB, in the prosecutor's office. He showed me photographs once, of my mother's apartment building, my sister's workplace. He didn't have to say anything else. I understood." Her voice cracked. "He owns me, Max. Completely."

A cold fury ignited in Max's gut, spreading through his chest like frost. He'd encountered men like Viktor before—men who wielded power like a weapon, who understood that the most effective chains were the ones made of love and fear. But knowing it intellectually was different from seeing the damage up close, from watching tears slide down Elena's cheeks.

"How long?" he asked quietly.

"Three years. Since we moved here." She laughed, a bitter sound. "I thought London would be freedom. A fresh start. Instead, it's just a prettier cage."

Max reached for her hand. Her fingers were ice-cold despite the warmth of the room. "You're not powerless."

"Aren't I?" She looked at him with something like desperation. "What can I do? Run? He'd find me. Go to the police? And tell them what—that my husband made threats? They'd send me back to him within hours. You don't understand what kind of man Viktor is. The people he knows. The things he's capable of."

"Then tell me." Max kept his voice steady, gentle, even as his mind raced through calculations and possibilities. "Help me understand."

Elena pulled her hand free and stood, pacing to the window. The rain-blurred city lights painted her profile in shades of amber and shadow. She wrapped her arms around herself, the shirt sleeves falling past her hands.

"I've seen things. Files on his computer—encrypted, but sometimes he leaves them open. Names. Numbers. Transfers to accounts in Cyprus, the Caymans. And the people who come to the house..." She shuddered. "Last month, there was a man. Russian, but trying to hide it. Viktor took him to his study, and when they came out, the man's knuckles were bleeding. Viktor just smiled and offered him brandy."

Max rose and moved behind her, careful not to touch her yet, giving her space. "What else?"

"Phone calls in the middle of the night. Trips he won't explain. Money appearing and disappearing." She turned to face him, and the fear in her eyes was raw, primal. "I'm not stupid, Max. I know he's involved in something illegal. Something dangerous. And I'm terrified that one day, whatever he's doing will come crashing down, and I'll be buried in the rubble."

"You won't be." The words came out harder than he intended, edged with a protectiveness that went beyond his cover, beyond the mission. He reached for her, and this time she came willingly, pressing her face against his chest.

Her shoulders shook with silent sobs. Max held her, one hand stroking her hair, the other pressed against her back. Through the thin cotton of his shirt, he could feel her heart racing.

This was the moment. The opening he'd been working toward. All he had to do was suggest an alternative, plant the seed that there might be a way out—for her, for her family. That he could help her, protect her, if she helped him first.

The words formed in his mind, practiced and precise. But as Elena's tears soaked through his shirt, as her fingers clutched at him like he was the only solid thing in a dissolving world, something in his chest twisted painfully.

"I won't let him hurt you," he heard himself say instead. "I promise."

She looked up at him, mascara smudged beneath her eyes, hope and disbelief warring in her expression. "How can you promise that? You don't know him. You don't know what he's capable of."

*But I do,* Max thought. *Better than you realize.*

"Trust me," he said, tilting her chin up with his fingers. "Please."

Elena searched his face for a long moment. Then she rose on her toes and kissed him—not with passion this time, but with something deeper. Gratitude. Desperation. Faith.

When she pulled back, she whispered, "I want to help. Whatever you need to know about Viktor, I'll tell you. I'll show you. Just... promise you'll get me out of this."

Max's blood ran cold even as he nodded. She knew. Somehow, she'd figured out that this wasn't just an affair, that he wanted information. And instead of running, she was offering herself as an asset.

It should have been a victory. Instead, it felt like the walls were closing in.

"We'll figure it out together," he said, the lie tasting like ashes on his tongue. "I promise."

Outside, the rain intensified, hammering against the windows like it was trying to break through.

**Scene 5: Max returns to his own apartme...**

**Scene 5: Max returns to his own apartment alone and reports to his handler**

The rain had started again by the time Max reached his apartment, a relentless percussion against the windows that matched the rhythm of his pulse. He stood in the dark for a long moment, jacket dripping onto the hardwood floor, letting his eyes adjust to the shadows. The place felt hollow after Elena's warmth—just another safe house dressed up with impersonal furniture and a refrigerator that hummed too loudly in the silence.

Her scent still clung to his clothes. Jasmine and something else, something uniquely her.

Max stripped off the wet jacket and tossed it over a chair, then moved to the kitchen. His hands were steady as he poured two fingers of whiskey into a glass, but he noticed the slight tremor when he raised it to his lips. The burn down his throat did nothing to settle the knot in his chest.

The encrypted phone sat on the counter like an accusation.

He had forty minutes before the scheduled check-in. Forty minutes to compartmentalize, to become the operative again instead of the man who'd held Elena in the darkness of that rented apartment while she'd confessed her fears. The man who'd kissed her temple and promised her she wasn't alone, knowing it was a lie wrapped in tradecraft.

*Encrypted files. Unknown contacts. Viktor threatening her family.*

It was everything the agency needed. Everything *he* needed to justify the last three months of careful manipulation. Elena had just handed him the keys to Viktor Orlov's inner circle, and all Max felt was the weight of what came next.

He drained the whiskey and poured another.

At precisely 11:47 PM, Max activated the phone. The screen glowed pale blue in the darkness. He entered the authentication code, waited through the connection protocols, and heard the familiar click of the secure line engaging.

"Nightingale." His handler's voice was crisp, businesslike. No names, never names. Just the operational designation Max had carried for six years.

"Checking in." Max kept his tone neutral, professional. He moved to the window, watching rain streak down the glass in silver rivulets.

"Status?"

"Progress. The asset has revealed knowledge of the target's activities." Max chose his words carefully, each one a small betrayal. "She's discovered encrypted files on his personal computer. She's also observed meetings with unidentified individuals."

A pause. Max could hear the faint scratch of pen on paper—his handler still took notes by hand during sensitive calls, a quirk from the Cold War days.

"Has she accessed the files?"

"No. They're encrypted. She doesn't have the technical knowledge."

"But she's curious." It wasn't a question.

"She's frightened." Max watched his reflection in the window, a ghost superimposed over the city lights. "The target has made threats. If she attempts to leave, he'll use his connections to ensure she never sees her family in Russia again."

"Leverage." His handler's voice carried a note of satisfaction that made Max's jaw tighten. "That's excellent. Fear and isolation—she's perfectly positioned for recruitment."

Max said nothing. Outside, a car passed below, headlights cutting through the rain.

"Nightingale? You copy?"

"I copy."

"Then you know what needs to happen next. Recruit her. Tonight's revelations indicate she's ready. She's already halfway there—she wants out, she wants protection. Give her both. Make her an asset."

Max closed his eyes. He could still feel Elena's fingers tracing patterns on his chest, her voice soft in the darkness: *I know something's wrong. I know Viktor is dangerous. But I don't know what to do.*

"It's too soon," Max heard himself say. "She's vulnerable, yes, but not committed. If we push now, we risk losing her entirely. She could panic, could tell Viktor—"

"She won't." His handler's certainty was absolute. "You've done your job well. She trusts you. She's emotionally invested. Use that."

The words landed like stones in Max's stomach. *Use that.* Use her trust. Use her fear. Use the intimacy they'd built, the confessions she'd whispered against his skin.

"I need more time," Max said, and hated the edge of desperation that crept into his voice. "Another week, maybe two. Let me solidify the relationship, make sure she's truly committed before we—"

"We don't have two weeks." His handler's tone sharpened. "Intelligence indicates Viktor is planning something significant. We need eyes inside his operation now, not when it's convenient for your timeline. Elena Orlova is our best chance at penetrating his network, and you've just confirmed she has access and motivation. What's the problem?"

Max's free hand curled into a fist against the window frame. Rain hammered against the glass.

"There's no problem."

"Then why the hesitation?" A pause, weighted with implication. "You're not getting emotionally compromised, are you, Nightingale?"

The question hung in the air like smoke. Max forced himself to breathe slowly, to keep his voice level.

"No."

"Good. Because you know what happens when an operative loses objectivity. You know how that ends." His handler let the threat settle. "Elena Orlova is not a person. She's an asset. A tool. The moment you forget that is the moment you become a liability."

Max stared at his reflection—the stranger in the glass with his face.

"I understand."

"Do you?" His handler's voice softened slightly, almost paternal. "Look, I know this part is never easy. You've spent months building rapport, creating intimacy. It feels real. But it's not. It's theater. You're playing a role, and so is she, whether she knows it or not. Don't confuse the performance with reality."

*She'd cried in his arms. Real tears, real fear.*

"When do you want the recruitment to happen?" Max asked.

"Next meeting. Lay the groundwork tonight if possible—a text, something to make her feel seen, protected. Then at your next encounter, make the pitch. Offer her a way out. Protection for her cooperation. We'll provide the details, the assurances. Your job is to sell it."

"Understood."

"One more thing." His handler's voice dropped. "If she refuses, if she shows any indication she might expose you or the operation, you know the protocols."

Max's blood went cold. The protocols. Sanitize the operation. Eliminate the risk.

"That won't be necessary."

"Let's hope not. But be prepared for all contingencies. Viktor Orlov doesn't tolerate betrayal, and neither do we." A pause. "Report again in forty-eight hours. And Nightingale? Don't let me down on this. We've invested too much to have it fall apart because of sentiment."

The line went dead.

Max stood in the darkness, phone still pressed to his ear, listening to the silence. Outside, the rain continued its assault on the city, washing everything clean and leaving it just as dirty as before.

He set the phone down carefully, precisely, as if it might shatter. Then he returned to the whiskey bottle and poured again, this time not bothering with the glass. The burn was sharper straight from the bottle, more honest.

His phone—his personal phone—buzzed on the counter. A text message.

*Thank you for tonight. For listening. For making me feel less alone. —E*

Max stared at the words until they blurred. His thumb hovered over the keyboard. The professional response was already forming: something warm, something that deepened her dependence, that positioned him as her only refuge.

*Use that.*

He typed: *You're not alone. I promise. Sleep well.*

Hit send.

Then he walked to the bathroom and braced his hands on the sink, staring at his reflection in the mirror. The man looking back had done this before—had recruited assets, had exploited vulnerabilities, had traded in human desperation for intelligence gains. That man had never hesitated.

But that man had never felt like this.

Max splashed cold water on his face, let it drip down his neck. When he looked up again, his expression had hardened into something familiar. The mask was back in place.

He had a job to do. Elena Orlova was an asset, a means to an end. In forty-eight hours, he would recruit her. He would offer her hope and protection, and in exchange, she would give him everything: access to Viktor's files, his contacts, his secrets. She would become a spy without even realizing the full extent of what she'd agreed to.

And if it went wrong, if she refused or panicked or threatened to expose him...

Max closed his eyes against that thought.

The

**Scene 6: Max and Elena meet again at th...**

**Scene 6: Max and Elena meet again at the apartment three days later**

The afternoon light filtered through the gauze curtains, casting pale shadows across the bedroom's worn wooden floor. Max lay on his back, one arm draped across his eyes, listening to the rhythm of Elena's breathing beside him. The sheets were tangled around their legs, still warm from their bodies.

Three days since their last meeting. Three days of Max rehearsing this moment, constructing the approach, calibrating the pitch. Now that it was here, the words felt like stones in his throat.

Elena shifted, her fingertips tracing idle patterns on his chest. Her touch was lighter than usual, distracted. Through the thin walls came the muffled sounds of the old quarter—a motorcycle accelerating, someone shouting in rapid-fire Portuguese, the distant clatter of dishes from a restaurant kitchen.

"You're quiet today," she said.

Max lowered his arm and turned to face her. Her dark hair spilled across the pillow, and her eyes—those remarkable gray eyes—studied him with an intensity that made his carefully constructed walls feel transparent.

"Just thinking," he said.

"About?"

He reached out, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. The gesture was automatic now, intimate in a way that had nothing to do with the mission. That was the problem.

"About what you told me," he said carefully. "About the files. The meetings."

Elena's hand stilled on his chest. "I shouldn't have said anything."

"I'm glad you did." Max sat up slowly, the sheet falling to his waist. He needed the physical distance to do this properly. "Elena, you said you feel powerless. That you can't leave."

"I can't." Her voice was flat, matter-of-fact. She remained on her back, staring at the ceiling. "You don't know Viktor. What he's capable of."

"Then maybe you need leverage of your own."

The words hung in the air between them. Max watched her profile, the way her jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. Outside, a church bell began to toll the hour—slow, resonant peals that seemed to count down to something inevitable.

Elena sat up abruptly, pulling the sheet around herself. She moved to the edge of the bed, her back to him, shoulders rigid beneath the thin cotton.

"Leverage," she repeated. The word sounded different in her accent, harder.

Max's training screamed at him to press forward, to exploit the opening. Instead, he found himself reaching for her shoulder, the touch gentle, almost apologetic.

"Information," he said quietly. "About what he's doing. Who he's meeting. It would protect you. Give you options."

She turned then, and the look in her eyes made his breath catch. Not anger—he could have handled anger. This was something else. Recognition. Understanding. The expression of someone who had just confirmed a suspicion.

"Was this your plan all along, Max?"

Her voice was steady, but he heard the tremor beneath it. Not fear. Something closer to disappointment, or perhaps resignation.

"Elena—"

"The way we met. Too convenient, yes?" She stood, wrapping the sheet more tightly around herself, and moved to the window. The afternoon light illuminated her profile, the elegant line of her neck, the slight furrow between her brows. "A handsome American. So interested in me. So easy to talk to."

Max rose from the bed, pulling on his pants. His mouth was dry. "It's not like that."

"No?" She glanced back at him, and her expression was unreadable. "Then tell me. What is it like?"

He crossed to her, stopping just short of touching distance. Close enough to see the pulse beating at her throat, the way her fingers gripped the windowsill.

"It started as a job," he said. The truth felt dangerous in his mouth, but lies felt worse. "But that's not what it is now."

"A job." She turned to face him fully. "And what is the job, exactly? What do you want from me?"

The question was direct, unflinching. Max had been trained for this—for recruitment pitches, for turning assets, for the delicate dance of manipulation and persuasion. But standing here, watching the way the light caught in her eyes, he found all his training insufficient.

"I work for people who want to know what Viktor is involved in," he said. "People who could help you, if you help them."

"Americans."

It wasn't a question, but he nodded anyway.

Elena was silent for a long moment, her gaze searching his face. The church bells had stopped, leaving only the ambient noise of the street below. Somewhere in the building, water ran through old pipes.

"And if I say no?" she asked finally. "If I walk out of here right now?"

Max's chest tightened. "Then you walk out. I won't stop you."

"But you'll find someone else. Another way to get to Viktor."

"Probably."

She laughed—a short, bitter sound. "At least you're honest about that."

She moved past him, gathering her clothes from where they lay scattered across the floor. Max watched her dress with practiced efficiency, each movement precise and controlled. He should say something, he knew. Make the pitch properly. Offer assurances, guarantees, whatever it took to secure her cooperation.

But the words wouldn't come.

Elena buttoned her blouse, then paused, her hands stilling on the fabric. When she looked up at him, her expression had shifted into something he couldn't quite read—calculation mixed with something softer, more vulnerable.

"These people you work for," she said. "They could really help me? Get me away from him?"

"Yes." Max stepped closer. "But it would be dangerous. If Viktor found out—"

"Everything is dangerous," she interrupted. "Staying is dangerous. Leaving is dangerous. At least this way..." She trailed off, looking down at her hands.

"At least this way, you have some control," Max finished.

She met his eyes again, and he saw the fear there, carefully masked but present. Also something else—determination, perhaps. Or desperation.

"I need to think," she said.

"Of course."

She collected her purse, checked her phone. The mundane gestures of someone preparing to return to their regular life, to the performance of normalcy. At the door, she paused with her hand on the knob.

"Max?"

"Yes?"

"If I do this..." She turned to face him one last time. "If I help you—I need to know it wasn't all lies. What we have here."

The question hung between them, demanding honesty he wasn't sure he could give. Because what did they have? An affair built on deception, sustained by mutual need and dangerous chemistry. And yet, standing here in the fading afternoon light, Max knew his feelings had become something he couldn't fully control or define.

"It's not all lies," he said quietly.

Elena held his gaze for three heartbeats, then nodded once, sharply. "I'll call you."

Then she was gone, the door clicking shut behind her, leaving Max alone in the apartment with the ghost of her perfume and the weight of what he'd just set in motion.

He moved to the window, watching until he saw her emerge onto the street below. She didn't look back, didn't hesitate, just walked away with her shoulders straight and her head high. Disappearing into the flow of pedestrians, returning to her gilded cage.

Max's phone buzzed. A text from Reeves: *Status?*

He stared at it for a long moment before typing back: *In progress.*

Outside, the city continued its afternoon rhythm, indifferent to the small betrayals and dangerous bargains being made in its hidden corners. Max poured himself a drink from the bottle he kept in the kitchen, then returned to the window.

He had done what he came to do. Planted the seed. Made the pitch. Now it was just a matter of waiting to see if Elena would choose survival over loyalty, freedom over fear.

The whiskey burned going down, but it didn't wash away the taste of guilt.

Or the memory of her eyes, asking if it had all been lies.
