## Chapter 3: Not Bobby Anymore

**Scene 1: Three months into the mission,...**

The observation room had become Sarah's tomb.

She sat in the same chair she'd occupied for seventy-three consecutive days, surrounded by a fortress of coffee cups in various stages of decomposition. The cleaning staff had learned to work around her, emptying trash bins and wiping surfaces while she remained motionless, eyes fixed on the wall of monitors displaying feeds from the lunar habitat.

The timestamp in the corner read 03:47 Houston time. Sarah had stopped noticing whether it was morning or night.

On the central screen, Bobby sat in his usual position at the habitat window. He'd been there for six hours and twelve minutes. Sarah knew because she'd been watching the entire time, her finger hovering over the playback controls, ready to catch any movement, any sign.

The Earth hung in the lunar sky beyond the reinforced glass, a blue-white marble suspended in eternal darkness. Bobby's helmet reflected its light, two tiny Earths captured in the curve of his visor. His hands rested on his knees, completely still. Only the slight rise and fall of his chest confirmed he was alive.

"Dr. Chen." A technician's voice, careful and quiet. Marcus had drawn the graveyard shift again. "You should eat something."

Sarah didn't respond. On the monitor, Bobby's right hand twitched—a small movement, but after hours of stillness, it might as well have been a gunshot. She leaned forward, close enough that her breath fogged the screen.

Bobby's hand rose slowly, as if moving through water. His fingers formed a shape she recognized immediately.

*Home.*

Then another sign, his hand moving outward, away from his body.

*Far.*

That was all. His hand dropped back to his knee. The silence stretched on.

Sarah's throat constricted. She pulled up the archive, her fingers moving across the keyboard with practiced efficiency despite the tremor in her hands. The system displayed Bobby's communication log for the past month:

Day 61: "Home far." (2 signs, 1 transmission)
Day 64: "Bobby small." (2 signs, 1 transmission)
Day 68: "Remember trees." (2 signs, 1 transmission)
Day 71: "Home far." (2 signs, 1 transmission)
Day 73: No communication.
Day 76: "Bobby small." (2 signs, 1 transmission)
Day 79: No communication.
Day 82: No communication.
Day 85: "Home far." (2 signs, 1 transmission)

In the first month, Bobby had transmitted an average of forty-seven signs per day—excited observations about the habitat, questions about Earth, requests for Sarah to tell him about forests and rivers and all the things he could see from his window but no longer touch.

Now, he averaged four signs per week.

Sarah scrolled further back, pulling up a video from Day 23. On screen, Bobby bounced around the habitat with the enthusiastic clumsiness of someone still learning lunar gravity. He signed rapidly, his hands a blur: *Sarah, Sarah, look! Bobby can jump so high! Everything floats! Bobby floats! Is this what birds feel?*

She'd laughed then. Actually laughed, relief and pride warming her chest as she watched him adapt, watched him explore, watched the vocabulary she'd taught him blossom into genuine curiosity and wonder.

The memory tasted like ash.

She closed the archive and returned to the live feed. Bobby hadn't moved. The Earth turned slowly in the window above him, clouds swirling across the Pacific, oblivious to the small figure watching from a quarter million miles away.

"The press conference is in four hours," Marcus said, closer now. He'd moved to stand beside her chair, his reflection visible in the dark portions of the monitor. "Director Okonkwo wanted to remind you—"

"I know."

"They'll want you to emphasize the mission success. The data collection, the habitat performance, the—"

"The propaganda." Sarah's voice came out flat, abraded by too many hours without sleep.

Marcus shifted uncomfortably. "The public engagement metrics."

On screen, Bobby's hand rose again. Sarah held her breath.

*Bobby small.*

His fingers formed the signs with mechanical precision, muscle memory divorced from meaning. Then his hand fell, and he returned to his vigil.

Sarah's vision blurred. She blinked hard, refusing the tears. She'd cried herself empty weeks ago.

"Dr. Chen, you can't keep doing this." Marcus's voice had gone soft with concern. "You haven't left this room in three days. You're not sleeping. You're barely eating. This isn't—"

"He's signing less." The words scraped out of her. "Every week, fewer signs. Simpler concepts. He's... regressing."

"He's a chimpanzee on the moon. Maybe he's just—"

"He's *lonely*." Sarah turned to look at Marcus for the first time, and she watched him flinch at whatever he saw in her face. "I taught him to understand what he lost. I gave him the words to know he's alone. Do you understand what that means?"

Marcus opened his mouth, closed it. On the monitor behind them, Bobby continued his silent watch.

"The rescue mission proposal," Sarah said, turning back to the screen. "Did Okonkow respond?"

The pause told her everything.

"The cost-benefit analysis came back negative," Marcus finally said. "The fuel requirements alone would consume three years of budget allocations. And the engineering challenges—"

"He's alive up there."

"I know."

"We put him there."

"I know."

"And now we're just going to watch him fade away because it's too expensive to bring him home."

Marcus didn't answer. There was no answer that wouldn't confirm what they both already knew.

Sarah pulled up another archived video, this one from Day 8. Bobby's first successful complex sentence: *Bobby see Earth. Sarah on Earth. Bobby miss Sarah.* The joy in his movements, the excitement of connection, of being understood.

She'd rewarded him with his favorite treat—mangoes, specially packaged for space. He'd signed *thank you* seventeen times.

The live feed showed Bobby's reflection in the habitat window, a dark shape against the darker lunar surface, crowned by the impossible blue of Earth. He hadn't moved in forty-three minutes.

Sarah's hand moved to the communication console. Her fingers hovered over the transmit button. She could sign to him, tell him she was watching, that she hadn't forgotten, that she was fighting to bring him home.

But what good were promises she couldn't keep?

She pulled her hand back.

"The press conference," Marcus said quietly. "They'll want you to smile. To talk about the triumph of the program. To—"

"I know what they want."

On the screen, Bobby's hand rose one more time. His fingers moved slowly, carefully forming a sign Sarah had taught him in their second week of training. A sign for something he'd seen in pictures but never experienced himself.

*Remember trees.*

Then stillness. Just Bobby and Earth and the infinite dark between them.

Sarah stared at the monitor until the image burned into her retinas, until she could close her eyes and still see him there, small and alone and waiting for a home that would never come.

The observation room's fluorescent lights hummed overhead, steady and indifferent. Somewhere in the building, people were arriving for the morning shift, ready to celebrate another successful day of the Lunar Habitat Initiative.

Sarah reached for another cup of cold coffee and settled deeper into her chair.

She would not look away.

**Scene 2: Sarah confronts NASA administr...**

**Scene 2: Sarah confronts NASA administrators and military officials in a heated meeting**

The conference room smelled of stale coffee and recycled air. Sarah had been in this room a thousand times—fluorescent lights humming overhead, the long mahogany table polished to a mirror shine, the American flag drooping in the corner beside NASA's blue meatball logo. But today the familiar space felt like a courtroom.

She stood at the head of the table, laptop open, Bobby's latest transmission frozen on the screen. His small form hunched in the habitat window, one hand pressed against the glass. The image had been there for forty-seven minutes before he'd moved.

"Home far," Sarah said, her voice tight. "That's what he signed yesterday. For six hours, that's all he said. Over and over. 'Home far.'"

Director Harrison sat with his fingers steepled, his expression carefully neutral. To his left, General Mackenzie checked his watch—the third time in ten minutes. Dr. James Reeves, the mission director, wouldn't meet her eyes.

"Dr. Chen," Harrison began, his tone measured, practiced. "We understand your concern—"

"Do you?" Sarah's hands slammed down on the table. The sound cracked through the room like a gunshot. "Because from where I'm standing, you don't seem to understand anything."

Mackenzie's jaw tightened. "Doctor, I'd suggest you watch your tone."

"Or what? You'll leave me on the moon too?" Sarah's laugh was bitter. She clicked to the next slide—a preliminary mission plan she'd worked on for three weeks straight, surviving on coffee and rage. "This is a viable rescue scenario. We have the Heavy Lift Vehicle in development. We accelerate the timeline, strip it down to essentials—"

"At a cost of four billion dollars," Harrison interrupted. "Minimum."

"So we spend it."

"The program doesn't have that kind of flexibility." Harrison's voice remained maddeningly calm. "Congress approved the lunar station budget with specific milestones and deliverables. Bobby was phase one. A successful phase one, I might add."

"Successful." Sarah tasted bile. "He's dying up there."

"He's surviving," Reeves said quietly. "The habitat systems are functioning within normal parameters. Food and water are adequate for another eight months—"

"He's not *surviving*, James. He's *deteriorating*." Sarah advanced the slides again, showing graphs she'd compiled from the medical telemetry. "His cortisol levels are through the roof. He's barely sleeping. His cognitive response times are slowing. These are signs of severe psychological trauma."

"In a human, perhaps." Mackenzie leaned back in his chair, arms crossed. "But we're talking about a chimpanzee, Dr. Chen. An animal."

The words hung in the air like a slap.

Sarah's vision blurred at the edges. "An animal you taught to communicate. An animal I taught to understand abstract concepts. Time. Distance. Loss." Her voice cracked. "He knows what's happening to him. That's not anthropomorphization—that's documented reality. He has the cognitive framework to comprehend his situation, and that comprehension is killing him."

"All the more reason," Harrison said, "to reconsider the scope of language instruction for future missions."

Sarah stared at him. "Future missions. You're already planning to do this again."

"The lunar station is a strategic priority," Mackenzie said. "Bobby proved the concept works. Biological test subjects can maintain long-duration presence at a fraction of the cost of human missions. The data we're gathering is invaluable."

"He's not a test subject anymore. He's a person."

"Legally, he's mission equipment." Mackenzie's voice was flat, final. "Expensive equipment that has fulfilled its primary function."

Sarah felt something break inside her chest. "You used him. You used what I taught him to sell this program to the public, and now that the cameras are off, you're just going to let him die up there alone."

"The public has moved on, Dr. Chen." Harrison spread his hands in a gesture of helplessness that Sarah knew was anything but. "The initial coverage was extraordinary—exactly what we needed to secure phase two funding. But that was four months ago. The news cycle doesn't sustain. People care about Bobby, certainly, but not four billion dollars worth."

"Then make them care again." Sarah heard the desperation in her own voice and hated it. "Another press conference. Show them the new transmissions. Let them see what's happening to him."

"And generate negative coverage?" Reeves shook his head. "Sarah, think about what you're asking. We show the public a deteriorating chimp on the moon, and Congress cuts the entire lunar program. Everything we've worked for, gone."

"Good! Maybe it should be gone if this is what it costs."

The room fell silent. Harrison exchanged a look with Mackenzie that Sarah couldn't read.

"Dr. Chen," Harrison said finally, "I think you need to take some time off. You're clearly emotionally compromised—"

"Don't." Sarah's voice was ice. "Don't you dare suggest I'm being hysterical. I'm the only one in this room who's being honest about what we've done."

"What we've *accomplished*," Mackenzie corrected. "A permanent lunar presence. A foothold for the next phase of space exploration. Strategic positioning against Chinese expansion. These are the realities of the program."

"And Bobby is the reality of the cost." Sarah closed her laptop with shaking hands. "I want it on record that I formally requested authorization for a rescue mission. I want it documented that I told you he's suffering, that he's aware of his suffering, and that we have the capability to bring him home."

"Noted," Harrison said. "Request denied."

The words were so simple. So final.

Sarah looked around the table at their faces—Harrison's bureaucratic blankness, Mackenzie's military stone, Reeves' guilty avoidance. These were people she'd worked with for years. People she'd shared breakthroughs and setbacks with. People she'd thought she knew.

"'Bobby love Sarah,'" she said softly. "That's what he signed this morning. Do you understand? He loves me. And I did this to him."

No one answered.

Sarah gathered her laptop and walked to the door. Her hand on the handle, she turned back.

"When this is over," she said, "when Bobby's gone and you're planning your next mission with the next animal, I want you to remember something. Every sign he makes, every thought he has up there alone—I gave him that. I gave him the words to understand what you've done to him. And I'll carry that for the rest of my life."

She left the door open behind her, unable to bear the sound of it closing.

In the hallway, the fluorescent lights buzzed and flickered. Sarah leaned against the wall, her breath coming in short gasps. Through the window, she could see the parking lot, the Texas sun beating down on asphalt, the normal world continuing as if nothing had changed.

Her phone buzzed. A notification from Mission Control.

New transmission from Luna-1.

Sarah's hands trembled as she opened it. On the screen, Bobby sat in his usual spot by the window. But this time, he was signing slowly, deliberately, to the camera.

"Remember trees."

Just that. Over and over.

"Remember trees."

Sarah slid down the wall until she was sitting on the floor, the phone clutched in both hands, watching Bobby remember a world he would never see again.

**Scene 3: Alone in her apartment, Sarah ...**

**Scene 3: Alone in her apartment, Sarah spirals into guilt-fueled insomnia**

The apartment had become a shrine to accusation.

Sarah sat cross-legged on the floor at 3:47 AM, her laptop balanced on a stack of unread journals, playing the same video for the fourteenth time. On the screen, a six-month-old Bobby tumbled across a padded playroom floor, his infant eyes bright with uncomplicated joy. His tiny hands reached for a red ball. She heard her own voice, younger, lighter: "Ball, Bobby. Can you sign 'ball'?"

Baby Bobby had just grabbed it with his feet instead, shrieking with delight.

She pressed replay. Watched him tumble again. Watched innocence that she had methodically dismantled, one sign at a time.

The coffee in her mug had gone cold hours ago, a thin film forming across its surface. Around her, photographs formed concentric circles—a mandala of guilt. Bobby at eight months, making his first deliberate sign. Bobby at two years, signing full sentences. Bobby at four, reading simple picture books, his brow furrowed in concentration that should never have existed behind those eyes.

*See made Bobby alone.*

Her hands trembled as she reached for another frame. This one she kept face-down, but she knew what it showed: Bobby at five, signing "Why?" for the first time. She'd celebrated. Written a paper. The question had seemed like a breakthrough.

Now she understood it had been a curse.

"I taught you to ask why," she whispered to the darkened room. "I never thought about whether you should."

Her phone buzzed. Another message from Director Hastings, the third today. She didn't read it. She knew what it would say—the same corporate sympathy, the same subtle pressure to move on, to think about the program's future. As if Bobby were a failed prototype rather than a person she'd raised from infancy.

A person she'd made capable of understanding his own abandonment.

Sarah pulled her laptop closer, fingers hovering over the keyboard. She opened the folder she'd been avoiding: raw footage from Bobby's first year on Earth, before the training protocols, before language. Hours of him playing, eating, exploring, grooming other chimps at the sanctuary. His face in those videos held a simple contentment she'd mistaken for limitation.

She'd called it enrichment when she started the signing sessions. Cognitive enhancement. Giving him tools to express himself, to communicate, to *think*.

To suffer with precision.

"Home not home anymore," she repeated his words, her voice cracking. "Bobby not Bobby anymore."

On her laptop, infant Bobby discovered his reflection in a mirror, patting it with wonder but no existential crisis. He didn't know yet that the creature in the glass was himself. Didn't know yet to ask *who* that self was, or *why* it existed, or whether it mattered.

She had taught him all of that.

Sarah's reflection stared back at her from the darkened window—hollow-eyed, unwashed, wearing the same clothes as yesterday. Or was it the day before? Time had become as fluid as her ethics, apparently. She looked away.

Her phone buzzed again. This time she grabbed it, hoping irrationally for a message from Mission Control, some sign that Bobby had returned to the camera. Instead: a news alert. *Public Interest in Lunar Chimp Wanes; NASA Shifts Focus to Mars Initiative.*

She hurled the phone across the room. It hit the wall with a crack that sounded like bone breaking.

In the silence that followed, she heard only her own breathing and the hum of her laptop. On screen, baby Bobby had fallen asleep in a hammock, one hand curled against his chest, his face peaceful in a way she would never see again.

Sarah pulled her knees to her chest, making herself small. Outside, Houston's pre-dawn traffic was beginning its distant rumble. Soon the sun would rise on another day she couldn't face. Soon her colleagues would send more concerned emails she wouldn't answer. Soon the world would forget Bobby entirely.

But she never would.

She had given him consciousness like a gift, wrapped in signs and symbols and the architecture of human thought. And consciousness had given him back the capacity for existential despair, for the understanding that he was alone in a way his biology had never prepared him for.

*Words made Bobby see.*

"I'm sorry," she whispered to the photographs, to the videos, to the static image of Earth still displayed on her secondary monitor—the view from Bobby's abandoned helmet camera. "I'm so sorry."

The words felt like nothing. Like signing to an empty room.

Her laptop chimed: an incoming message on the private channel she'd set up months ago, the one connected directly to Bobby's habitat systems. Her heart seized. She lunged for the keyboard, nearly knocking over the laptop in her desperation.

But it was just a system notification. Battery backup at 40% in Module C. Routine. Automated. Meaningless.

Sarah closed her eyes and felt the tears finally come, hot and useless, streaming down her face as the first gray light of dawn began to creep through her windows. Somewhere above, Bobby sat in his own dawn, watching Earth rise over the lunar horizon, understanding his isolation in ways she had made possible.

She had taught him to see.

And seeing had made him alone.

The cruelest gift of all.

**Scene 4: Bobby's final extended transmi...**

**Scene 4: Bobby's Final Extended Transmission**

The alert came at 3:47 AM Houston time.

Sarah was already in the observation room. She'd been there for six hours, watching the static feed of Bobby's habitat window, the curved edge of Earth visible in the corner of the frame. She hadn't been home in three days. Someone—Marcus, probably—had left a protein bar and coffee on the console beside her. Both had gone cold and untouched.

The sudden chime of an incoming transmission made her jolt upright, heart hammering against her ribs.

"Active signal from Habitat One," the automated system announced. "Video and telemetry receiving."

Sarah's hands trembled as she pulled up the feed. The screen flickered, then resolved into Bobby's face, closer to the camera than usual. Close enough that she could see the fine creases around his eyes, the silver threading through the fur at his temples. When had he gotten so much gray?

His hands moved into frame. Slow. Deliberate.

*Home not home anymore.*

Sarah's breath caught. The signs were perfect—her signs, the ones she'd taught him in those early sessions when everything had seemed like an adventure, like progress, like *triumph*. His fingers formed each word with careful precision, as if he were giving her a gift. Or a goodbye.

*Bobby not Bobby anymore.*

"No," Sarah whispered. Her hand reached toward the screen, fingers splaying against the cold glass. "No, baby, you're still—"

Behind her, the door opened. She heard footsteps, voices. Marcus. Dr. Reeves. Others. The room filling with bodies drawn by the alert, by the first extended transmission in seventeen days. She didn't turn around.

Bobby's hands continued.

*Sarah taught Bobby words.*

His eyes looked directly into the camera. Not past it, not through it. *Into* it. Into her.

*Words made Bobby see.*

The observation room had gone silent. Sarah could hear her own breathing, ragged and too fast. Could hear the hum of the monitors, the whisper of the ventilation system, the terrible vast distance between Houston and the Sea of Tranquility.

*See made Bobby alone.*

A sound escaped her throat—not quite a sob, not quite a word. Her vision blurred. She blinked hard, refusing to look away, refusing to miss a single moment of what Bobby was telling her.

*Bobby love Sarah.*

"I love you too," she said to the screen, voice breaking. "I love you too, I'm so sorry, I'm so—"

*Bobby forgive Sarah.*

The tears came then, hot and fast, streaming down her face. Behind her, someone—Marcus—put a hand on her shoulder. She shook it off, leaning closer to the monitor, close enough that her breath fogged the screen.

Bobby's hands stilled. He sat motionless for a long moment, just looking at the camera. Looking at her. His expression was calm. Almost peaceful. The face of someone who had made a decision.

Then he reached up and began unfastening his helmet camera.

"What's he doing?" Dr. Reeves asked sharply.

Sarah couldn't answer. Couldn't speak. Could only watch as Bobby's thick fingers worked the mounting clips with surprising gentleness. The image shook, tilted. She caught a glimpse of the habitat's curved ceiling, the equipment racks, the water recycler with its blinking green status light.

Bobby stood—the camera swinging in his hands, making her stomach lurch—and moved to the window. The large observation port that he'd spent so many hours sitting beside, staring at the blue-white marble of Earth hanging in the black.

He positioned the camera on the window ledge, adjusting it carefully. The frame steadied, centered on Earth. The planet filled the left side of the screen, brilliant and alive against the star-scattered darkness. Home. Unreachable.

For a moment, Bobby's hand appeared in frame, making one final sign.

*Goodbye.*

Then he stepped back. She saw him in profile, his orange suit bright against the habitat's white walls. He moved toward the airlock at the far end of the module, his gait slow and measured. Not hurried. Not panicked.

Purposeful.

"Someone stop him," Dr. Reeves said. "Send a command override, lock the—"

"There's nothing we can do," Marcus said quietly. "The delay is—"

"Bobby!" Sarah screamed at the screen. "Bobby, please, don't—"

But he was already out of frame. She saw the airlock indicator light change from green to amber. Heard the faint hiss of the pressurization cycle through the audio feed.

Then nothing.

Just Earth, hanging in the window. Beautiful and terrible and impossibly far away.

The observation room erupted in chaos—people shouting, fingers flying over keyboards, someone calling for the flight director. Sarah heard none of it. She stared at the screen, at the static image of home from a quarter million miles away, and understood with perfect, crystalline clarity what she had done.

She had given him language.

Language had given him consciousness.

Consciousness had given him the ability to understand his exile.

And understanding had given him this: the choice to end it.

"Dr. Chen." A hand on her arm, firmer this time. "Sarah, we need you to—"

"Get out," she said.

"Sarah—"

"*Get out!*" She whirled on them, on all of them—Marcus with his concerned eyes, Dr. Reeves with her clipboard, the technicians and analysts and administrators who had all celebrated Bobby's success, who had all posed for photos with the chimp who could talk, who could think, who could be *useful*.

They backed away, filing out in uncomfortable silence, leaving her alone with the feed.

Sarah sank into her chair and watched Earth hang in Bobby's window. Watched for movement that didn't come. Listened for transmissions that would never arrive.

The protein bar sat beside her, wrapped in silver foil. She picked it up with numb fingers, turned it over. The label cheerfully proclaimed it to be "Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Flavor."

Bobby had loved chocolate chip cookies.

She set it down and kept watching the screen, waiting for something she knew would never happen, as the Earth turned slowly in the lunar sky and the loneliest mile stretched on forever.

**Scene 5: Days pass with no communicatio...**

**Scene 5: Days pass with no communication from Bobby**

The observation room had become a tomb.

Sarah sat in the same chair she'd occupied for seventy-three hours straight, though she'd stopped counting after the first day. Someone had brought her coffee that morning—or was it yesterday morning?—and it sat untouched beside her, a skin of cream congealed across its cold surface. The cup bore a cheerful NASA logo, bright blue against white ceramic. Obscene in its optimism.

The wall screen still showed the feed from Bobby's helmet camera. Earth hung in the lunar sky, precisely where Bobby had positioned it. Clouds swirled over the Pacific in real-time, weather patterns shifting with glacial grace. Somewhere down there, storms were forming. People were being born. Trees were growing.

Bobby wasn't moving.

The habitat window reflected in the helmet's visor, a ghost image of curved glass and metal framework. Sometimes Sarah stared at that reflection, searching for movement, for any sign that Bobby had returned to the camera's field of view. The moon's terminator crept across the landscape with each passing hour, shadows lengthening and shortening in their eternal cycle, but nothing else changed.

The room's fluorescent lights hummed their monotonous song. Someone had turned off most of them—mercy or economics, Sarah didn't know—leaving only the emergency lighting and the glow from the screen. It cast her face in blues and whites, Earth-light filtering through 238,900 miles of vacuum to illuminate her vigil.

Her reflection in the darkened monitor beside the main screen startled her when she noticed it. Hollow eyes. Hair she hadn't brushed in days. She looked like someone who'd witnessed something terrible, which she supposed she had. The death of innocence. The birth of understanding. Perhaps they were the same thing.

"Dr. Chen."

She didn't turn. Director Morrison's voice came from the doorway, soft with a gentleness she'd never heard from him before.

"Sarah. You need to go home."

"He might come back." Her voice scraped out, raw from disuse and crying. "He might sign something. I need to be here."

Morrison's footsteps approached, careful and measured. He pulled up a chair beside her, the wheels squeaking against the floor. When she finally glanced at him, she saw he'd aged a decade in the past week. New lines bracketed his mouth. His eyes carried their own weight of guilt.

"The psych team thinks—" He stopped, started again. "They believe he's made his choice. That he's... found somewhere else to be. Away from the cameras. Away from us."

"You mean he's dead." The words came out flat, factual.

"We don't know that."

"His oxygen was getting low. The readouts before he moved the camera—"

"The habitat has reserves. He knows how to access them. You taught him."

Sarah laughed, a bitter sound that surprised them both. "Yes. I taught him. I taught him everything." She gestured at the screen, at Earth's patient rotation. "I taught him to see that. To know what it means. To understand that he's up there and everything he ever knew is down here, and he can see it but never touch it again."

"You gave him language. Communication. That's not—"

"I gave him exile." Sarah stood abruptly, her legs trembling from disuse. She steadied herself against the console, fingers finding the cool metal of the controls. "Do you know what the cruelest thing is, Director? Not that we sent him there. Not even that we're leaving him there. It's that I made him capable of knowing the difference."

Morrison said nothing. What could he say?

Sarah moved closer to the screen, close enough that Earth filled her vision the way it must fill Bobby's. She could see the terminator crossing Asia now, night swallowing cities and mountains and forests. Somewhere down there, chimpanzees were sleeping in trees, their minds blissfully small, their worlds perfectly complete within the canopy's embrace.

"Before words, he was just... present," she whispered. "He existed. He felt things—fear, curiosity, affection. But he didn't *know* he felt them. He didn't stand outside himself and observe his own loneliness." Her breath fogged the screen slightly. "I taught him to do that. I taught him to be aware of his own awareness. And that's what's killing him. Not the isolation. The *comprehension* of isolation."

"Sarah—"

"He forgave me." Her voice cracked. "In his last message. He said he forgave me. But I'm not sure forgiveness is even the right word for what needs to happen here. How do you forgive someone for giving you consciousness? For making you capable of your own suffering?"

Morrison stood, placed a hand on her shoulder. She could feel its weight, warm and human and utterly inadequate.

"The Board met this morning," he said quietly. "They're officially closing the observation detail. The feed will continue automatically, but they don't want personnel assigned to watch it anymore. They're calling it... they're saying the mission objectives have been completed."

Sarah closed her eyes. "Of course they are."

"I can give you another day. Maybe two. But then I need you to go home. See your family. Sleep in your own bed. Let someone else—"

"There is no one else." She opened her eyes, still fixed on Earth. "I'm the only one who knows what I did to him. I'm the only one who has to live with what that means."

Morrison's hand fell away. She heard him sigh, heard the chair scrape as he pushed it back.

"Twenty-four hours, Sarah. Then I'm having security escort you out. Doctor's orders."

His footsteps retreated. The door whispered shut.

Alone again, Sarah sank back into her chair. The coffee cup caught her eye, and she picked it up, sniffed it, set it down again. Her stomach was a knot of nothing. Food seemed like something from another life, when she was a different person who hadn't yet understood what it meant to be truly alone.

On the screen, Earth turned. Patient. Indifferent. Beautiful.

She thought about Bobby, wherever he was now. In the habitat's shadows, perhaps, away from windows and cameras and the constant reminder of home. Or maybe he'd walked out into the lunar plains, following some ancient primate instinct toward a horizon that would never bring him anywhere new. Or maybe—and this thought was somehow worse—maybe he was still there, just outside the camera's frame, staring at Earth with those dark, knowing eyes, trapped in the same vigil she was.

*See made Bobby alone.*

Sarah understood now. Really understood. Before language, before signs, before she'd opened that door in his mind, Bobby had been alone but not lonely. Isolated but not aware of his isolation. She'd given him the tools to bridge the distance, and in doing so, had made him capable of measuring it.

The loneliest mile wasn't the one between Earth and Moon. It was the one between understanding and peace. Between consciousness and contentment. Bobby had traveled it. And now, staring at his abandoned camera's view, Sarah realized she had too.

The screen's glow painted her face in shades of blue. Earth rotated. Time passed. And Sarah Chen sat in the darkness of Mission Control, learning what Bobby had learned: that sometimes the cruelest gift is the ability to comprehend your own isolation.

That perhaps loneliness isn't a distance at all.

Perhaps it's an awareness.

And once you have it, you can never go back to not knowing.

She would sit here for her remaining twenty-four hours. She would watch Earth turn. And she would carry Bobby's loneliness inside her own chest, where it would live alongside her guilt and her grief and her terrible, inescapable understanding.

It was the least she could do.

It was all she could do.

On the screen, a cloud formation over the Atlantic began to spiral into a storm system. Sarah watched it grow, and did not look away.

**Scene 6: In the final moments, Sarah si...**

**Scene 6: In the final moments, Sarah signs to the camera feed—knowing Bobby likely can't see it—then places her hand against the monitor showing Earth from the moon.**

The observation room had become Sarah's tomb.

Three days since Bobby's last message. Seventy-two hours of staring at the static feed—Earth hanging in lunar sky, perpetually half-shadowed, perpetually silent. The cleaning crew had stopped trying to coax her out. Someone left sandwiches by the door that she didn't touch. The coffee in her mug had grown a film.

Sarah sat cross-legged on the floor beneath the main monitor, neck craned back, bathed in the blue glow of home seen from 238,900 miles away. The image never changed. Bobby had positioned the camera with such care, centering Earth perfectly in frame. A deliberate composition. A final statement.

Or a gravestone.

Her hands moved before she realized what she was doing. Muscle memory. The vocabulary she'd so carefully constructed, now reflexive as breathing.

*Bobby,* she signed to the empty screen. Her fingers trembled. *Bobby, I'm here.*

The Earth stared back, indifferent.

*I'm sorry.* The signs were sharp, precise, even as tears blurred her vision. *I'm so sorry.*

She'd been signing to the feed for hours now. Days, maybe. Time had become as distant and irrelevant as the moon itself. She signed the same phrases over and over—apologies, explanations, justifications that sounded hollow even in silence. She signed his name. She signed her own.

She signed *alone* until her wrists ached.

Behind her, the door whispered open. Sarah didn't turn.

"Dr. Chen." Marcus's voice, gentle as a hand on a wound. "Sarah. You need to rest."

"He can't see me," she said, still signing as she spoke. "The camera's facing away. He can't see any of this."

"I know."

"But I can't stop."

Marcus moved into her peripheral vision, careful not to block her view of the screen. He looked worse than she'd ever seen him—eyes sunken, suit rumpled, the weight of administrative guilt carved into every line of his face.

"The board made their decision," he said quietly. "No rescue mission. The cost—"

"I know." Sarah's hands fell to her lap. "I was there."

"I voted against it. For what that's worth."

"It's worth nothing." The words came out flat, factual. "We both know that."

Silence settled between them, broken only by the ventilation system's eternal hum. On the monitor, Earth turned with geological patience, clouds swirling over oceans Bobby would never swim in again.

"He understood, at the end," Marcus said. "That message—Bobby forgive Sarah. That's... that's something."

Sarah laughed, a sound like breaking glass. "Is it? I gave him the tools to comprehend his own abandonment. I taught him to be conscious enough to forgive the unforgivable. What kind of gift is that?"

"The human kind."

She finally looked at him. Marcus met her gaze, and in his eyes she saw the same thing she felt gnawing at her chest—the understanding that they had created something beautiful and damned it in the same breath.

"We should never have taught him," Sarah whispered. "We should have left him innocent."

"Maybe." Marcus crouched beside her, joints popping. "Or maybe consciousness was always going to find him. Maybe that's what it does—it finds you, whether you want it or not. And then you have to live with what you see."

Sarah turned back to the screen. Earth, hanging in darkness. Home, impossibly far.

"He said 'Bobby not Bobby anymore,'" she murmured. "I understand that now. I'm not... I can't go back to who I was before this. Before him."

Marcus stood slowly, knees protesting. He rested a hand briefly on her shoulder—a gesture of solidarity, or surrender, or both.

"I'll make sure no one bothers you," he said. "Take as long as you need."

His footsteps retreated. The door sealed with a soft hiss, and Sarah was alone again.

Alone with Earth. Alone with the ghost of a chimpanzee 238,900 miles away, who had learned to name his isolation and in naming it, had become something more than animal and less than free.

Sarah stood on shaking legs. She approached the monitor until she was close enough to feel the static electricity prickling her skin. The Earth filled her vision—blues and whites and browns, the marble of existence, the cradle of everything that had ever mattered to anyone.

She raised her right hand and placed it flat against the screen.

The glass was warm. Her palm covered a hurricane system swirling over the Pacific. Beneath her fingers, home continued its rotation, indifferent to the touch.

"I see you," she whispered. Then, with her left hand, she signed it: *I see.*

And in that moment, Sarah understood what Bobby had understood. To see—truly see—was to recognize the distance between yourself and everything else. To name the world was to separate yourself from it. Language was the first exile, consciousness the first loneliness.

She had given Bobby words, and words had given him exile.

Now she stood in her own.

Her hand remained pressed against the screen, against the image of Earth as seen from the moon, and she felt the 238,900 miles between them collapse into nothing and stretch into infinity simultaneously. Bobby was up there, or had been. She was down here. Both of them staring at the same world from opposite sides of an unbridgeable distance.

Both of them alone.

Both of them conscious enough to know it.

"Bobby love Sarah," she said to the empty room, her voice barely a breath. "Sarah love Bobby."

The Earth turned. The monitor hummed. The distance remained.

And Sarah Chen stood in the observation room in Houston, Texas, her hand against the glass, understanding at last that isolation wasn't the price of consciousness—it was consciousness itself. The ability to see yourself as separate. To know you are known. To reach across the void and never quite touch.

This was what it meant to be aware.

This was what it meant to be human.

This was what she had given him.

Her hand slipped down the screen, leaving a smear of condensation from her palm. She stepped back. The Earth remained, centered perfectly in frame, exactly as Bobby had left it.

A monument to loneliness.

A testament to love.

Sarah turned toward the door, then stopped. She looked back one final time at the screen, at the blue marble hanging in darkness, and raised her hands.

*Goodnight, Bobby,* she signed to the empty feed. *I hope you found peace.*

*I hope you found home.*

The words hung in the air for a moment, then dissolved into the darkness as her hands fell still.

Sarah walked to the door. Behind her, the monitor continued its vigil—Earth from the moon, moon from the Earth, and in the space between them, the loneliest mile of all.

The mile between understanding and being understood.

The mile between reaching and touching.

The mile between consciousness and connection.

She didn't look back again.

The door sealed behind her with a whisper, and the observation room returned to its vigil—one monitor, one unchanging image, one story of exile and awareness and the terrible gift of being able to name your own isolation.

In the hallway, Sarah paused. Through the small window in the door, she could still see the glow of the screen. She pressed her hand against the glass one more time—not touching Earth now, but touching the room that held Earth's image, separated by another barrier, another distance.

Always another distance.

She closed her eyes and felt it—Bobby's loneliness, become her loneliness, become the loneliness at the heart of all consciousness. The price of seeing. The cost of knowing.

The burden of being awake.

When she opened her eyes again, her reflection stared back from the darkened glass—a ghost woman in a ghost hallway, reaching toward a ghost planet on a ghost screen.

All of them separated.

All of them seen.

All of them, finally, understood.

Sarah lowered her hand and walked away down the corridor, leaving the observation room to its eternal watch. Behind her, Earth continued to hang in lunar sky, witnessed by no one, turning in silence.

Alone, but not unseen.

Never again unseen.

That, at least, was something.

That, perhaps, was everything.
