### Summary

The story opens with dual timelines: flashbacks to the magical summer of 1981 when eighteen-year-old Robert and sixteen-year-old Silvia fall in love at a Texas drive-in theater, dancing under the stars and sharing dreams of forever. Their romance is cut short when Silvia's traditional family discovers the relationship and forbids her from seeing Robert, ultimately moving her across the state. The narrative then shifts to Día de los Muertos 2022, where widowed Silvia visits the cemetery to honor her late husband's memory with traditional ofrendas.

At the cemetery, Silvia encounters Frank, Robert's brother, who is visiting his own family graves. In a moment of unexpected vulnerability, Silvia confesses to Frank that she never stopped wondering about Robert over the years. Frank, moved by her honesty, promises to pass along her regards. The chapter ends with Frank visiting his recently widowed brother Robert, telling him about the encounter and watching as decades of buried emotions surface on his brother's face.
