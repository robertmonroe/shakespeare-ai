## Chapter 9: Exposed

**Scene 1: Viktor catches Elena in his st...**

**Scene 1: Viktor catches Elena in his study**

The drawer was still open when Elena heard the footsteps.

Her heart seized. The polished mahogany desk suddenly felt like a trap, the leather-bound ledgers and folders fanned before her like evidence at a crime scene. She'd been so focused on photographing the documents—the miniature camera still warm in her trembling palm—that she hadn't heard the study door open.

"Elena."

Viktor's voice cut through the room's heavy silence like a blade through silk.

She spun around, her hip catching the edge of the desk. The drawer rattled. In that fraction of a second, she saw his eyes—those pale blue eyes that had once looked at her with something resembling affection—track from her face to her hands to the open drawer behind her.

"Viktor." She forced her voice to remain steady, even as her pulse hammered against her throat. "I didn't hear you come in."

He stood in the doorway, still wearing his charcoal suit from dinner, his tie loosened but not removed. The hallway light behind him cast his face in shadow, making it impossible to read his expression. But she could feel his suspicion radiating across the Persian rug that separated them.

"What are you doing in here?" His accent thickened slightly—it always did when he was angry or aroused. Right now, she prayed it was neither.

Elena slipped the camera into her cardigan pocket with what she hoped looked like a casual gesture, then pressed her hand against her temple. "I have a terrible headache. I was looking for aspirin." She gestured vaguely toward the desk. "I thought you might have some in your drawer."

Viktor didn't move. Didn't blink. The grandfather clock in the corner ticked five times before he took a step into the room.

"Aspirin." He repeated the word as if tasting it, testing it for poison.

"Yes." Elena moved away from the desk, putting distance between herself and the incriminating evidence. Her legs felt liquid, unreliable. "I checked the bathroom cabinets first, but—"

"The medicine is in the kitchen." Viktor's voice was soft now, dangerously soft. He took another step forward. "You know this. You organized the cabinets yourself last month."

The study suddenly felt smaller. The walls—lined with books Viktor had never read, art he'd purchased for status rather than beauty—seemed to press inward. The scent of his cologne and old leather and something else, something metallic like fear, filled her nostrils.

"I forgot." She tried to laugh, but it came out wrong, strangled. "I wasn't thinking clearly. The headache—"

"Close the drawer, Elena."

It wasn't a request.

She turned, her hands shaking now in a way she couldn't control, and pushed the drawer shut. The soft click of wood against wood sounded like a gunshot in the quiet room.

When she faced him again, Viktor had moved closer. Close enough that she could see the muscle working in his jaw. Close enough to see that his eyes had gone cold and flat, the way they looked in photographs from his military service, from before he'd learned to play the respectable businessman.

"Your hands are shaking." He observed this clinically, without warmth. "Are you nervous, my dear?"

"The headache—"

"Show me your pockets."

The world tilted. Elena's mouth went dry.

"Viktor, this is ridiculous. I was just—"

"Show. Me. Your. Pockets." Each word dropped like a stone into still water.

The camera in her cardigan pocket felt like it weighed a thousand pounds. Her phone—with its panic signal, with Max on the other end—was in her other pocket. She had seconds to decide. Seconds to choose between maintaining the lie and triggering the alarm that would bring everything crashing down ahead of schedule.

Viktor's hand shot out and gripped her arm, his fingers digging into the soft flesh above her elbow. The sudden violence of it made her gasp.

"I asked you a question." His face was inches from hers now, and she could smell the brandy on his breath, see the tiny broken capillaries in the whites of his eyes. "What were you really looking for in my desk?"

The clock ticked. Her heart hammered. And in Viktor's eyes, she saw the exact moment when suspicion crystallized into certainty.

He knew.

**Scene 2: Viktor grabs Elena's arm viole...**

**Scene 2: Viktor grabs Elena's arm violently**

The words died on Elena's lips as Viktor's hand shot out, his fingers clamping around her wrist like a vise. The force of his grip sent a jolt of pain up her arm, and she gasped, her carefully constructed excuse evaporating in the sudden violence of his movement.

"Don't lie to me," he hissed, yanking her toward him. The scent of whiskey on his breath mingled with his cologne—a smell that had once been comforting, now turned acrid with menace. "You think I'm stupid? You think I don't know when my own wife is lying?"

Elena's heart hammered against her ribs. The study seemed to contract around them, the mahogany walls pressing in, the leather-bound books bearing witness to her unraveling. "Viktor, you're hurting me—"

"Aspirin." His laugh was sharp, brittle. "In my locked desk. At two in the morning." His free hand moved to her jacket pocket, and Elena felt her blood turn to ice.

"No—wait—" She tried to pull away, but his grip only tightened. Her bones ground together beneath his fingers.

Viktor's hand plunged into her pocket. Time seemed to slow as his fingers closed around the miniature camera—no larger than a button, but damning as a loaded gun. He pulled it out, holding it up to the lamplight. For a moment, he simply stared at it, his face unreadable.

Then understanding dawned, and with it, fury.

"You—" The word came out strangled. His face flushed crimson, the veins in his neck standing out like cables. "You've been spying on me? In my own house? My own *wife*?"

"Viktor, please, let me explain—"

The slap came without warning. His palm connected with her cheek, the crack echoing off the walls like a gunshot. White-hot pain exploded across her face, and she stumbled backward, catching herself against the desk. The metallic taste of blood filled her mouth.

"How long?" Viktor's voice had dropped to something worse than shouting—a cold, deadly calm. He advanced on her, still clutching the camera. "How long have you been betraying me?"

Elena's hand moved instinctively toward her other pocket, where her phone waited. The panic signal. She just needed to reach it. Her fingers trembled as they slipped inside.

"Answer me!" Viktor grabbed her by the shoulders, shaking her hard enough to rattle her teeth. The lamp on his desk flickered, casting wild shadows across his contorted features. This wasn't the man she'd married, the one who'd courted her with poetry and promises. This was someone else entirely—someone capable of anything.

"I—" Elena's thumb found the phone's edge, sliding along its surface, searching for the button. "I didn't have a choice—"

"There's always a choice." His grip shifted to her throat, not quite squeezing, but the threat implicit in the placement of his fingers. "Who are you working for? CIA? FBI?"

The pressure on her windpipe made speech difficult. Black spots danced at the edges of her vision. Her thumb finally found the panic button—three quick presses. Click-click-click. Silent. Invisible. A lifeline cast into the darkness.

Please let Max be monitoring. Please let him see it.

Viktor's eyes narrowed. "What did you just do?" He shoved her backward, and she crashed into the bookshelf behind her. Leather spines dug into her spine. A heavy volume tumbled to the floor with a thud.

"Nothing—I didn't—"

He was on her again, his hand diving into her other pocket, extracting the phone. His eyes scanned the screen, and Elena saw the exact moment he understood. The panic signal had gone through. A small icon pulsed in the corner—a beacon she couldn't hide.

"No." Viktor's voice dropped to a whisper. "No, no, no."

He hurled the phone against the wall. It shattered, pieces scattering across the Persian rug like shrapnel. Then he turned back to Elena, and what she saw in his eyes made her stomach drop.

"You've destroyed everything," he said softly. "Do you understand that? Everything we built. Everything I worked for."

He moved toward the desk, toward the locked drawer where she knew he kept his gun. Elena's mind raced, calculating distances, escape routes. The door was ten feet away. The window behind her, double-paned and alarmed. Viktor stood between her and freedom.

"Viktor, wait—" She held up her hands, palms out. "They made me do it. They have evidence—fabricated evidence—they said they'd destroy me if I didn't cooperate."

He paused, his hand hovering over the drawer. "Evidence of what?"

"Financial crimes. They doctored documents, made it look like I was embezzling from my own foundation." The lie came smoothly, desperately. She'd prepared for this possibility, though she'd prayed it would never come. "They said they'd send me to prison unless I helped them."

Viktor's jaw worked. She could see him thinking, weighing, calculating. For a man like him, betrayal wasn't just personal—it was strategic. And strategy could be manipulated.

"I can fix this," Elena pressed, tasting blood on her split lip. "I can be more useful to you working with them. I can feed them false information. Viktor, please—we can turn this around."

His hand remained on the drawer pull. Outside, a car passed on the street, its headlights briefly illuminating the room before plunging it back into shadow. The grandfather clock in the hall chimed once. Two-thirty.

How long until Max arrived? Fifteen minutes? Twenty? An eternity in this moment.

Viktor's fingers tightened on the drawer pull, and Elena braced herself for what came next.

**Scene 3: As Viktor makes urgent phone c...**

**Scene 3: As Viktor makes urgent phone calls**

Viktor's voice cut through the study like shattered glass—sharp, rapid bursts of Russian that Elena couldn't fully follow but understood in her bones. He'd moved to the far corner of the room, phone pressed to his ear, his free hand gesturing violently as he spoke. The miniature camera sat on his desk between them like an accusation, its tiny lens catching the lamplight.

Elena's cheek throbbed where he'd struck her. She could taste copper on her tongue. Her phone was still in her jacket pocket, and while Viktor's attention was diverted by his call, she slipped her hand inside, fingers trembling as they found the device. The panic signal was a specific sequence—volume up, volume down, power button three times in rapid succession. She'd practiced it a hundred times in training, never imagining the sick terror that would accompany actually using it.

*Click. Click. Click.*

Done. Max would know. Fifteen minutes, maybe twenty if traffic was bad. She needed to survive that long.

Viktor ended his call with a curt phrase and turned back to her, his eyes cold and calculating. The rage had crystallized into something worse—controlled fury, the kind that made decisions.

"Viktor, please—" Elena started, but he raised a hand.

"Do not speak unless I tell you to speak." He picked up the camera, turning it over in his palm. "Who are you working for? CIA? FBI?"

This was it. The lie had to be perfect.

Elena let her shoulders sag, let tears—real ones, born of genuine fear—spill down her cheeks. "I didn't have a choice," she whispered. "They have... they fabricated evidence against me. Financial crimes, connections to Russian oligarchs. They said they'd destroy everything—my career, my reputation, my life—unless I cooperated."

Viktor's expression didn't change, but she saw something flicker in his eyes. Interest, perhaps. Or calculation.

"They approached me six months ago," she continued, the words tumbling out in a rush that sounded authentic because her terror was authentic. "After I started seeing you. They said they knew about us, that they could use it. I told them no at first, but they showed me the documents they'd created. Bank transfers that never happened. Emails I never sent. It looked... God, Viktor, it looked real."

"Which agency?" His voice was ice.

"FBI counterintelligence. A man named Harper, though I don't think that's his real name." She was pulling details from old case files, mixing truth with fiction. "They wanted information about your business dealings, your contacts in Moscow. I gave them nothing important—just surface details they could have found themselves."

Viktor moved closer, and Elena fought the urge to recoil. The study suddenly felt suffocatingly small, the mahogany walls closing in. The smell of his cologne—something expensive and woody—mixed with the leather scent of the furniture and her own fear-sweat.

"And the camera?"

"They insisted. Said they needed proof I was trying, or they'd activate the evidence." Elena met his eyes, forcing herself to hold his gaze. "But Viktor, listen to me. This could work in your favor."

His eyebrow raised fractionally. "Explain."

"I can feed them false information. Become a double agent." The words felt surreal coming from her mouth, a spy novel plot she was improvising in real time. "You control what they learn. We can use their operation against them. I'll tell them you suspect nothing, that I'm gaining your trust. Meanwhile, you feed me exactly what you want them to hear."

Viktor was silent for a long moment, studying her face with the intensity of a man who'd spent a lifetime reading people, detecting lies, calculating angles. The grandfather clock in the corner ticked steadily, each second an eternity.

Outside, a car passed on the street. Normal life, continuing obliviously.

"You expect me to believe," Viktor said slowly, "that you would betray your own government?"

"They betrayed me first." Elena injected bitterness into her voice, thinking of every case that had gone wrong, every bureaucratic failure, every time the system had let her down. It wasn't hard to sound convincing. "I'm a lawyer, Viktor. I understand leverage. Right now, I have none with them. But with you... if we work together, we both win. You neutralize their operation, and I get my life back."

Viktor's phone buzzed. He glanced at it, then back at her, his jaw tight. Another call in Russian, this one shorter, more clipped. When he hung up, his expression had hardened again.

"My people are coming," he said. "They will want to ask you questions. Different kinds of questions."

Elena's blood turned to ice water. She thought of the panic signal, of Max racing through D.C. traffic. How many minutes had passed? Five? Seven?

"That's a mistake," she said, keeping her voice steady through sheer force of will. "If I disappear, Harper will know something went wrong. The FBI will be all over you within hours. But if I go back, if I play along..." She let the implication hang.

Viktor picked up his phone again, but didn't dial. His thumb hovered over the screen.

The study's silence pressed against Elena's eardrums. She could hear her own heartbeat, feel the pulse in her bruised cheek. The miniature camera sat between them like a ticking bomb.

"Tell me something," Viktor said finally. "Something they don't know. Prove you're willing to cross that line."

Elena's mind raced. She needed to give him something, but not too much. Something that sounded significant but wouldn't compromise actual operations.

Before she could answer, she heard it—faint but distinct. The sound of a car door closing outside, too quiet, too controlled. Not Viktor's people.

Max.

She had seconds to decide: keep playing the double agent angle, or prepare for the chaos about to erupt.

Viktor heard it too. His eyes narrowed, and his hand moved toward the desk drawer where she knew he kept a gun.

**Scene 4: Max receives Elena's panic sig...**

**Scene 4: Max receives Elena's panic signal while fifteen minutes away**

The vibration against Max's ribs felt like a defibrillator shock.

He was reaching for his coffee when the phone buzzed—three short pulses, pause, three more. The panic signal. Elena's panic signal.

The paper cup hit the dashboard, brown liquid exploding across the console. Max didn't notice. His hand was already moving, yanking the phone from his jacket, thumbs flying across the encrypted app even as his other hand slammed the gear shift into drive.

The tracker showed a stationary red dot. Still at the Volkov residence.

"Fuck." The word came out quiet, deadly calm.

He punched the accelerator, the sedan lurching forward into traffic. Horns blared. Max cut across two lanes, his mind already three steps ahead, calculating routes, response times, contingencies.

Fifteen minutes. He was fifteen goddamn minutes away.

His earpiece crackled to life. "Carter."

"Signal received," Max said, his voice flat, professional, betraying nothing of the ice water flooding his veins. "Operation compromised. I need immediate extraction at the Volkov residence. How fast can you mobilize?"

"Rodriguez and I are eight minutes out from the safe house. We can be armed and rolling in ten."

"Make it eight. Meet me two blocks south of the target. Come heavy."

"Copy that."

The line went silent, but Max kept the channel open. His eyes flicked between the road and the tracker on his phone, mounted now on the dashboard. The red dot hadn't moved. Elena was still inside.

*Still alive*, he told himself. *She's still transmitting.*

He took a corner too fast, tires screaming against asphalt. A taxi swerved, driver shouting something Max didn't hear. The city blurred past—streetlights, storefronts, pedestrians jerking back from the curb. Everything reduced to obstacles between him and that red dot.

His hands were steady on the wheel, but his jaw ached from clenching. He forced himself to breathe, to think tactically. Viktor Volkov wasn't some street thug. Former SVR, connected, paranoid. If he'd caught Elena with evidence, he wouldn't hesitate.

The image of her face flashed through Max's mind—that slight tremor in her smile when she'd left for the dinner party, the way she'd touched his arm and said, "See you soon."

He'd let her walk in there. He'd sent her in there.

"Monroe." Rodriguez's voice cut through his thoughts. "We're loading now. What's the play?"

Max's eyes tracked the GPS, recalculating. Thirteen minutes now. Still too long.

"Silent approach, two-block perimeter. I'll provide real-time intel from the tracker. We breach on my signal—front and rear simultaneously. Volkov is SVR-trained, assume he's armed. Priority one is getting Elena out alive."

"Rules of engagement?"

Max's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. "Whatever it takes."

"Copy."

The sedan rocketed through a yellow light, the intersection a blur of color and motion. Max's training kept his breathing even, his movements precise, but underneath the professional veneer, something darker churned. He'd run dozens of extractions, pulled assets from hostile situations across three continents. This was just another op.

Except it wasn't.

His phone screen glowed in the darkness of the car. The red dot pulsed like a heartbeat. *Elena's* heartbeat.

"Carter, what's your ETA?"

"Six minutes to rendezvous point."

Six minutes for them. Eleven for him. An eternity.

Max cut through a narrow side street, barely wide enough for the sedan. Brick walls flew past on either side, close enough to scrape paint. He emerged onto a main thoroughfare, accelerating hard.

The tracker app showed no movement. Elena hadn't tried to run. Either she couldn't, or she was playing it smart, keeping Viktor talking. Buying time.

*Hold on*, he thought. *Just hold on.*

His earpiece crackled. "Monroe, Rodriguez. We're armed and mobile. En route to rendezvous."

"Confirmed. Radio silence from here until breach. Maintain encrypted channel only."

"Copy."

Max's mind raced through the layout of the Volkov residence. He'd memorized the floor plans weeks ago—exits, sight lines, potential choke points. Viktor's study was on the second floor, northeast corner. Two staircases, one front, one rear. Windows overlooking the garden.

Options. He needed options.

The sedan's engine roared as he pushed it harder, weaving through traffic with surgical precision. Nine minutes now. Every second mattered. Every second Elena was in there with Viktor, the situation could deteriorate.

He'd seen what happened to compromised assets. The interrogations. The reprisals.

His jaw clenched tighter.

Red light ahead. Max didn't slow. He checked the mirrors, calculated the crossing traffic, and shot through the intersection. More horns. More angry shouts dissolving into the night behind him.

The tracker showed the red dot still stationary.

*Still there. Still transmitting.*

But for how long?

Max's fingers drummed once against the steering wheel—the only outward sign of the controlled fury building in his chest. Then his hands steadied, his face hardening into the mask he wore in the field. Emotion was a liability. Emotion got people killed.

He'd save Elena first. Feel later.

The city lights streaked past, and Max drove faster into the darkness, counting down the minutes, the seconds, until he could bring her home.

Or burn down everything trying.

**Scene 5: Viktor wavers between killing ...**

**Scene 5: Viktor wavers between killing Elena immediately and exploiting her offer**

The silence stretched like a wire pulled taut, ready to snap.

Viktor stood motionless, the miniature camera still pinched between his thumb and forefinger. His other hand gripped his phone, the screen dark now, the rapid-fire Russian conversation concluded. Elena couldn't breathe. Couldn't think beyond the metallic taste of blood in her mouth and the throbbing pain radiating from her split lip.

The study felt smaller now, the walls pressing in. The antique clock on the bookshelf ticked with obscene loudness—each second a countdown she couldn't afford. How long since she'd triggered the panic signal? Three minutes? Four? Max was fifteen minutes away. She had to survive eleven more.

Maybe twelve.

Viktor's jaw worked, muscles flexing beneath his skin. His eyes—those gray eyes she'd once found distinguished, even handsome—were flat and cold as January ice.

"Blackmail," he said finally, the word dropping into the silence like a stone into still water. "You expect me to believe American intelligence is blackmailing *you*? My wife?"

Elena forced herself to meet his gaze, even as her hands trembled. She pressed one palm against the edge of his desk to steady herself, feeling the polished mahogany slick beneath her sweating fingers.

"They fabricated documents." Her voice cracked, and she let it—let the fear show because it was real, and maybe that would make the lie more convincing. "Financial records. They made it look like I'd been embezzling from the foundation. Said they'd destroy me, destroy my reputation, unless I—"

"Unless you spied on me." Viktor's laugh was sharp, humorless. He set the camera down on the desk with exaggerated care, as if it were a chess piece he was considering. "How convenient. How perfectly constructed."

He moved closer, and Elena's spine pressed against the desk. The lamp cast his shadow long across the Persian rug, swallowing her in darkness.

"Viktor, please—"

"Do you know what they do to traitors in Moscow?" His voice was conversational now, almost gentle. That terrified her more than the rage. "My contacts will be here in twenty minutes. Maybe less. They'll have questions. Many, many questions."

Twenty minutes. The Russians would arrive before Max.

Elena's mind raced, cataloging possibilities, discarding them just as quickly. The letter opener on the desk—too far. The heavy crystal paperweight—she'd never reach it in time. The door—locked from the inside, and Viktor stood between her and it.

"I can be useful to you," she said, the words tumbling out. "Think about it. They trust me now. I can feed them whatever you want. Disinformation. False leads. I can—"

"You can die." Viktor's hand shot out, fingers closing around her throat. Not squeezing—not yet—but the threat was clear in the pressure of his thumb against her windpipe. "That would be simpler. Cleaner."

Her pulse hammered against his palm. She could feel it, wild and desperate, a trapped bird beating its wings. The study tilted, and she gripped the desk harder, knuckles white.

"But perhaps..." Viktor's eyes narrowed, calculation flickering behind the rage. "Perhaps you're right. A double agent could be valuable. If you're truly compromised, if they truly believe they own you..."

Hope flared, sharp and painful. Elena nodded as much as his grip allowed. "Yes. Exactly. I can—"

"Show me your phone."

The hope guttered out.

"My phone?"

"Now, Elena." His fingers tightened fractionally. "Unless you'd prefer I search you myself."

Her phone was in her jacket pocket, the panic signal already sent. If he looked at it, he'd see the alert, see the emergency message to Max. Game over.

The clock ticked. Eight minutes, maybe. Seven.

"I left it in the bedroom," she lied, and watched his expression darken.

Viktor's free hand moved to her jacket, patting the pockets. She felt the moment his fingers found the phone's rectangular outline. Felt the shift in his breathing, the subtle tension in his shoulders.

"You left it in the bedroom," he repeated softly.

He pulled the phone free, and Elena's heart stopped. His thumb moved toward the screen, toward the fingerprint sensor that would unlock it and reveal everything.

Then—a sound. Distant but distinct. The low rumble of an engine on the street outside, moving fast.

Viktor's head snapped toward the window, his grip on her throat loosening just slightly. Elena sucked in air, her vision clearing enough to see his expression shift from calculation to suspicion to something harder.

Understanding.

"How long ago?" he asked, his voice deadly quiet.

"I don't—"

"How long ago did you signal them?" He released her throat and grabbed her wrist instead, twisting until she gasped. "How long, Elena?"

The engine sound grew louder. Closer.

Viktor's phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, and his face went white with fury. "They're not coming," he said, and Elena realized he meant his Russian contacts. "The Americans are jamming communications in the area. How long have they been—"

Glass shattered somewhere downstairs.

Viktor's hand went to his waistband, pulling out a pistol Elena had never known he carried. The sight of it—black, compact, utterly real—made her legs go weak.

"Get down," he snarled, shoving her toward the floor behind the desk. "Now."

Footsteps pounded up the stairs. Multiple sets. Fast and tactical.

Viktor moved to the door, weapon raised, and Elena pressed herself against the desk's solid bulk, her ears ringing, her breath coming in short, sharp gasps.

The doorknob rattled.

Then the shooting started.

**Scene 6: Max and his extraction team br...**

**Scene 6: Max and his extraction team breach the Volkov residence**

The front door exploded inward with a concussive blast that sent splinters of mahogany spinning through the foyer. Max was through the smoke before the echo faded, his Glock 19 raised, eyes scanning the marble-floored entrance hall with predatory focus.

"Go, go, go!"

Carter swept left, Rodriguez right, their suppressed weapons coughing as Viktor's security personnel emerged from the east wing. The first guard went down with two rounds to the chest, the second diving behind a marble column as bullets chipped stone and sent white dust cascading through the air.

Max didn't slow. He'd studied the floor plans during the drive over, his hands white-knuckled on the steering wheel while his team loaded magazines and checked body armor. The study was northwest, second floor. Elena's panic signal had gone silent three minutes ago—three minutes that felt like hours compressed into razor-sharp seconds.

"Study, northwest!" he barked into his throat mic, taking the curved staircase two steps at a time.

Behind him, Carter's weapon barked again, followed by the wet thud of a body hitting marble. "First floor clear!"

The second-floor hallway stretched before Max like a tunnel, Persian runners muffling his footfalls. Portraits of stern-faced Volkov ancestors watched him pass, their painted eyes judging. He didn't care. The only thing that mattered was the closed door at the end of the hall, ornate and heavy, and what might be happening behind it.

A guard rounded the corner ahead, raising an AK-47. Max fired twice, center mass, then once more as the man fell. No hesitation. No mercy. Not tonight.

He reached the study door and heard voices inside—Viktor's cultured baritone, tight with fury, and Elena's voice, higher, strained. She was alive. The relief that flooded through him was immediately crushed beneath tactical necessity.

Rodriguez appeared at his shoulder, breathing hard. "Breach?"

Max shook his head, hand on the doorknob. Surprise over force. He turned it slowly, finding it unlocked, then kicked it open and went in low.

The scene burned into his retinas: Viktor behind his desk, phone in one hand, pistol in the other. Elena on the floor near the leather chair, blood trickling from her split lip, her eyes wide with terror and something else—determination. The miniature camera lay smashed on the desk between them.

Viktor's gun swung toward Max.

Max fired first. The round caught Viktor in the shoulder, spinning him backward. The phone clattered across the desk as Viktor's pistol discharged into the ceiling, plaster raining down like snow.

"Elena, down!" Max advanced into the room, Rodriguez covering the door behind him.

But Elena was already moving, scrambling away from Viktor as he clutched his shoulder, red seeping between his fingers. His face was a mask of rage and calculation, even in pain.

"You're making a mistake," Viktor hissed, his accent thicker now. "Do you know who I am? Who I work with?"

"Yeah," Max said, keeping the Glock trained on Viktor's chest. "I know exactly who you are."

Gunfire erupted from the hallway—Carter's voice crackling over the radio: "More hostiles, coming up the east stairs!"

Viktor smiled through his pain, a predator's expression. "You won't leave here alive."

Max moved to Elena, never taking his eyes off Viktor. She was shaking, her dress torn at the shoulder, a bruise already darkening her cheekbone. When he touched her arm, she flinched, then grabbed his hand so tightly her nails dug into his skin.

"I'm okay," she whispered, but her voice betrayed her. "Max, he knows. He knows everything."

"Doesn't matter." He pulled her to her feet, positioning himself between her and Viktor. "Can you walk?"

"Yes."

Viktor laughed, a bitter sound. "Touching. The American hero and his recruited whore. You think this ends here? You think—"

Max's fist connected with Viktor's jaw before he could finish, a sharp crack that sent the older man sprawling across his desk. The gun fell from Viktor's hand, and Rodriguez kicked it away.

"Zip him," Max ordered, already moving Elena toward the door.

The hallway was chaos. Two more of Viktor's security team lay motionless on the runner, and Carter was engaged with a third near the staircase, the two men grappling for control of a knife. Max fired once, dropping the hostile, and Carter nodded his thanks.

"Exfil, now!" Max commanded.

They moved as a unit, Max with Elena tucked against his side, her arm around his waist. She stumbled on the stairs, and he caught her, practically lifting her down the steps. Behind them, Rodriguez emerged from the study, Viktor zip-tied and being dragged along, still conscious, still cursing in Russian.

The foyer was a war zone—overturned furniture, bullet holes in the walls, blood on the marble. Max's mind catalogued it all automatically, threat assessment running on autopilot while his focus narrowed to a single imperative: get Elena out.

They burst through the shattered front door into the cold night air. The extraction van idled at the curb, rear doors open, engine running. Max could hear sirens in the distance—police, probably, responding to reports of gunfire in this upscale neighborhood.

"Go, go!" He pushed Elena toward the van, and she climbed in, turning immediately to look back at him with those dark eyes that had haunted him since the day they'd recruited her.

Carter and Rodriguez threw Viktor into the van after her, then jumped in themselves. Max was last, slamming the doors shut as the driver hit the gas.

The van lurched forward, tires squealing. Max fell into the seat beside Elena, breathing hard, adrenaline still singing through his veins. She was staring at him, tears cutting tracks through the dust and blood on her face.

"You came," she said, voice breaking.

"Always." He cupped her face gently, mindful of the bruise. "I'll always come for you."

She kissed him then, desperate and fierce, tasting of copper and fear and relief. When they broke apart, Viktor was watching them from across the van, his eyes cold despite the blood soaking his expensive shirt.

"This isn't over," Viktor said quietly. "You've just started a war you can't win."

Max met his gaze without flinching. "We'll see."

As the van raced through the darkened streets, Max pulled Elena close, feeling her heartbeat against his chest, rapid and alive. They'd gotten her out. The operation was blown, their cover compromised, and the fallout would be catastrophic.

But she was alive.

For now, that was enough.
