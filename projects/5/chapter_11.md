## Chapter 11: Safe House

**Scene 1: Max and Elena arrive at the CI...**

**Scene 1: Max and Elena arrive at the CIA safe house**

The gravel crunched beneath the tires as the black Mercedes wound through the pre-dawn darkness, headlights cutting pale swaths through the mist that clung to the Austrian countryside. Max pressed his forehead against the cool window glass, watching skeletal trees blur past, their branches reaching like gnarled fingers toward a sky just beginning to lighten from black to charcoal.

Beside him, Elena sat rigid, her hands folded in her lap. She hadn't spoken since they'd crossed the border an hour ago. The silence between them felt different now—weighted, fragile. Not the comfortable quiet of shared purpose, but something that might shatter if either of them spoke.

Max wanted to reach for her hand. He didn't.

The car slowed, turning onto an unmarked dirt road barely visible between the trees. Through the windshield, a stone farmhouse materialized from the gloom, its windows dark except for a single light burning above the entrance. Ivy climbed the weathered walls. A barn sagged nearby. To anyone passing by—if anyone ever passed by this far from civilization—it would look abandoned, forgotten.

That was the point.

The driver, who hadn't said a word during the entire journey, pulled up to the entrance and killed the engine. The sudden silence was absolute. No birdsong yet. No wind. Just the tick of cooling metal and Max's own heartbeat pulsing in his ears.

The front door opened. Two figures emerged, backlit by the interior light—broad-shouldered men in tactical gear, weapons visible but not drawn. Professional. Efficient. The kind of men who wouldn't hesitate if given the order.

"This is it," Max said quietly. His first words in an hour.

Elena turned to look at him, and in the dim light, her eyes were unreadable. "Max—"

The car door opened. Cold air rushed in, carrying the scent of wet earth and pine.

"Mr. Monroe." One of the security personnel leaned down, his face impassive. "If you'll come with me, please."

Max climbed out, his legs stiff from the drive, the adrenaline that had sustained him through the escape finally beginning to ebb. He heard Elena's door open on the other side of the vehicle. Heard her boots hit the gravel.

He tried to catch her eye over the roof of the car, but one of the men was already there, a polite but firm hand gesturing her toward the house. She moved like someone walking to an execution—shoulders back, chin up, but with that barely perceptible hesitation in her step.

"This way, Ms. Volkov," the second agent said.

"Wait." Max started around the car.

A hand caught his elbow. Not rough, but immovable. "Sir, you'll need to come with me. Standard protocol. You'll both be debriefed separately."

"I know the protocol," Max said, sharper than he intended. "Just give us a minute."

"I'm afraid that's not possible."

Elena had stopped walking. She stood in the gravel drive, the mist swirling around her ankles, looking back at him. The distance between them couldn't have been more than twenty feet, but it felt like miles. Her expression was carefully neutral, but he could see the tension in her jaw, the way her fingers had curled into fists at her sides.

"It's fine," she called out, her voice steady. Professional. The voice of someone who'd been through debriefings before, who knew how these things worked. "I'll see you on the other side."

*Will you?* Max thought but didn't say.

Because suddenly he wasn't sure. Suddenly, standing in this anonymous gravel drive with armed men separating them, the full weight of what they'd done—what *he'd* done by bringing her in—crashed down on him. She was a Russian intelligence officer who'd just betrayed her country. He was a CIA operative who'd broken every rule in the book to get her out.

And now she was walking into a building full of people who would have every reason to doubt her, to question her, to wonder if this whole thing had been an elaborate setup.

"Elena—"

But she'd already turned away, following her escort up the stone steps. The door swallowed her, and she was gone.

"Mr. Monroe." The hand on his elbow tightened slightly. "Please."

Max let himself be guided toward a different entrance, around the side of the building. His handler—he was already thinking of the man that way—produced a keycard, swiped it through a reader that looked far too modern for the rustic exterior. The lock clicked.

Inside, the farmhouse aesthetic disappeared entirely. Reinforced walls. Security cameras. The antiseptic smell of a government facility. His boots squeaked on linoleum as they walked down a narrow corridor, past closed doors with numbered placards.

They stopped at Room 3. The handler opened it, gestured inside.

"Someone will be with you shortly. There's water and coffee. Bathroom's through there." He pointed to a door in the corner. "I'll need your weapon and your phone."

Max handed over his Glock and the encrypted cell without argument. Standard procedure. He stepped into the room—windowless, furnished with a metal table, two chairs, and a couch that had seen better days. The door closed behind him with a decisive click.

He was alone.

Max stood in the center of the room, still wearing his jacket, still feeling the phantom weight of his gun at his hip. Somewhere in this building, Elena was in a room just like this one. Being processed. Being evaluated. Being—

He forced himself to stop. To breathe. To trust that the intelligence she'd risked everything to bring out would speak for itself.

But as he sank onto the couch, exhaustion finally crashing over him like a wave, one thought kept circling back:

What if it wasn't enough?

**Scene 2: Sarah Chen arrives and confron...**

**Scene 2: Sarah Chen arrives and confronts Max**

The briefing room smelled of stale coffee and antiseptic, its gray walls bare except for a single clock that ticked with mechanical indifference. Max sat at the steel table, his fingers drumming an irregular pattern on the cold surface, when the door slammed open hard enough to rattle the frame.

Sarah Chen strode in like a thunderstorm given human form.

She didn't sit. Didn't even pause. Her heels clicked sharp staccato beats on the linoleum as she crossed to the table and slapped a manila folder down so hard that Max's untouched coffee cup jumped.

"Do you have any idea," she said, her voice low and deadly, "what you've done?"

Max met her gaze. "I extracted an asset who—"

"An *unauthorized* extraction." Sarah's eyes blazed. "You went completely off-protocol. No clearance. No backup plan. No diplomatic cover. The Vienna station chief spent the last four hours explaining to the Austrian intelligence service why one of our contractors staged what looked like a kidnapping in their capital."

"Elena's life was—"

"I don't care." Sarah finally sat, leaning forward with her hands flat on the table. "You don't make those calls, Max. You report. You wait for authorization. You follow the goddamn chain of command."

The clock ticked. Three seconds. Four.

Max's jaw tightened. "She had maybe six hours before Viktor's people found her. You want me to apologize for not letting her die while I filed paperwork?"

"I want you to understand that you don't get to play cowboy with international incidents!" Sarah's voice rose, controlled fury crackling through every syllable. "We have protocols for a reason. Deniability. Diplomatic channels. You just burned through all of them because you decided your judgment was more important than operational security."

"My judgment kept Elena alive."

"Your judgment compromised an entire network!" Sarah yanked open the folder, pulling out photographs—surveillance stills of Max and Elena at the train station, grainy but unmistakable. "Russian intelligence has these. So does the FSB. So does every foreign service that monitors Vienna Central. Your face is now flagged in half a dozen databases as a hostile operative."

Max stared at the photos. His reflection looked back, frozen mid-motion, Elena's hand in his.

"I'd do it again," he said quietly.

Sarah's laugh was sharp and humorless. "Of course you would. Because Max Monroe doesn't think about consequences. Doesn't consider that maybe—just maybe—there are people whose job it is to weigh risks and make strategic decisions."

"Strategic decisions." Max stood abruptly, his chair scraping back. "Is that what we're calling it when we leave sources to die? When we sacrifice people who trusted us because extraction isn't 'strategically optimal'?"

"Don't you dare." Sarah rose to match him, her small frame radiating coiled intensity. "Don't you dare make this about moral high ground. You know what happens when operations go sideways without authorization? People get killed. Stations get compromised. Wars start over less."

"Elena had intelligence that—"

"I've read the preliminary debrief." Sarah's voice dropped back to ice. "I know what she brought. And yes, it's significant. Potentially game-changing. But that doesn't excuse the fact that you created a diplomatic nightmare and put yourself—and this agency—in an impossible position."

The ventilation system hummed in the silence that followed. Max could feel his pulse in his temples, adrenaline still coursing from the extraction mixing with frustration that tasted like copper on his tongue.

"So what now?" he asked. "You pull me? Send me home?"

Sarah studied him for a long moment, her expression unreadable. When she spoke, her voice carried a weariness that aged her ten years.

"What I *should* do is put you on the first flight to Langley for a disciplinary review." She gathered the photographs, sliding them back into the folder with precise movements. "What I'm *going to* do is let you sit here and think about whether following orders is really such an unreasonable request."

She moved toward the door, then paused with her hand on the handle.

"The documents Elena brought—they're being analyzed now. If they're as valuable as she claims, it might save your career." Sarah's eyes found his again, hard and unforgiving. "But don't mistake operational success for approval, Max. You broke protocol. You went rogue. And there will be consequences."

The door closed behind her with a final, definitive click.

Max stood alone in the gray room, the clock's ticking suddenly loud in his ears, and wondered if doing the right thing was supposed to feel this much like falling.

**Scene 3: Sarah reviews the documents El...**

**Scene 3: Sarah reviews the documents Elena obtained**

The analysis room smelled of burnt coffee and electronic equipment. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting harsh white light across the steel table where Sarah Chen spread the documents like a dealer arranging cards. Her hands moved with precision, sorting photographs from financial records, encrypted communications from personnel files.

Max stood against the far wall, arms crossed, watching her work. The adrenaline from Vienna had finally worn off, leaving him hollow and exhausted. His shoulder throbbed where he'd slammed into the door frame during their escape.

Sarah hadn't spoken to him in twenty minutes. The silence was worse than her earlier tirade.

A young CIA analyst—Thompson, maybe? Max couldn't remember—sat at a laptop, photographing each document and running preliminary scans. The click of the camera shutter punctuated the quiet like a metronome counting down to judgment.

"This one," Sarah said suddenly, her voice tight. She held up a photograph of a man in a business suit shaking hands with someone Max recognized from intelligence briefings. "When was this taken?"

Thompson zoomed in on the metadata. "Three weeks ago. Brussels."

Sarah's jaw clenched. She set the photo down and picked up a financial ledger, her eyes scanning the columns of numbers. Her finger traced a line of transactions, then stopped. Her breathing changed—shallow, controlled.

"Max." His name came out quiet. Dangerous quiet.

He pushed off the wall. "Yeah?"

"Come here."

He approached the table. Sarah pointed to a series of account numbers, then to a corresponding document—a personnel roster with names highlighted in yellow.

"Do you see this?" She wasn't looking at him. Her eyes were fixed on the papers, but her knuckles had gone white where she gripped the edge of the table.

Max leaned closer. The account numbers were routing funds through a network of shell corporations. The names on the roster included mid-level officials from five different intelligence services. British. German. French. Two he didn't recognize.

"Jesus," Thompson whispered.

Sarah pulled another document from the stack—a communications log. Her hands were shaking now, just slightly. Max had never seen Sarah Chen's hands shake.

"This isn't just Viktor's network," she said. "This is..." She trailed off, spreading more documents across the table. A web of connections emerged. Corporate executives. Politicians. Military contractors. Each document linked to another, creating a pattern that made Max's stomach drop.

Sarah grabbed a red marker and began drawing lines between photographs, connecting faces to names to transactions. The marker squeaked against the glossy paper. Her movements became faster, more urgent, as the scope of what they were seeing crystallized.

"My God." She stepped back from the table, the marker falling from her fingers. "This goes back fifteen years. Maybe longer."

Thompson's face had gone pale. "Ma'am, if this is accurate—"

"It's accurate." Sarah's voice was hollow. She turned to look at Max for the first time since they'd entered the room. The fury in her eyes had transformed into something else. Something that looked almost like fear. "Elena gave you everything. Names. Transactions. Communications. This is..." She gestured helplessly at the table.

"Proof," Max said.

"Proof of a coordinated espionage operation spanning multiple governments and private sectors." Sarah picked up a document with trembling hands. "They're not just stealing intelligence. They're trading it. Selling it. Creating a parallel information economy that operates completely outside official channels."

Max moved closer to the table, studying the web of connections. "How many people are involved?"

Thompson was typing frantically. "Based on these documents? Conservatively? Two hundred. Maybe more."

Sarah laughed—a sharp, bitter sound. "And we had no idea. None of us." She looked at Max again, and this time there was something new in her expression. Respect, maybe. Or the grudging acknowledgment of someone who'd been proven wrong. "You risked everything for this."

"Elena risked everything," Max corrected.

"Elena wouldn't have gotten near this without you." Sarah gathered the documents, her professional composure reassembling itself like armor. "This changes everything. The entire operation. The entire investigation." She paused, her fingers resting on a photograph of Viktor standing with three men Max didn't recognize. "We're not hunting one asset anymore. We're looking at a full-scale infiltration."

The weight of it settled over the room like a physical presence. Thompson had stopped typing, his eyes wide behind his glasses.

Sarah pulled out her phone. "I need to make some calls. Secure calls." She looked at Max. "You're still reckless. Still insubordinate. Still a pain in my ass."

"But?"

"But you just handed us the biggest intelligence coup in a decade." She moved toward the door, then stopped. "Get some rest. Both of you. When this hits headquarters, things are going to move fast."

She left, her footsteps echoing down the corridor.

Thompson let out a long breath. "Holy shit."

Max stared at the documents spread across the table—the evidence of a conspiracy so vast it made his previous missions seem like training exercises. Somewhere in Vienna, Elena was in the wind, carrying secrets that could bring down governments.

And somewhere in this web of lies and betrayal, there was still a truth waiting to be uncovered.

His phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number: *One hour. Come alone.*

Max's blood went cold. He recognized the code. It was Elena's emergency protocol.

She was reaching out.

And she was in trouble.

**Scene 4: Max is finally allowed to see ...**

**Scene 4: Max is finally allowed to see Elena**

The hallway stretched longer than it should have, each footstep on the worn hardwood echoing too loudly in Max's ears. Sarah had given him ten minutes—a concession delivered with the warmth of a prison warden granting yard time.

The safe house bedroom was at the end of the corridor, third door on the left. Max counted them as he passed. One. Two. Three. His hand hesitated on the brass knob, suddenly cold despite the building's efficient heating.

He knocked softly. No answer.

"Elena? It's me."

A pause, then her voice, barely audible: "Come in."

The room was spartan—a single bed with military-crisp white sheets, a wooden chair, a dresser with nothing on it. The window had been covered with blackout curtains, but afternoon light leaked around the edges in thin golden lines. The air smelled of institutional soap and something else—the faint, acrid scent of fear.

Elena sat on the edge of the bed, still wearing the clothes from Vienna. Her hair, usually so carefully styled, hung loose around her shoulders. She'd washed her face; he could see water droplets still clinging to her hairline. Without makeup, she looked younger. More vulnerable.

She didn't look up when he entered.

Max closed the door behind him, the latch clicking with a finality that made his chest tighten. He wanted to cross the room, to pull her into his arms, but something in her posture—shoulders curved inward, hands clasped tight in her lap—kept him rooted near the door.

"They treating you okay?" he asked. Stupid question. Safe.

"They gave me tea." She gestured to an untouched cup on the nightstand, steam no longer rising from it. "English breakfast. Not Russian."

The observation landed like a stone between them.

Max moved closer, slowly, as if approaching something wild and wounded. The floorboard creaked under his weight. "Elena—"

"I had a cat," she said suddenly, her voice flat. "Misha. A gray tabby. I've had him for six years. He waits by the door every evening at seven when I come home from work." Her fingers twisted together. "Who will feed him now?"

The mundane detail hit harder than any recrimination. Max sank into the wooden chair, its joints protesting. "We can arrange—"

"No." She finally looked at him, and the emptiness in her eyes made his breath catch. "You don't understand. There is no arrangement. There is no going back. My apartment, my job, my friends, my cat—" Her voice cracked on the last word. "Gone. All of it. Because I chose to walk out of that restaurant with you."

"You chose to do the right thing."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "The right thing." She stood abruptly, wrapping her arms around herself. "My mother is seventy-three. She lives in Novosibirsk. Every Sunday, I call her. What do I tell her now? 'Sorry, Mama, I'm a traitor to the Motherland, you'll never see me again'?"

Max rose, closing the distance between them. "You're not a traitor. You exposed criminals—"

"To you, they are criminals." Elena's voice rose, trembling with suppressed emotion. "To Moscow, I am the criminal. To the FSB, to Viktor's people—" She pressed her palms against her temples. "Do you know what they do to defectors' families? The surveillance, the pressure, the—"

"We'll protect her. We can bring her out—"

"Stop!" The word came out as almost a shout. Elena's composure finally shattered. Her shoulders shook, tears streaming down her face. "Stop making promises you cannot keep. Stop pretending this is anything other than what it is. I am burned. Finished. Everything I was, everything I built—I left it all on that Vienna street."

Max reached for her, and this time she didn't pull away. She collapsed against him, her body wracked with silent sobs. He wrapped his arms around her, feeling the violent tremors running through her frame. Her tears soaked into his shirt, warm and wet.

"I'm sorry," he whispered into her hair. "God, Elena, I'm so sorry."

They sank together onto the edge of the bed. Elena's fingers clutched at his jacket, holding on as if he were the only solid thing in a tilting world. Max held her tighter, his own throat constricting with guilt that tasted like copper.

He'd done this to her. Yes, she'd made the choice—but he'd pushed her toward it, manipulated the circumstances, played on her conscience and her attraction to him. The intelligence was good, Sarah had said. The best they'd had in years. But what was it worth? What was any of it worth against the weight of this woman's destroyed life?

"I didn't even pack a photograph," Elena said against his chest, her voice muffled and broken. "Not one picture of my mother. Of my life. I have nothing."

"You have me." The words came out before Max could stop them.

Elena pulled back slightly, looking up at him with red-rimmed eyes. "For how long? Until the next operation? The next asset who needs running?" She touched his face, her fingers cold against his jaw. "This is what you do, Max. You collect broken people and use their pieces to build your cases."

"That's not—" But he couldn't finish the denial. Wasn't it true? How many assets had he run over the years? How many lives had he disrupted, redirected, destroyed in service of the mission?

"I'm not sorry I did it," Elena said quietly. "The network Viktor built—it needed to be stopped. People were dying. But don't ask me to pretend it doesn't cost everything. Don't ask me to be brave about losing my entire world."

Max cupped her face in his hands, thumbs brushing away tears that kept falling. "I won't. And I won't leave you alone in this. Whatever comes next—"

"You can't promise that either."

"I can promise to try."

Elena's laugh was watery, exhausted. "The American optimist."

"The Russian realist."

She leaned her forehead against his, and they stayed like that, breathing together in the sparse room. Outside, Max could hear the muffled sounds of the safe house—footsteps, a door closing, the hum of secure communications equipment. The machinery of intelligence grinding forward.

"What happens now?" Elena asked.

"Now you rest. Tomorrow, Sarah will want to debrief you properly. Then... then we figure out what your new life looks like."

"A new life." She said it like a foreign phrase, testing the shape of it. "Who will I be?"

"Whoever you want to be."

"Liar." But there was no heat in it. She pulled away, wiping her eyes with the back of her hand. "You should go. They're probably timing you."

Max stood reluctantly. At the door, he paused. "The cat. Misha. Give me your keys and address. I'll make a call. Someone will look after him."

Elena's expression softened slightly. "That's a security risk."

"I don't care."

She almost smiled. Almost. "Thank you."

Max left her there, sitting on the edge of the anonymous bed in the anonymous room, looking small and lost and impossibly brave. The door closed behind him with a soft click.

In the hallway, he leaned against the wall and closed his eyes, Elena's tears still damp on his shirt, the weight of what he'd done settling into his bones like lead.

Sarah was waiting at the end of the corridor, arms crossed, expression unreadable.

"Time's up," she said.

Max nodded and followed her back toward the debriefing room, leaving Elena alone with the ghost of her old life and the terrifying blank space of her future.

**Scene 5: During a joint debriefing, Sar...**

**Scene 5: During a joint debriefing, Sarah questions Elena extensively about Viktor's network and her knowledge of his operations**

The briefing room smelled of strong coffee and tension. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting harsh shadows across the long conference table where Sarah Chen sat with her laptop open and a legal pad covered in precise handwriting. A digital recorder sat between her and Elena, its red light blinking steadily.

Max leaned against the wall near the door, arms crossed, watching. A CIA debriefer named Garrett occupied the corner, fingers flying across his keyboard as he documented everything.

Sarah hadn't looked at Max once in the past forty minutes.

"Let's go back to the Prague meeting," Sarah said, her voice clinical. "March 2023. You said Viktor met with someone from the German finance ministry."

Elena sat perfectly straight in her chair, hands folded on the table. She'd changed into borrowed clothes—dark jeans and a plain sweater that made her look younger, more vulnerable. But her eyes were sharp, focused.

"Not from the ministry. A contractor who worked with them. There's a difference."

"Name?"

"He introduced himself as Klaus. Viktor called him something else later, when he thought I wasn't listening." Elena paused, her gaze distant. "Dieter. Dieter Hauptmann."

Garrett's typing stopped. Sarah's pen froze mid-note.

"You're certain?" Sarah asked.

"I'm certain of what I heard." Elena's voice remained steady. "Viktor had been drinking. We were in the hotel suite. He made a call from the bedroom, but the door was open. He said, 'Dieter, you paranoid bastard, using fake names with me now?'"

Sarah exchanged a glance with Garrett, who was already pulling up something on his screen. Max shifted his weight, recognizing the significance even if he didn't know the details.

"Hauptmann has been on our radar for eighteen months," Sarah said quietly. "We've never been able to place him anywhere definitively."

"I can place him in Prague. Vienna twice. Once in Zurich." Elena ticked them off on her fingers. "I have dates. I kept a journal."

The room went very still.

"You kept a journal," Sarah repeated, her tone carefully neutral. "Of Viktor's meetings."

"Not of the meetings. Of my life." Elena met Sarah's gaze without flinching. "A woman in my position learns to notice things. To remember. It's survival."

Max found himself standing straighter. This was a different Elena than the frightened woman in the warehouse, different even from the determined one who'd made her choice in the car. This Elena was revealing herself layer by layer—intelligent, observant, strategic.

Sarah leaned forward slightly. "What else did you notice?"

"Viktor keeps two phones. The iPhone is for show—business calls, restaurants, his legitimate operations. The Samsung is encrypted. He only uses it in private, or what he thinks is private." Elena's mouth curved slightly, not quite a smile. "He underestimated how much I pay attention. The Samsung contacts are coded. 'Architect' is someone in Brussels. 'Gardener' is Moscow. 'Chef' is the one he's most careful about—always steps outside, always speaks in Russian."

"Can you identify any of these people?" Garrett asked, speaking for the first time.

"Some. The Architect met us for dinner once in Brussels. Viktor called him by name then—Alain Mercier. He works for the European Commission, something to do with infrastructure contracts."

Sarah was writing rapidly now, her earlier coldness replaced by intense focus. "What about the financial structure? Did Viktor ever discuss how money moved through his network?"

"Not directly. But I saw documents sometimes. He was careless when he'd been drinking, left his laptop open." Elena's voice dropped slightly. "Shell companies in Cyprus, Cayman Islands, Singapore. Money moving in circles. He had a diagram once, on his screen. Like a web, with nodes and connections."

"Could you recreate it?"

Elena looked at her hands, then back up. "I think so. Not perfectly, but the general structure. I have a good memory for patterns."

Max watched Sarah's expression shift—the grudging respect breaking through her professional mask. This wasn't just a frightened trophy wife looking for escape. This was an intelligence asset who'd been gathering information for years, whether she'd consciously realized it or not.

"Why didn't you come to us before?" Sarah asked, and for the first time, there was something almost gentle in her voice.

Elena was quiet for a long moment. The fluorescent lights hummed. Somewhere in the safe house, a door closed.

"Because I was afraid," she said finally. "And because I didn't know if I could trust anyone. Viktor has people everywhere. He's told me that since the beginning—that he has friends in every government, every agency. That no one could protect me if I ran."

"And now?"

Elena looked at Max, then back to Sarah. "Now I'm more afraid of what happens if I don't run. And I think..." She paused, choosing her words carefully. "I think maybe I've been preparing to run for longer than I admitted to myself. Noticing things. Remembering. Building a case in my head."

Sarah closed her laptop with a soft click. "Elena, I'm going to be direct with you. What you know, what you can provide—it's valuable. Extremely valuable. But it also makes you a target. Viktor won't stop looking for you. Neither will the people he works with."

"I know."

"We can protect you. Witness protection, new identity, relocation. But it means leaving everything behind. Completely."

"Everything I had was built on lies," Elena said quietly. "I'm ready to leave it."

Sarah nodded slowly, then finally looked at Max. Her expression was complicated—still angry, but also acknowledging something unspoken.

"Take a break," she said. "Fifteen minutes. Then we're going to go through everything again, this time with our Russian desk specialist on video call. It's going to be a long night."

Elena stood, steadier than she'd been hours ago. Max pushed off from the wall, ready to escort her out, but she paused at the door.

"Ms. Chen?" Elena's voice was clear. "Thank you for listening. For believing me."

Sarah's expression softened fractionally. "Thank you for being brave enough to speak."

As they left the briefing room, Max heard Garrett's low whistle and Sarah's murmured response: "This changes everything."

In the hallway, Elena leaned against the wall, closing her eyes briefly. Max stood nearby, giving her space but staying close.

"You did well in there," he said.

She opened her eyes, looking at him with something that might have been amusement. "You sound surprised."

"Not surprised. Impressed."

"I've spent five years watching, listening, surviving." Her voice was soft but firm. "I learned to be more than what Viktor wanted me to be. More than what anyone saw."

Before Max could respond, footsteps approached from the far end of the hall. Sarah appeared, phone in hand, her expression urgent.

"Break's over," she said. "We just got word. Viktor's people are making moves. We need everything Elena knows, and we need it now."

The determination in Elena's eyes hardened to something stronger.

"Then let's get back to work," she said, and walked back into the briefing room with her head high.

**Scene 6: Late that night, Sarah private...**

**Scene 6: Late that night, Sarah privately tells Max that Elena will need to enter witness protection**

The safe house had settled into uneasy quiet by the time Sarah knocked on Max's door. Through the frosted glass of the temporary office she'd commandeered, he could see her silhouette—rigid, controlled, waiting.

"Come in, Max."

He found her standing by the window, looking out at the dark Austrian countryside. A single desk lamp cast long shadows across the sparse room. The smell of stale coffee hung in the air, mixing with the faint scent of her perfume—something expensive and cold, like her demeanor.

She didn't turn around. "Close the door."

Max obeyed, his gut tightening. This wasn't another debriefing. Those had ended hours ago, with Sarah's clipped acknowledgment that the documents Elena had secured were "actionable intelligence." High praise from a woman who rationed compliments like ammunition.

"Sit."

"I'd rather stand."

Sarah's shoulders tensed, but she continued staring into the darkness. "The documents Elena obtained have been verified. The network is larger than we imagined—politicians, military contractors, tech executives. All compromised. All vulnerable."

"Good."

"Good?" She turned then, and the lamplight caught the exhaustion in her eyes. "Max, do you understand what you've done? What *she's* done? There are people in three countries who want her dead right now. People with resources that make Viktor look like a street-level dealer."

Max's jaw tightened. "Then we protect her."

"We will." Sarah moved to the desk, her fingers drumming once against the wood—a rare tell of agitation. "She'll enter witness protection. New identity, new location. Probably the States. Definitely nowhere near Europe."

The words hit him like a physical blow, though he'd known they were coming. Had known since the moment Elena handed over those files that this was the logical conclusion. The only conclusion.

"When?"

"Seventy-two hours. Maybe less, depending on how quickly the threat assessment develops." Sarah's gaze pinned him. "And Max, I need to be absolutely clear about this: once she enters the program, all contact ends. No calls. No emails. No accidentally running into her in some café in Prague. It's over."

"She hasn't agreed to this."

"She will. Because she's smart enough to understand that it's either witness protection or a bullet." Sarah's voice softened, just slightly. "I've seen the way you look at her. And I've seen the way she looks at you. Which is why I'm having this conversation now, privately, instead of in front of the team."

Max's hands curled into fists at his sides. Through the window behind Sarah, he could see the safe house's perimeter lights cutting geometric patterns into the night. Armed guards walked their routes with mechanical precision. Everything controlled. Everything contained.

"There has to be another way."

"There isn't." Sarah moved closer, her expression hardening. "You want to know what happens if you try to follow her? If you compromise her location? You get her killed. You get yourself killed. And you burn every asset we have in the field because our enemies will know exactly how sloppy we've become."

"I'm not asking to compromise—"

"Yes, you are." Her voice cracked like a whip. "That's exactly what you're asking. You're asking for an exception. For special treatment. For the rules not to apply because you have *feelings*."

The contempt in that last word stung more than Max wanted to admit.

Sarah returned to the window, her reflection ghostly in the glass. "I've been doing this for seventeen years. Do you know how many operatives I've seen burn out because they couldn't separate the job from their personal lives? How many good agents I've lost because they thought they could have both?"

"And how many did you lose because they had nothing left to fight for?"

The silence stretched between them, heavy and suffocating. Outside, an owl called into the darkness.

When Sarah spoke again, her voice was barely above a whisper. "I had someone once. An analyst. Brilliant mind, terrible tradecraft. We tried to make it work." She touched the window, her fingers leaving faint prints on the cold glass. "He died in Beirut because I was three minutes late to an extraction. Three minutes, Max. I was saying goodbye to a source, securing one last piece of intel. Three minutes."

Max felt something shift in his chest—not sympathy, exactly, but recognition. The weight Sarah carried wasn't just professional. It was personal. Ancient. Unhealed.

"I'm sorry."

"Don't be sorry. Be smart." She turned, and her eyes were flint. "You're at a crossroads. Follow protocol, lose Elena, but keep her alive. Or try to find 'another way' and watch her die because you were too selfish to let her go."

"Those aren't the only options."

"They're the only ones that matter."

Max moved to the door, his hand on the knob. The metal was cold beneath his palm, solid and real. Everything else felt like quicksand.

"The enemies looking for us," he said quietly. "How long before they find this location?"

Sarah's expression flickered—surprise, then calculation. "We're secure here for now. Why?"

"Because if they're already searching, then the seventy-two-hour window might be optimistic."

"We have protocols—"

"Protocols didn't stop them from finding us in Vienna. Didn't stop them from tracking Elena to the embassy." Max met her gaze. "You said the network is bigger than we imagined. Which means the leaks are bigger too. Which means someone, somewhere in our chain of command, is compromised."

Sarah's silence was answer enough.

Max opened the door, cold air from the hallway rushing in. "I'll follow your protocols, Sarah. I'll say goodbye when the time comes. But until then, I'm going to make damn sure Elena survives long enough to make it to witness protection."

"Max—"

"And if I find out someone on our side is feeding information to the people hunting her?" He paused in the doorway, his voice dropping to something dark and certain. "Protocol won't save them from me."

He left before Sarah could respond, the door clicking shut behind him with quiet finality.

In the hallway, Max leaned against the wall, his heart hammering. Through a window at the corridor's end, he could see the guest room where Elena was sleeping—or trying to. A single light burned in her window.

Seventy-two hours. Maybe less.

The dread settled over him like a familiar coat, but beneath it, something else stirred. Resolve. Cold and sharp as a blade.

Sarah was right about one thing: he was at a crossroads.

But she was wrong about the choices available to him.

Max pushed off the wall and headed toward the safe house's communications room, his mind already working through the angles, the contacts, the favors he could call in. Somewhere in the web of intelligence and counter-intelligence, there had to be a third option. A way to keep Elena safe without losing her completely.

He just had to find it before their enemies found them first.

Behind him, Sarah's office light went dark.

The clock was already ticking.
