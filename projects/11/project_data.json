    "description": "In a near-future society where memories can be digitally extracted and stored, 32-year-old Aria Chen works as a Memory Curator at the National Archive. Her job is routine—cataloging, preserving, and occasionally restoring corrupted memory files—until she stumbles upon a classified collection that shouldn't exist. These memories reveal a coordinated effort to erase a pivotal moment from collective history, one that would expose the true origins of the current government. As Aria digs deeper, she discovers she possesses a rare neurological condition that allows her to not just view memories, but enter and experience them as if they were her own. This gift becomes a curse when she learns that the conspiracy reaches into her own family's past, and that her late mother may have been killed to protect these secrets. Now, powerful forces know what Aria has discovered, and she must navigate a dangerous world of memory black markets, corporate espionage, and political intrigue. With the help of a disillusioned government agent and a underground network of 'memory runners,' Aria races to expose the truth before her own memories—and her identity—are permanently erased. But as she uncovers layer after layer of deception, she faces an impossible question: is truth always worth the cost, or are some memories too dangerous to remember?",
