## Chapter 2: Forbidden Compassion

**Scene 1: The Weight of Stolen Memory**

The neural archive chamber hummed with a frequency just below conscious perception, a sound that Inanna felt more than heard—a vibration that settled into her bones like the echo of forgotten prayers. She stood before the crystalline interface, her fingers hovering above the luminescent surface, hesitating.

*You shouldn't be here.*

The thought came unbidden, accompanied by the phantom taste of something she hadn't experienced in 3000 years. Something earthy. Something *human*.

Bread. It had been bread.

Inanna closed her eyes, and the memory surged forward like a tide she could no longer hold back.

---

*She was young then—barely past her first century, still grappling with the weighty responsibilities of her lineage, the vast gulf between Anunnaki expectations and her burgeoning empathy. The incident began not as a deliberate act of rebellion, but as a flicker of insatiable curiosity. The Earth, teeming with burgeoning life, pulsed with a vibrant energy the sterile space station could never replicate.*

*Drawn by an unexplainable magnetism, Inanna commandeered a maintenance pod, its unauthorized descent a clandestine exploration masked as a routine systems check. The Primordial Jungle sprawled beneath her, a chaotic tapestry of greens and browns that dwarfed the rigidly ordered Edin Basin. Landing near a small, isolated human settlement, she intended only to observe, to understand the beings her people dismissed as mere tools.*

*The settlement was wretched. Makeshift shelters cobbled together from scavenged materials, the air thick with the stench of deprivation. Humans, their bodies bearing the marks of exhaustion and malnourishment, moved with a weary resignation that chilled Inanna despite her environmental suit.*

*Then she saw her.*

*A girl, no older than seven cycles, sat alone near a cluster of mud huts. Clutched in her small hands was a dark, coarse loaf of bread. She broke off a piece, her movements deliberate as if rationing a precious treasure, and ate it slowly. Her clothes hung loosely on her thin frame, stained with the dust of the earth, but her eyes... her eyes held an unnerving clarity.*

*Inanna’s suit, designed for seamless camouflage, flickered momentarily, betraying her presence. An equipment malfunction, she would later rationalize, or perhaps some latent desire to be seen.*

*The girl looked up, her gaze unwavering. She did not cower, nor scream. Instead, she extended a hand, offering a piece of the bread.*

"You look hungry," she said, her voice soft but clear, cutting through the static of Inanna's translation implant. "Your eyes are sad like hungry."

The words, the gesture, struck Inanna with the force of a physical blow. Anunnaki did not hunger in the way humans did. Sustenance came through energy conversion, a sterile process devoid of taste or sensation. Yet, looking at the child's gaunt face, at the offering in her outstretched hand, Inanna understood a different kind of hunger—a hunger for connection, for empathy, for something more than the cold, calculated existence of her people.

Drawn by an impulse she couldn't explain, Inanna accepted the bread. It was heavy, dense, almost inedible. The taste was unfamiliar, a mix of rough grains and earthy bitterness that her body instinctively rejected. Later, her systems would labor to expel the foreign substance, treating it like a toxin. But in that moment, standing before the child with the weight of centuries of Anunnaki superiority pressing down on her shoulders, Inanna ate.

"I'm Mira," the child said, her voice devoid of fear. "What's your name?"

The protocols screamed in Inanna's mind. *Do not engage. Do not reveal your identity. Observe and report.* But the child’s simple act of generosity had pierced through the rigid layers of Anunnaki conditioning.

"Inanna," she replied, the name feeling alien on her tongue, a violation of every rule she had ever known.

Mira smiled, a genuine expression of warmth that radiated from her like sunlight. "That's pretty. Like music."

They sat together for what felt like an eternity. Mira spoke of the settlement, of the daily struggle for survival, of the dreams and fears of her people. She pointed out a young boy sketching patterns in the dirt, explaining his obsession with the stars, his desire to build a flying machine. She whispered tales of a wild child raised by apes, a creature glimpsed at the edge of the jungle, his eyes reflecting the untamed spirit of the wilderness.

That wild child, Mira said, possessed an unnatural awareness of the forest. Animals seemed drawn to him, responding to his presence as if guided by an unseen force. It was said he could predict the coming of storms, that he could sense danger long before it arrived. She called him Tarzan.

Inanna listened, her translation implant struggling to keep pace with Mira's rapid-fire speech. With each word, with each gesture, something stirred within her. The sterile world of the Anunnaki, with its rigid hierarchies and its cold indifference, seemed to recede into the distance, replaced by a growing sense of connection to these vulnerable, resilient creatures.

As the shadows lengthened, Inanna knew she had to leave. The patrol drones would be scanning the sector soon, and her unauthorized presence would not go unnoticed.

She rose to her feet, her heart aching with a nameless sorrow.

"I have to go," she said, her voice barely audible.

Mira nodded, her eyes filled with an understanding beyond her years. "Will you come back?" she asked.

Inanna hesitated. She wanted to say yes, to promise to return and learn more about this world, about these people. But she knew it was a lie. Her duty lay with the Anunnaki, with the preservation of her own people.

"I don't know," she said, her voice heavy with regret.

Mira smiled, her expression accepting. "That's okay," she said. "Maybe someday, we'll meet again."

Inanna turned and fled, her environmental suit shimmering as she vanished back into the jungle. She never saw Mira again. Within three cycles, the settlement was gone, wiped out in a routine culling operation designed to eliminate unproductive populations. A mining accident, the official report stated. A tragic but necessary loss.

But the memory of Mira, of the bread, of the wild child Tarzan and the boy dreaming of stars, lingered in Inanna's mind, a persistent whisper that refused to be silenced. It was a reminder of the humanity she had almost forgotten, a seed of compassion that would one day blossom into rebellion.

---
*The faintest scent of earth and baking bread hung in the air for a moment longer, then faded.*

***Decades later, standing once more in the cold, sterile archive, the weight of that 3000-year-old encounter settled upon Inanna's shoulders. The faces of the doomed swam before her eyes.***

Inanna opened her eyes. The neural archive chamber materialized around her again, cold and sterile, humming its subliminal song. Her cheeks were wet—an autonomic response she'd thought she'd evolved beyond centuries ago.

She pressed her palm to the crystalline interface.

"Archive access," she whispered. "Genetic design protocols. Authorization: Inanna, Second Daughter of Anu."

The crystal pulsed red. *Access denied. Restricted by order of the Primary.*

Of course. Her father's paranoia extended even here, to the historical records of his own creations.

But Inanna hadn't come unprepared.

She reached into her robe and withdrew a small device—a gift from her brother Enki, pressed into her palm during a clandestine meeting in a restricted maintenance corridor three cycles ago. His hands had trembled as he gave it to her, his voice barely above a whisper: *"If you're determined to do this, at least be smart about it. This will mask your access signature, make it look like routine archive maintenance. You'll have maybe twelve minutes before the system notices the anomaly."*

Twelve minutes to find the truth about what humanity really was.

Twelve minutes to discover whether her compassion had been spent on creatures designed for slaughter.

Inanna attached the device to the interface and watched the crystal shift from red to amber to green.

*Access granted.*

The chamber filled with light, and the secrets of humanity's creation began to unfold before her like a flower made of data and damnation.

**Scene 2: The Price of Truth**

Inanna, with the aid of the Igigi technician, successfully escaped the archive chamber and navigated through the station's maintenance tunnels. He guided her toward a hidden observation deck overlooking the shuttle bays. The journey was tense, fraught with the risk of detection, but Inanna's resolve grew stronger with each step closer to her goal. Finally, they reached the observation deck, a secluded vantage point that would allow Inanna to proceed to the next stage of her plan: securing transport to Earth.

They moved quickly, efficiently, like two pieces of a machine that had been designed to work together. The Igigi, whose designation was Overseer Trainee, knew the pod bay intimately, navigating the corridors and accessways with practiced ease. He guided Inanna through the station's labyrinthine maintenance tunnels, bypassing security checkpoints, avoiding patrol routes, masking their presence behind layers of technical jargon and fabricated work orders.

---

The adrenaline still coursed through Inanna's veins, a cold fire fueled by stolen knowledge and the gnawing fear of discovery. Each step through the labyrinthine corridors of the orbital station was a gamble, a silent prayer that their fabricated work orders and masked signatures would hold against the ever-watchful eyes of the Anunnaki security systems. The weight of the data she now possessed—the brutal truth of humanity's genetic manipulation and the planned extermination—pressed down on her, a heavy burden that amplified the urgency of their escape. Yet, even as they fled, Inanna knew this was only the beginning. Reaching Earth was paramount, but she couldn't shake the chilling realization that she was now a fugitive, hunted by her own kind, and carrying a truth that could shatter the foundations of their meticulously constructed world.

**Scene 3: The Eleventh Hour**

Inanna paced the small observation deck, the tension coiling tighter with each passing moment. The data streams cascading across Overseer Trainee's console blurred into meaningless symbols, each failed search a hammer blow against her dwindling hope. The hum of the shuttle bay, usually a comforting drone, now grated on her nerves, a constant reminder of the ticking clock.

She glanced at the mission timer displayed on her wrist. Seventeen hours remained until the Council vote, when her father could officially unleash the Tiamat Protocol. More critically, with three rotations of the station until the vote, each approximately four hours, that meant only eleven hours until the atmospheric entry window opened—her last chance to reach Earth before the hammer fell.

**Scene 4: The Stolen Shuttle**

Overseer Trainee slammed his fist on the console. "Damn it! All the shuttles are locked down. Override codes have been changed. I can't get us clearance to launch."

Inanna whirled on him, her eyes blazing. "There has to be a way. Think, Overseer Trainee. What did you used to do when the launch schedules were locked down and you needed to move a shuttle for unscheduled maintenance?"

He hesitated, his gaze darting around the observation deck as if searching for an escape. "Well, there was this one time… a faulty fuel line… I rerouted power, bypassed the automated diagnostics… but it was incredibly risky. If the system detected the anomaly, the entire bay could have been sealed, and I'd have been facing disciplinary action."

Inanna stepped closer, her voice low and urgent. "Disciplinary action is no longer a concern for either of us, Overseer Trainee. Now, tell me how you did it."
