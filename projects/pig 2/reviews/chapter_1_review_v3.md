3.  **Plot Holes**
    *   No issues found.

4.  **Redundancy**

    *   **Issue 1:** The story repeats Johnny's internal struggle and realization that he has to help Arnie. Scene 2, 3 and 5 each express that Johnny feels responsible for the pig. The repetition dilutes the emotional impact.

5.  **Flow and Transitions**
    *   No issues found.

6.  **Actionable Fixes**

    1.  **Scene 5 Redundancy Fix:** Condense the description of Johnny realizing he must help Arnie. Remove the line "He couldn't imagine doing it." Rephrase "The thought of Arnie alone, wandering the city, lost and vulnerable, twisted his stomach. No. He couldn't let that happen." to "The thought of Arnie alone in the city twisted his stomach."
