1.  **In Scene 1, after the flashback ends, slightly rephrase "The neural archive chamber materialized around her again, cold and sterile, humming its subliminal song. Her cheeks were wet—an autonomic response she'd thought she'd evolved beyond centuries ago." to "The neural archive chamber returned to her awareness, cold and sterile, humming its subliminal song. Her cheeks were wet—an autonomic response she'd thought she'd overridden centuries ago."** The original wording is technically accurate, but "materialized" is slightly odd and "evolved beyond" feels less precise than "overridden" given the technological context.
