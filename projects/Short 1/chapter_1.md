## Chapter 1: The First Pioneer

**Scene 1: The launch sequence begins at ...**

**Scene 1: The launch sequence begins at Cape Kennedy**

The observation glass felt cold against Sarah's palm, though the Florida sun had been beating against it since dawn. Below, the Saturn V stood wreathed in vapor, ice crystals cascading from its flanks like a waterfall frozen in reverse. Somewhere inside that tower of metal and fuel, three hundred feet above the launchpad, Bobby sat strapped into a capsule designed for a body that would never grow taller than four feet.

"T-minus ten minutes and counting."

The voice crackled through the control room speakers with the flat affect of a man reading a grocery list. Sarah's fingers curled against the glass. Behind her, the room hummed with controlled chaos—engineers monitoring readouts, technicians speaking in the clipped language of acronyms and numbers. The air conditioning couldn't quite mask the smell of coffee gone bitter in its pot, cigarette smoke, and something else. Fear, maybe. Or guilt.

"Biometric readings are nominal," someone reported. "Heart rate elevated but within acceptable parameters."

Sarah closed her eyes. She could picture him up there, his small dark fingers moving through the pre-flight checklist they'd practiced ten thousand times. Touch the oxygen gauge. Check. Touch the attitude indicator. Check. The custom restraints would be snug across his chest, designed to keep him secure during the violence of ascent. She'd watched them fit him for those straps. He'd signed *tight* and *okay* and given her that expression—the one that looked almost like a smile.

"Dr. Chen." Mission Director Kellerman's voice cut through her thoughts. "We need you at the communications station."

She turned from the window. Kellerman stood with his arms crossed, his face carved from the same granite as the blockhouse walls. Everything about him was hard angles and sharp edges—the crew cut, the jaw, the eyes that never quite met hers when they discussed the mission timeline.

"Of course." Sarah smoothed her skirt and crossed to the communications console, where a television monitor showed the capsule's interior camera. There he was. Bobby. His face filled the screen, dark eyes alert beneath the custom helmet. He was looking directly at the camera.

Directly at her.

She lifted her hands where he could see them through his own monitor, signing slowly: *Ready?*

His response came immediately, his fingers moving with the precision she'd drilled into him since he was small enough to cradle in her arms. *Ready. Go moon.*

Five years. Had it really been only five years since they'd brought him to her—a infant chimpanzee with eyes too intelligent for comfort, plucked from his mother at birth? She remembered the weight of him, the way his tiny fingers had gripped her thumb with surprising strength. The lab had smelled of disinfectant and desperation. The Cold War was eating through budgets and ethics alike, and the Soviets had already put a dog in orbit. A dog that died up there, though they hadn't admitted it for years.

"We need a win, Dr. Chen," her supervisor had said, placing Bobby in her arms. "We need it soon. Teach him everything."

*Everything.* But not *permanent.* Not *never.* Not *goodbye.*

"T-minus five minutes."

The room's energy shifted, tightening like a drawn breath. Sarah watched Bobby on the monitor as he continued his checks. His movements were calm, methodical. She'd trained him well. Perhaps too well. He trusted her completely, and she had used that trust to prepare him for a mission whose true parameters she could only guess at.

The rescue timeline had changed three times in the past month. First it was six months. Then a year. Last week, Kellerman had stopped mentioning it altogether.

"All stations, report status."

One by one, the stations called out: FIDO, GUIDO, CAPCOM, SURGEON. All green. All systems go. The machine was ready to hurl her friend into the void.

"Dr. Chen, we need confirmation of subject compliance."

*Subject.* Not Bobby. Never Bobby in the official reports.

She signed again: *Feel good?*

Bobby's response made her chest constrict. *Sarah proud?*

Her hands trembled as she formed the words: *Very proud.*

"T-minus one minute."

The room fell silent except for the countdown and the whisper of ventilation systems. Sarah's reflection stared back at her from the darkened monitor beside Bobby's feed—a woman in her thirties with dark hair pulled back too tight, eyes that hadn't slept properly in weeks. When had she started looking so haunted?

"Thirty seconds."

Bobby's hands moved again. *See you soon.*

Sarah's throat closed. She managed to sign: *See you soon.*

It was a lie. She knew it was a lie. But what else could she give him?

"Ten... nine... eight..."

The numbers fell like hammer blows. Sarah found herself back at the observation window, her palm pressed against the glass as if she could somehow reach through it, across the distance, and pull him back.

"Three... two... one..."

"Ignition."

The world turned white. Even through the reinforced glass, the light was blinding. Then the sound hit—not heard but *felt*, a physical force that rattled teeth and bones and the very foundations of the building. The Saturn V lifted, impossibly slow at first, then faster, riding a pillar of fire that turned night into day.

Sarah's hand slid down the glass, leaving a streak of condensation. She watched the rocket climb, accelerating, punching through a thin layer of clouds that scattered like frightened birds. In seconds it was just a bright point of light, a new star rising in the wrong direction.

"Separation confirmed. Second stage ignition successful."

Kellerman appeared at her shoulder. "Excellent work, Dr. Chen. Phase one complete."

She didn't look at him. Couldn't look at him. Her eyes stayed fixed on that distant point of light carrying Bobby away from everything he'd ever known, toward a destination where no rescue ship waited because—she was certain now—none was planned.

"You should celebrate," Kellerman said. "This is a historic moment."

"Yes," Sarah whispered. "Historic."

The light disappeared into the blue, leaving only empty sky and the fading thunder of engines. Somewhere up there, Bobby was experiencing weightlessness for the first time, seeing the curve of the Earth, alone with the stars and the lie she'd helped sell him.

*See you soon.*

The words echoed in her mind, hollow as the sky.

Behind her, someone popped a champagne cork.

**Scene 2: A flashback to three years ear...**

**Scene 2: A flashback to three years earlier**

The observation room smelled of disinfectant and stale coffee, a combination Sarah would forever associate with the beginning of everything. Through the one-way mirror, Bobby sat in the center of a white-tiled chamber, methodically stacking colored blocks into a tower that would inevitably fall. He was smaller then—barely four years old—his dark eyes sharp with concentration beneath a prominent brow.

Sarah pressed her palm against the glass, watching him work.

"He's arranged them by weight, not color," she said. "See? Heaviest at the bottom."

Dr. Marcus Webb didn't look up from his clipboard. The behavioral psychologist had the perpetually tired expression of a man who'd seen too many failed experiments. "Instinct. Structural stability. You're anthropomorphizing."

"Am I?" Sarah gathered her materials—flash cards, a stopwatch, a notebook already half-filled with observations Marcus had dismissed. "We'll see."

The chamber door hissed as she entered. Bobby's head snapped toward her, the tower forgotten. In three years, Sarah would recognize this exact expression—alert, curious, expectant—transmitted across 240,000 miles of void. But now, in this sterile room that tried so hard to look friendly with its primary-colored toys and cheerful murals, she simply smiled and sat cross-legged on the floor.

Bobby knuckle-walked closer, stopping just outside arm's reach. Cautious.

"Good morning," Sarah said, then brought her hand to her chin and moved it forward. *Good morning.* She repeated the gesture, slower.

Bobby tilted his head. Behind the mirror, she knew Marcus was watching, pen poised. They'd tried this with three other chimps. None had progressed beyond basic mimicry of food-related signs.

Sarah touched her chest. *Sarah.* She pointed at Bobby, then made a questioning gesture with her palms up.

For a long moment, nothing. Bobby's eyes tracked from her hands to her face and back again. Then, with a deliberateness that made Sarah's breath catch, he touched his own chest and looked at her expectantly.

"Bobby," she said, fighting to keep her voice steady. She made the sign—a 'B' hand-shape tapped twice against her chest.

Bobby's fingers fumbled through the approximation. His hands weren't built for the precision of ASL, but the intent was unmistakable. He touched his chest again, made the sign, then pointed at her with a questioning grunt.

Sarah's vision blurred. She blinked rapidly, professional enough not to cry in front of her subject, human enough that it was a near thing. She touched her chest and signed her name.

Bobby repeated it. *Sarah.*

Then he did something that would later fill three pages of her incident report and cause Marcus to request a full psychological evaluation—of Sarah, not Bobby. He picked up a red block, held it out to her, and very clearly signed: *What?*

The observation room intercom crackled. "Dr. Chen, please maintain protocol. You're not supposed to teach interrogatives until week six."

Sarah ignored it. She took the block, feeling its weight in her palm, and signed: *Red. Block.*

Bobby's hand shot out, grabbing a blue block. *What?*

*Blue. Block.*

A yellow one. *What?*

*Yellow. Block.*

Bobby dropped the yellow block and picked up the red one again. He held it close to his chest, then signed with his free hand: *Bobby. Red. Block.*

"Jesus Christ," Marcus's voice came through the intercom, stripped of its usual skepticism. "Is he... is he constructing sentences?"

Sarah couldn't answer. Bobby was already moving, gathering blocks, bringing them to her one by one. *What? What? What?* His signs grew more insistent, more excited. When she signed the colors, he'd repeat them, then immediately grab another block, another toy, pointing at the murals on the walls, at her watch, at the observation window.

*What? What? What?*

The world had just opened for him, and he wanted to know everything.

Two hours later, Sarah sat in Marcus's office, her hands trembling slightly as she accepted the coffee he offered. Through the window, she could see Bobby in his habitat, signing to himself as he examined a rubber ball.

"He's asking questions," Marcus said, still staring at his notes. "Not requesting. Not demanding. *Asking.*"

"Yes."

"In three years of primate language studies, we've never documented spontaneous interrogative formation." He set down his pen. "Dr. Chen, do you understand what this means?"

Sarah watched Bobby through the window. He'd noticed her and was signing: *Sarah. What?* He held up the ball.

She tapped on the glass, signed back: *Ball.*

Bobby nodded—actually nodded—and returned to his examination.

"It means," Sarah said quietly, "that we're not teaching him tricks. We're teaching him language."

"It means the mission is viable." Marcus's voice carried a weight that made Sarah turn from the window. "If he can learn to ask questions, he can learn to answer them. Report conditions. Describe malfunctions. He's not just a biological payload anymore, Sarah. He's a potential astronaut."

Something cold settled in Sarah's stomach. "He's four years old."

"He's a chimpanzee. They mature faster than humans." Marcus stood, gathering his files. "I'm recommending we accelerate the timeline. If he's this responsive now, imagine what he'll be capable of in two years. Three."

"Marcus—"

"This is what we've been working toward. What you've been working toward." He paused at the door. "Unless you're having second thoughts about the project?"

Through the window, Bobby had abandoned the ball. He was sitting with his back against the wall, signing to himself. Sarah recognized the gestures: *Sarah. Bobby. Good morning. Red. Blue. Yellow.* Practicing. Remembering.

"No," she heard herself say. "No second thoughts."

But as Marcus left and she returned to the observation room, watching Bobby sign his way through his new vocabulary with the joy of a child discovering words for the first time, Sarah felt the first hairline crack form in her certainty. 

Bobby looked up, saw her, and signed: *Sarah. More?*

She pressed her hand against the glass. *Tomorrow,* she signed. *More tomorrow.*

Bobby touched his palm to the glass opposite hers, matching her gesture. Then he made a sign she hadn't taught him, couldn't have taught him—a simple pressing of both hands to his chest, the universal gesture that transcended species.

He was trying to tell her something. Something that didn't have a sign yet.

Sarah would spend the next three years teaching him thousands of words. But she would never quite capture whatever it was Bobby had tried to express in that moment, with the inadequate vocabulary of a single afternoon and the infinite complexity of a mind just learning it had questions the world might not want to answer.

In the hallway outside, she could hear Marcus already on the phone with Washington, his voice bright with the possibility of success. Sarah stayed at the window until the facility lights dimmed for evening, watching Bobby arrange his blocks by color now, now that he had the words to distinguish them.

*What?* he signed to the empty air. *What? What? What?*

She would teach him so much. But there were some words—*permanent*, *never*, *alone*—that her superiors had already told her to avoid. Some questions that, even as she taught him to ask them, she knew she'd never be allowed to answer.

**Scene 3: Back in present-day mission co...**

**Scene 3: Back in present-day mission control**

The fluorescent lights in Mission Control hummed with a frequency that made Sarah's temples ache. She'd been awake for thirty-six hours, running final communication drills with Bobby, and now the classified briefing folder in her hands felt heavier than it should.

She flipped through the pages again, her finger tracing the rescue mission timeline. Launch plus eighteen months. She turned to the previous revision, dated three weeks earlier. Launch plus twenty-four months. Another page back. Launch plus thirty-six months.

The numbers were moving in the wrong direction.

Sarah's coffee had gone cold in its Styrofoam cup, a brown ring staining the rim where her lipstick had marked it hours ago. Around her, technicians moved with purpose between consoles, their voices a low murmur of systems checks and confirmations. The massive screens at the front of the room displayed trajectory calculations, fuel consumption rates, and Bobby's vital signs—transmitted from the medical bay where he waited in his pressure suit, probably wondering why she hadn't come to say goodbye.

She stood, the folder clutched against her chest, and made her way through the maze of workstations toward the glass-walled observation room where Director Kellerman stood with General Pritchard. Their silhouettes were backlit by the glow of the launch pad feeds, two men shaped by certainty she no longer felt.

Sarah knocked once and entered without waiting for permission.

Kellerman turned, his NASA administrator's smile already in place—the one he wore for press conferences and congressional committees. "Dr. Chen. Shouldn't you be at the communications console running final checks?"

"The timelines don't match." She set the folder on the conference table between them. "Every revision pushes the rescue mission further out. The original proposal said eighteen months. We're now at—"

"Projected estimates," General Pritchard interrupted. He was Air Force, not NASA, and his presence in Mission Control had always felt like an occupation. "The Soviets are unpredictable. We need flexibility in our planning."

"Flexibility?" Sarah opened the folder, her hands steadier than she felt. "Or are we just moving goalposts? Bobby keeps asking me when he comes home. I've been telling him eighteen months because that's what I was told to tell him."

Kellerman moved to the window, his reflection ghostly in the glass. Beyond, the Saturn V stood illuminated against the pre-dawn sky, a white monument to ambition or hubris—Sarah was no longer sure which.

"Dr. Chen," he said, his voice taking on the paternal tone she'd learned to distrust, "you're an excellent linguist and communications specialist. That's why you're here. But the broader strategic picture—"

"Don't." The word came out sharper than she intended. "Don't patronize me. I've spent every day for eight months with Bobby. Teaching him, talking to him. He trusts me."

"Which is why your role is so vital," Pritchard said. He picked up the folder and closed it with deliberate care. "The boy needs to believe in the mission. Morale is critical for operational success."

The boy. As if Bobby were just another piece of equipment, like the lunar module or the communications array.

Sarah felt something cold settle in her stomach. "You never intended to bring him back, did you?"

The silence that followed had weight. She could hear the ventilation system, the distant clatter of a dropped pen, someone laughing at a console two rooms away.

Kellerman finally turned to face her. His expression had shifted into something harder, more honest. "The Soviets are six months ahead of us. Maybe less. Every intelligence report confirms they're preparing their own manned lunar mission. If they get there first, if they establish permanent presence—" He shook his head. "We can't let that happen. The strategic implications—"

"Strategic implications," Sarah repeated. The words tasted like ash. "He's nine years old."

"He's a volunteer," Pritchard said.

"He's a *child*. He can't volunteer. He doesn't even have the vocabulary to understand what permanent means. I tried to teach him 'never' last month and your people told me to remove it from his lessons."

Kellerman's jaw tightened. "Dr. Chen, I need you to understand something. We are at war. Not a hot war, thank God, but a war nonetheless. And in war, we make sacrifices. Terrible sacrifices. The President himself has signed off on this mission. The Joint Chiefs. This is bigger than one boy, bigger than you or me or anyone in this building."

Sarah looked at the general, who met her gaze without flinching. His uniform was pristine, his ribbons a rainbow of conflicts she was too young to remember. He'd sent men to die before. This was just another calculation.

"What happens when he realizes?" she asked quietly. "When he figures out that the rescue mission isn't coming? When his food starts running low and he's alone up there with nothing but silence?"

"That's why you trained him so well," Kellerman said. "He'll have his mission. His purpose. He'll conduct experiments, send back data, establish American presence on lunar soil. He'll be a hero."

"He'll be terrified."

"He'll be remembered." Pritchard moved toward the door, his hand on the frame. "We all serve in our own way, Dr. Chen. Bobby's service happens to be up there. Yours is down here, making sure he can communicate, that he stays focused on his objectives. Can you do that?"

The question hung in the air like smoke. Through the window, the Saturn V's service structure had begun to retract, the final preparation before fueling. In a few hours, Bobby would be strapped into that capsule, riding a controlled explosion into the void.

And she would be the voice he trusted, guiding him there.

"I want it noted," Sarah said, her voice barely above a whisper, "that I object to this mission on ethical grounds."

"Noted," Kellerman said, though he made no move to write anything down. "Now, Dr. Chen, I need you at your station. We have a launch to execute."

Sarah picked up the folder, its pages full of lies and shifting timelines. Her reflection in the glass looked like a stranger—hair pulled back in a severe bun, dark circles under her eyes, NASA credentials hanging from her neck like a noose.

"One more thing," she said at the door. "When it ends—however it ends—I want you both to remember that you knew. That we all knew."

She didn't wait for a response. The control room seemed brighter when she returned, the screens more vivid, every sound sharp-edged and clear. Her console waited, the communication protocols she'd designed displayed across three monitors. In a few hours, she'd use them to talk to Bobby as he hurtled toward the moon.

As she sat down, she caught sight of the medical bay feed. Bobby was visible in profile, his small frame almost swallowed by the pressure suit. He was practicing signs to himself, his gloved fingers moving through the sequences she'd taught him.

*Ready. Strong. Home soon.*

Sarah closed her eyes and took a breath that hurt.

Then she put on her headset and began the pre-launch communications check, her voice steady and professional, betraying nothing of the woman who was screaming inside.

**Scene 4: A montage of flashbacks shows ...**

**Scene 4: A montage of flashbacks shows Bobby's training intensifying**

The centrifuge spun Bobby at four Gs, and Sarah watched through the observation window as his lips pulled back from his teeth in an involuntary grimace. His small hands gripped the armrests—not frantically, but with the steady pressure she'd taught him. Through the reinforced glass, she could see the training officer counting down with his fingers. Five. Four. Three.

Bobby's eyes found hers through two panes of glass and twenty feet of space. He raised one trembling hand and signed: *Fun.*

Sarah's laugh caught in her throat like a stone.

"Vitals are good," the technician beside her reported, his voice flat with routine. "Heart rate elevated but within parameters. He's doing better than Mitchell did on his first run."

Mitchell had been thirty-two years old and had vomited for an hour afterward.

The centrifuge whined down. When they opened the capsule, Bobby emerged with his distinctive rolling gait, one hand steadying himself against the metal frame. His fur was matted with sweat, but he moved directly to Sarah and signed: *Again?*

"Tomorrow," she signed back, then added the gesture for rest.

Bobby's expression—that peculiar chimpanzee blend of human emotion and something utterly other—shifted to something she'd learned to read as disappointment. He signed: *Bobby strong. Ready now.*

---

In the lunar module simulator, Bobby's fingers moved across the control panel with the precision of a concert pianist. Sarah stood behind the training supervisor, Commander Jack Reeves, a Korean War veteran with a face like weathered granite and eyes that gave away nothing.

"Pitch angle," Reeves said into the microphone.

Bobby's hand moved to the correct dial without hesitation.

"Throttle down thirty percent."

The adjustment came smooth and immediate.

"Fuel pressure warning."

Bobby's eyes scanned the panel. His fingers flew through a sequence: secondary valve, pressure check, compensate. The warning light died. He looked up at the observation window and signed: *Problem fixed.*

Reeves leaned back in his chair, arms crossed. "Run the abort scenario."

Sarah's hands tightened on the back of his chair. "Jack—"

"Abort scenario," he repeated, voice harder.

The simulator's lights went red. Alarms shrieked through the tiny space. Through the monitor, Sarah watched Bobby's face—no panic, no freezing. His hands moved through the emergency sequence they'd drilled into him over eight hundred repetitions. Master alarm. Abort stage. Engine cutoff. Ascent preparation.

Forty-five seconds. Textbook perfect.

When they let him out, Bobby's hands were shaking. Not from fear—from adrenaline. He signed to Sarah: *Bobby did good?*

"You did perfectly," she signed back, then pulled him into a hug before she could stop herself. His arms wrapped around her waist, his head pressed against her chest where he could hear her heartbeat. She felt him relax, the tension draining from his compact frame.

Over his head, she met Reeves's gaze. The commander's expression remained neutral, but something flickered there. Concern? Pity? He looked away first.

---

Late evening in the observation room. Most of the technicians had gone home. Sarah sat across from Bobby at the small table where they'd first met, a cup of coffee growing cold at her elbow. Bobby had a juice box—apple, his favorite—and was signing questions between sips.

*Why Bobby go alone?*

She'd prepared for this one. Had the answer ready. "You're the best," she signed. "The strongest. The smartest. You can do things other astronauts can't."

Bobby's head tilted, considering. Then: *When Sarah come?*

Her hands froze halfway to a response. Through the window behind Bobby, she could see the night janitor pushing his cart down the hallway, the squeak of wheels marking time she didn't have.

"Sarah stays here," she finally signed. "Sarah helps Bobby from Earth."

*After? When Bobby comes home?*

The fluorescent lights hummed. Somewhere in the building, a phone rang and rang and went unanswered.

"Yes," she signed, and hated herself for the lie she could feel in the word. "After."

Bobby brightened. He set down his juice box and signed rapidly: *Bobby comes home. Bobby tells Sarah about moon. About stars. About everything Bobby sees.*

"Yes," Sarah signed again, the repetition making it worse. "Tell me everything."

---

The vacuum chamber test. Bobby in the prototype suit, smaller than any NASA had built before, custom-fitted to his frame. The chamber door sealed with a hiss that reminded Sarah of a coffin closing. Through the porthole, she watched Bobby give the thumbs up—a human gesture he'd adopted with enthusiasm.

The pressure dropped. The suit inflated. Bobby moved through his checklist: joint mobility, glove dexterity, helmet seal verification. Each movement was slower in the suit, more deliberate. He picked up the sample collection tool, manipulated the bag, demonstrated the procedure they'd practiced a thousand times.

Fifteen minutes. Thirty. Forty-five.

The suit technician, a woman named Patricia who'd sewn every seam herself, bit her thumbnail. "He should be getting tired."

But Bobby continued, methodical and patient. An hour. Ninety minutes. Finally, the test supervisor called it. When they repressurized and opened the chamber, Bobby emerged drenched in sweat but steady. He looked at Sarah and signed: *How long?*

"Ninety-three minutes," she signed back.

Bobby's face split in what she'd learned to recognize as his version of a grin. He signed: *Longer than Armstrong training record.*

Sarah glanced at Patricia, who nodded confirmation. "By eighteen minutes," the technician said quietly.

That night, Sarah found Bobby in his habitat, sitting by the window that looked out over the Houston facility. The lights of the city sprawled beyond the fence line, a galaxy of human ambition and human failure.

She sat beside him. He leaned against her shoulder, warm and solid and real.

*Stars,* he signed, pointing up at the few visible through the light pollution.

"Yes," she signed. "Soon you'll see them all. More stars than you can count."

*Bobby scared,* he signed, so small she almost missed it.

Her throat constricted. "Scared is okay," she signed back. "Brave means scared but doing it anyway."

Bobby's hand found hers, his fingers curling around her palm. They sat like that for a long time, watching the distant lights, neither one signing the questions that mattered most.

When she finally stood to leave, Bobby signed one more thing: *Sarah proud of Bobby?*

She knelt down to his level, made sure he could see her face clearly in the dim light. "Sarah is so proud of Bobby," she signed, each gesture deliberate and true. "Always proud. Forever proud."

Bobby's arms wrapped around her neck. She held him, memorizing the weight of him, the warmth, the particular smell of the special shampoo they used on his fur.

In her pocket, the mission timeline crackled—she'd received the updated version that afternoon. The rescue window had shifted again. Moved back. And back. And back.

She held Bobby tighter and did not let herself cry until she was alone in her car in the parking lot, Houston spreading out below her like a circuit board, all those lights connecting to nothing, signifying nothing, burning bright and cold in the Texas night.

**Scene 5: The lunar module successfully ...**

**Scene 5: The lunar module successfully touches down in the Sea of Tranquility**

The altimeter counted down in Sarah's peripheral vision, numbers bleeding together through the sheen of tears she refused to let fall. Thirty feet. Twenty. Ten.

"Contact light," the CAPCOM announced, his voice steady despite the tremor in his hand as he gripped the console edge.

The thud of landing transmitted through the audio feed—a sound that traveled 238,900 miles to punch Sarah in the chest. Around her, mission control exploded. Men leaped from their chairs, cigar smoke blooming toward the ceiling tiles like celebratory gunfire. Someone's coffee mug shattered on the linoleum, the crash lost beneath the roar of triumph.

"We have touchdown! Tranquility Base has landed!"

Kellerman was already shaking hands with the brass, his smile broad and practiced, sweat stains spreading beneath his arms despite the air conditioning that kept the room at a constant sixty-eight degrees. Camera flashes popped from the observation gallery where the press pool had been corralled. Sarah could see their mouths moving, shouting questions that couldn't penetrate the bulletproof glass.

General Pritchard appeared at her station, champagne bottle already uncorked in his meaty fist. "Dr. Chen. Historic day. Historic." He filled a paper cup without asking, foam spilling over the rim onto her carefully organized flight notes.

She stared at the spreading wet circle, at the ink beginning to blur on her handwriting. *Positive reinforcement protocols. Post-landing stress indicators. Emergency sign vocabulary.*

"Thank you, General." The words came from somewhere outside herself.

On the main screen, Bobby's helmet camera feed flickered to life. The lunar module's interior was cramped, every surface covered in switches, dials, and the Velcro patches they'd added to help him orient himself. Through the triangular window, the Sea of Tranquility stretched away in shades of gray—charcoal, ash, slate, pearl. Shadows cut sharp as razors where craters interrupted the ancient plain.

Bobby's gloved hands entered the frame, moving with deliberate precision through the post-landing checklist. Sarah had drilled these procedures into him for six months until they became muscle memory, until he could perform them in his sleep. Now she watched him execute each step perfectly, his movements economical, professional.

His right hand rose into view, fingers forming the sign: *ENGINES OFF*.

"Confirming engine shutdown," the CAPCOM translated unnecessarily. Everyone who mattered already knew.

*FUEL STABLE*.

*SYSTEMS NOMINAL*.

*TEMPERATURE GOOD*.

Each sign crisp, textbook-perfect. Sarah's teaching reflected back at her from a quarter million miles away. Around her, the celebration intensified. Someone had found a radio, and "The Star-Spangled Banner" crackled through speakers meant for telemetry data. The champagne made its rounds—Kellerman's cup raised high, Pritchard's thick fingers wrapped around the bottle's neck.

Sarah's own cup sat untouched, bubbles rising and dying, rising and dying.

Bobby's hands continued their methodical dance. *OXYGEN GOOD*. *COMMUNICATIONS GOOD*. *READY FOR NEXT PHASE*.

"Beautiful," Kellerman breathed, appearing at Sarah's shoulder. His breath reeked of champagne and the cigar he'd been saving for this moment. "Look at him. Perfect. You trained him perfect, Sarah."

She wanted to claw his eyes out. Instead, she nodded, her throat too tight for words.

The camera feed showed Bobby settling back in his seat, the mission timeline calling for a rest period before the first EVA. Protocol dictated he should sleep, conserve energy, let his body adjust to one-sixth gravity. But Bobby's hands rose again, and Sarah's heart clenched.

*MISSION SUCCESS*, he signed, the gesture broad enough to be visible through the bulky suit.

Cheers erupted fresh. Pritchard clapped Kellerman on the back hard enough to make the mission director stumble. Flash bulbs strobed behind the observation glass.

Bobby's hands moved again. *GOOD LANDING*.

"Damn right it was!" someone shouted.

*BOBBY SAFE*.

The celebration noise seemed to recede, pulled away like a wave before a tsunami. Sarah leaned forward, her fingers white-knuckled on the console edge. She knew that pause, that slight tilt of Bobby's helmet as he considered his next sign. She'd seen it a thousand times in the training facility when he was working through a complex thought, trying to find the right combination of gestures to express what he felt.

His hands rose slowly, almost hesitantly. Then, with the same precision he'd shown throughout the landing sequence, Bobby signed two words that cut through the champagne haze like a scalpel through flesh:

*WHERE SARAH?*

The question hung in the air, transmitted through vacuum and atmosphere, bouncing off satellites and relay stations, traveling through cables and circuits to materialize in the sudden silence of mission control. The camera feed showed Bobby's hands frozen in position, waiting for an answer that would never come.

Someone's champagne cup hit the floor with a wet splat.

Kellerman's smile flickered, just for a moment, before reasserting itself with visible effort. "He's just disoriented. Perfectly normal post-landing confusion."

But Sarah saw Pritchard's expression harden, saw the general's eyes cut to her like a blade. She felt the weight of every person in mission control turning to look at her station, at the woman who had taught a chimpanzee to ask questions no one wanted to answer.

On the screen, Bobby's hands remained raised, still forming the sign. *WHERE SARAH?* The question repeated, more insistent now, his whole body leaning forward in the cramped module as if he could somehow see through the camera, through the miles and the void, to find her face among the celebrating strangers.

Sarah's hand moved to her microphone switch before she could stop herself. Kellerman's hand clamped down on her wrist, fingers digging in hard enough to bruise.

"Dr. Chen," he said quietly, his mouth still fixed in that terrible smile for the cameras above. "You're wanted in the director's office. Now."

The champagne had stopped flowing. The music played on, tinny and discordant, a soundtrack to the frozen tableau of mission control's triumph. Through it all, Bobby's hands stayed raised on the screen, asking and asking and asking into the silence, until finally—slowly, with what Sarah recognized as confusion, then hurt—they lowered out of frame.

The last thing she saw before Pritchard's security detail escorted her from the room was Bobby's helmet tilting down, the camera angle showing nothing but the gray dust of the Sea of Tranquility through the window, and the long shadow of the lunar module stretching across the loneliest landscape in human experience.

Behind her, someone started the applause again, forced and hollow, and the celebration stumbled back to life like a corpse jerked upright by strings.

**Scene 6: As the celebration continues around her...**

The champagne cork ricocheted off the acoustic tiles overhead. Someone grabbed Sarah's shoulders from behind—Henderson from Telemetry—shaking her in celebration she couldn't feel. The control room had erupted into controlled chaos, men in white shirts and thin ties embracing, lighting cigarettes with trembling hands, voices overlapping in a cacophony of relief and triumph.

"We did it! Christ almighty, we actually did it!"

Sarah kept her eyes on Monitor 4. The grainy black-and-white feed showed Bobby in the cramped lunar module, his helmet still on, gloved hands moving through the post-landing checklist. She'd watched him practice these exact movements five hundred times in the simulator. The muscle memory was perfect.

Kellerman was at the podium now, his voice booming over the intercom. "Ladies and gentlemen, at 20:17 UTC, the United States of America has successfully landed a manned vessel on the surface of the moon. All systems nominal. Pilot status—" he paused, glancing at Sarah, "—confirmed stable."

The room roared. Someone thrust a plastic cup of champagne into Sarah's hand. She took it, didn't drink.

On the monitor, Bobby had moved to the communications station. His hands came up, clearly visible now against the dark interior of the module. Sarah's breath caught. This was it—the final status report. The one she'd drilled into him until he could sign it in his sleep.

*Mission complete,* Bobby signed, his movements crisp despite the bulky gloves.

"Translation?" Kellerman called out, though he knew. They all knew.

"Mission complete," Sarah said, her voice steady.

*Systems good.*

"Systems good."

*Bobby safe.*

"Bobby safe."

The room was settling now, men returning to their stations, still grinning, still riding the high of the impossible made real. Sarah felt Henderson's hand slip from her shoulder. The champagne bubbles fizzed against the rim of her cup, tiny pops she could barely hear over the blood rushing in her ears.

Bobby's hands dropped. For a moment he was still, just a grainy figure in a bulky suit, sitting in a tin can a quarter million miles from home. Then he raised his hands again.

Sarah's cup hit the floor.

The movements were slow, deliberate. Not from the checklist. Bobby tilted his head, and even through the pixelated feed, even through the helmet's visor, Sarah could see him looking directly at the camera. Directly at her.

*Where Sarah?*

The question hung in the vacuum between worlds.

Sarah heard herself make a sound—small, broken. Her hand moved without thought, rising to sign back, though he couldn't see her, though Monitor 4 was receive-only, though the distance was too vast for anything but radio waves and lies.

"Dr. Chen?" Kellerman's voice had lost its triumph. "Translation?"

She couldn't speak. Her hand was still raised, frozen mid-sign.

On the monitor, Bobby waited. His hands remained in position, holding the question. In the module's harsh lighting, she could see the small stuffed dog she'd given him tucked into the webbing beside his seat. The one he'd named Laika.

The control room had gone quiet. Heads were turning. Someone coughed. The champagne smell was suddenly sickening, sweet and wrong.

"Dr. Chen." Kellerman again, harder now. "What did he say?"

Bobby signed it again, slower this time. *Where Sarah?*

Then his hands moved through a sequence she'd taught him in secret, during their last training session, when the guards had stepped out for coffee and she'd known—*known*—it was the last time.

*Sarah come soon?*

"Jesus," someone whispered.

Sarah's legs gave out. She caught herself on the edge of a console, metal biting into her palms. On the monitor, Bobby was still waiting, still looking at the camera with those dark eyes that trusted her, that had always trusted her, even when she'd taught him to climb into a rocket pointed at the sky.

*When Sarah come?*

Her voice came out as a whisper. "He's asking where I am."

"Tell him—" Kellerman started.

"Tell him what?" Sarah turned on him, and the room flinched at the raw edge in her voice. "Tell him what, exactly?"

Kellerman's jaw worked. Around them, the control room held its breath. On the wall, the mission clock ticked forward. On the monitor, Bobby's hands finally dropped. He looked down at the stuffed dog, then back at the camera.

One more sign. Simple. One she'd taught him the very first day.

*Alone.*

Then Bobby turned away from the camera, his shoulders small inside the suit, and began the sequence for powering down non-essential systems. Following the checklist. Being good. Being the perfect pilot they'd trained him to be.

Sarah watched him disappear into the routine, each movement precise and empty, and felt something fundamental crack inside her chest. The control room stayed silent. The champagne went flat in forgotten cups.

On the moon, in the Sea of Tranquility, Bobby worked alone.

And Sarah Chen, who had taught him the words for "safe" and "good" and "home" but never "permanent" or "never" or "I'm sorry," stood in mission control with nothing left to sign but the truth he would never see.

The celebration was over.
