## Chapter 1 Review: "Arnie's Urban Adventure"

### 1. Internal Consistency
- **Issue:** In Scene 4, the alley is described as being behind Mrs. Petrov's bakery, but in Scene 3, it's behind "Sweet Surrender" bakery.
- **Issue:** In Scene 3 Johnny is described as stumbling forward, scraping his knee, and being more upset about his book getting ruined. But he is not described as tending to or thinking about his knee later in the chapter.
- **Issue:** In Scene 5, Johnny slips the end of his worn-out shoelace through Arnie’s collar. But in Scene 6, Arnie is described as his head being down low, snout almost touching Johnny’s scuffed sneakers. This positioning is difficult to reconcile with the presence of a shoelace leash.

### 2. Clarity
- No issues found.

### 3. Plot Holes
- No issues found.

### 4. Redundancy
- No issues found.

### 5. Flow and Transitions
- **Issue:** Scene 2 ends with Johnny seeing a flash of pink, then Scene 3 jarringly starts with Johnny in an alley that reeks of burnt sugar. The transition doesn't clearly show Johnny's path from the "flash of pink" to the alley.

### 6. Actionable Fixes
1.  **Internal Consistency:** In Scene 4, change "Mrs. Petrov's bakery" to "Sweet Surrender bakery" to maintain consistency with Scene 3.
2.  **Internal Consistency:** In Scene 3, add a line or two about Johnny briefly tending to his scraped knee after his book gets ruined. This reinforces the injury and ensures it's not forgotten later in the chapter.
3.  **Internal Consistency:** In Scene 6, rewrite the beginning to reconcile Arnie's position with the shoelace leash. E.g., "The elevator doors pinged open on their floor. He glanced down at Arnie, who was tugging gently on the end of his worn-out shoelace leash, his head down low, snout almost touching Johnny’s scuffed sneakers."
4.  **Flow and Transitions:** In Scene 3, rewrite the beginning to more smoothly transition from Johnny seeing the "flash of pink" at the end of Scene 2. Add a sentence or two explaining why Johnny went into the alley. For example: "Drawn by the strange colour, Johnny hesitantly entered the alleyway behind Sweet Surrender bakery."
