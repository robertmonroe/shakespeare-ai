## Chapter 1: The Pig in the City

**Scene 1: Johnny sits in his small apart...**

Johnny sat in his small apartment late one afternoon, home from school. The window, smudged with old fingerprints, offered a distorted view of the city’s frenetic energy. Taxis blared, buses groaned, and a distant siren wailed. He rested his forehead against the glass, seeking a moment of cool stillness.

He released a sigh, swallowed by the city's clamor. "Old MacDonald's Farm," his cherished picture book, lay open in his lap. The farmer on the cover beamed beside a well-fed cow. Johnny traced the cow, the worn paper soft against his fingertip.

Inside, he'd marked his favorite scenes: fields of wheat, sheep dotting hillsides, a mother pig and her piglets. He paused at the pig picture, a familiar ache resonating within him. The piglets seemed so… connected, a poignant reminder of his own solitary existence.

He turned the page, the paper thin and brittle. A rooster, comb bright red, strutted across a barnyard. “Cocker-doodle-doo,” he murmured, imagining the sound echoing across open land, a world away from the city's rumble.

Closing the book, he held it close. The cramped apartment felt confining. He glanced out the window. A newspaper tumbled down the sidewalk, caught in the wind, a discarded thing. With a sigh that clouded the glass, Johnny decided to venture out. Perhaps a walk would alleviate the city's weight. He stood, grabbed his backpack, and headed for the door, sensing a shift in the day's ordinary routine. He carefully placed the book into his backpack before heading out.

**Scene 2: Johnny walks home from school,...** dodging a skateboarder weaving recklessly through the afternoon crowd. The air tasted like exhaust, a familiar but unpleasant flavor. He pulled his worn backpack tighter to his chest, a small comfort against the rough, grey world pressing in on him.

The sidewalk was a chaotic river of legs and shopping bags. A woman in bright pink leggings nearly clipped him with her oversized purse. "Watch it, kid!" she snapped, not even slowing down. Johnny mumbled an apology, even though it wasn't really his fault, and squeezed closer to the brick wall of a deli. The smell of salami, usually enticing, just felt heavy and overwhelming today.

He navigated around a cluster of pigeons pecking at a discarded pretzel, wrinkling his nose at the flapping wings and cooing noises. Even the city's birds seemed aggressive, constantly vying for scraps in a never-ending competition.

Then he saw it, plastered on a lamppost: a brightly coloured poster depicting a smiling clown juggling flaming torches. Beneath the clown, bold letters screamed: "The Great Alberto's Circus! Coming Soon!" Johnny stared at the image, a flicker of something he couldn't quite name sparking in his chest. Circuses were... exciting, weren't they? He'd only ever seen them on TV. But the noise, the crowds, the bright lights… It all felt a bit much, even just imagining it.

He sighed, the sound lost in the rumble of a passing bus. He readjusted his grip on his backpack and continued his walk, the poster fading from his mind. As he turned the corner onto Elm Street, a flash of pink – much brighter than the lady's leggings – caught his eye near a delivery truck. He paused, squinting, unsure of what he was seeing. The sheer absurdity of such a vibrant colour in this drab landscape was intriguing. He reasoned that, at the very least, it would be a welcome distraction from the monotony of his usual route home. Curiosity piqued, and a sense of adventure bubbling to the surface, Johnny decided to investigate the source of the unusual colour. Drawn by the unusual sight and the promise of something different, he turned down the alley to get a closer look. Little did he know, this detour would lead to an encounter that would change his day, and perhaps, his life.

**Scene 3: Johnny bumps into something la...**

The setting sun cast long shadows down Elm Street, momentarily darkening the entrance to the alley as Johnny approached. The air suddenly felt cooler, a stark contrast to the stuffy street. He hesitated for a moment, a prickle of unease raising the hairs on the back of his neck. He briefly wondered if he should just continue home, but the lure of the unknown, that splash of vibrant pink beckoning from the darkness, was too strong to resist. Taking a deep breath, he stepped into the alley.

The alley behind Sweet Surrender bakery reeked of burnt sugar and stale dough, a cloying sweetness that usually made Johnny’s stomach churn. Today, though, the smell was almost welcome; it masked the other, less pleasant odors of the city – the greasy exhaust fumes and the ever-present hint of something vaguely rotting. He shuffled through the narrow space, kicking a loose piece of crumbling brick, more lost in thought than paying attention to where he was going.

Suddenly, *thump*.

Johnny stumbled forward, his backpack slipping off his shoulder. He groaned, more upset about his scraped knee than the contents of his backpack spilling. "Great," he muttered, pushing himself up. "Just great." He scrambled to gather his belongings, making sure his picture book, "Old MacDonald's Farm," was still safe.

He turned to see what he'd bumped into. It was… large. And pink. And seemingly blocking the entire alley. At first, Johnny thought someone had dumped a particularly hideous, misshapen sofa. It was covered in a fine layer of alley dust, clinging to what looked like… wrinkles?

He cautiously circled the… *thing*. It was definitely soft, yielding slightly under his tentative poke. It smelled faintly of mud, a completely alien scent in this concrete jungle. He squinted, trying to make sense of the contours. There were… legs? Four of them? Short, stumpy legs. And a… tail?

Johnny’s breath caught in his throat. He leaned closer, his eyes widening. Now he could see it – the broad, flat snout, the small, almost hidden eyes blinking slowly, the ridiculously large ears that twitched with a lazy indifference.

"No way," he whispered, his voice barely audible above the rumble of a delivery truck passing on the street. He reached out a trembling hand and gently touched the dusty, pink skin. It was warm. Alive.

This wasn’t a discarded sofa. This was… a pig. A real, live, actual pig. Right here, in the alley behind Sweet Surrender bakery.

The pig grunted softly, a low rumble that vibrated through Johnny’s fingertips. It shifted its weight slightly, and Johnny, still mesmerized, took a step back. What was a pig doing here? In the city? In this *alley*?

He glanced around nervously. What if someone saw him? What if the owner came looking? He needed to… do something. But what? He looked at the pig, its eyes half-closed, seemingly content to continue its bizarre nap in the urban wilderness. An idea sparked in Johnny’s mind, crazy but wonderful.

He reached out again, this time not with fear, but with a strange, burgeoning sense of… hope. "Hey," he whispered to the pig. "Hey, buddy. You wanna come with me?" He didn't wait for an answer, already imagining the chaos, the impossible joy, that having a pig in his apartment might bring. He just knew, somehow, that this pig, this absurd and misplaced creature, was exactly what he needed.

He took another step closer, ready to lead this pink anomaly into the heart of his city life.

**Scene 4: Arnie, a pig with a penchant f...** for rhythmn**

The alley behind Sweet Surrender reeked of warm sugar and something vaguely burnt. Johnny held Arnie’s makeshift leash – a length of twine pilfered from his backpack – a little tighter. He noticed a faded tag clipped onto Arnie's ear, common on farm animals, and wondered where he had escaped from. The narrow space, usually deserted, felt claustrophobic with a pig the size of a small washing machine beside him. He was acutely aware of the rhythmic thumping emanating from Sweet Surrender's open back door, carrying with it a sugary-sweet scent that made his stomach rumble.

Suddenly, Arnie tensed. His ears perked up, swiveling like radar dishes towards the bakery door. His snuffling increased in volume, becoming a series of excited snorts. Arnie began pawing the ground with his front hooves, kicking up dust and small pebbles. He seemed restless, agitated by something Johnny couldn't quite place.

"Easy, Arnie," Johnny murmured, tugging gently on the twine. "What's got you so worked up?"

He listened more closely to the rhythmic thumping. It wasn't just general noise from the bakery; there was a distinct beat, a pulse that seemed to vibrate through the very ground beneath their feet. It was a catchy pop tune, the same one Johnny sometimes heard blaring from passing cars.

Arnie took a few tentative steps toward the bakery door, pulling against the twine. He let out a series of short, insistent grunts, his gaze fixed on the source of the sound. He shuffled his weight from one foot to the other.

"You smell something good in there, huh?" Johnny asked, surprised. He hadn't considered Arnie might be drawn to the source of the baking smells, the sweet scent intensifying his hunger.

He decided to test a theory. Johnny started to mimic eating, exaggerated chewing motions, pointing towards the bakery. Arnie's ears twitched, and his snorting became more rhythmic, almost mirroring Johnny's chewing. He took another step, then another, his hooves clicking against the pavement.

"Huh," Johnny said, a slow smile spreading across his face. "I think you're hungry, buddy."

Johnny stopped chewing, and Arnie immediately stilled, his gaze questioning. He let out a soft, disappointed grunt.

"Okay, okay," Johnny chuckled. "Just testing. But we can't stay here all day. Someone might see us." He tugged gently on the twine. "Come on, Arnie. Let's find a place where you can enjoy the… whatever they're baking… without getting caught."

**Scene 5: Johnny decides to lead Arnie b...**

Johnny bit his lip, glancing around. The lunchtime crowd was starting to thin, but he still needed a plan. "We gotta get you… somewhere safe. Away from all this noise."

Arnie, oblivious to Johnny's internal turmoil, let out a contented grunt and nudged Johnny’s leg with his snout.

“No, no eating trash!” Johnny pulled the wrapper away. “Bad pig! Come on.” He slipped the end of his worn-out shoelace through Arnie's ear tag. It wasn’t ideal, but it was the best he could do.

Arnie, naturally, did not.

Johnny tugged gently. “Walk. Heel. Sort of.” Arnie responded by digging his hooves into the cracked sidewalk, stubbornly resisting.

"Ugh." Johnny crouched down. "Look, if you don't come with me, you'll get caught. Someone will call Animal Control, and they'll take you back to… I don’t know where. Maybe… maybe you were part of some… art installation? Yeah! Some kind of… performance art. But it ended, and they just left you here. Or… or maybe you escaped from Evergreen Farms. That’s gotta be it. You were headed to market, but you took a wrong turn. A *very* wrong turn."

Seeing Arnie’s ears twitch but otherwise remaining impassive, Johnny pressed on, deciding to play on the pig's possible desires instead. "I know a place… it's got soft things to lie on, maybe even some leftover scraps nobody will mind you eating." He painted a tempting picture. "But we have to be quick, and quiet. Can you do that, Arnie?"

Arnie seemed to consider this, snuffling thoughtfully. Then, he took a tentative step forward, then another. The shoelace leash was taut. Johnny stood up, relief washing over him. It wasn’t a guarantee, but it was enough.

The journey began as a series of jerky starts and stops. Arnie was fascinated by everything – fire hydrants, discarded newspapers, even the grates over subway entrances. Each new attraction threatened to bring their progress to a screeching halt.

Johnny, acutely aware of the stares they were attracting, tried to keep Arnie moving. "Come on, boy! Good boy!" He pulled Arnie close as they navigated a busy crosswalk, the blare of horns and the screech of tires adding to his anxiety. He could feel the hot exhaust fumes sting his nostrils and taste the gritty city air on his tongue.

A woman with a brightly colored scarf gasped, pointing at Arnie. "Is that... a pig? What's a pig doing in the city?"

Johnny's cheeks burned. He shrugged, feigning nonchalance. "I dunno," he said, trying to sound casual. "Maybe it escaped from somewhere. I'm just... helping him find his way." He tugged Arnie forward, hoping she wouldn't press the issue. The woman looked at him skeptically. "Helping him? You're going to get in trouble, you know. That thing probably isn't even allowed in the city."

They squeezed past a group of teenagers laughing and talking loudly, the boom of their music making Arnie squeal in alarm. Johnny patted Arnie's flank reassuringly. "It's okay, buddy. Just a little further." One of the teens gave them a weird look and muttered something to his friends, who snickered.

Finally, they reached the entrance to Johnny's apartment building, a grimy brick structure that smelled faintly of stale garbage and cooking oil. He glanced nervously at the doorman, a burly man named Tony who always seemed to be scowling. Luckily, Tony was engrossed in a crossword puzzle.

“Okay, Arnie, quiet now,” Johnny hissed, pushing open the heavy glass door. “Operation: Pig-in-Apartment is a go.”

**Scene 6: Johnny manages to sneak Arnie ...**

Johnny took a quick glance at Tony, who was still concentrating on his puzzle, oblivious to the pig that had just entered the building. Heart pounding, Johnny ushered Arnie towards the elevators, thankful that none of the other residents were around. He jabbed the call button repeatedly, impatience gnawing at him with each passing second. When the doors finally slid open with a *ding*, Johnny breathed a sigh of relief and led Arnie inside.

Johnny held his breath as the elevator doors pinged open on their floor. He glanced down at Arnie, who was surprisingly cooperative, his head low. Johnny prayed no one would come out of their apartment.

“Okay, Arnie, quiet as a… as a mouse,” he whispered, pushing the door open slowly. He peeked inside. Empty. Relief loosened the tension in his shoulders.

He ushered Arnie inside, the pig's hooves clicking softly on the linoleum floor. The apartment smelled faintly of his mom’s lavender laundry detergent and something metallic, probably leftover from last night’s dinner.

“Phew,” Johnny breathed, closing the door. Arnie gave a soft oink and nuzzled Johnny’s hand. “Okay, okay, you’re safe now. Almost.”

He gently guided Arnie through the living room, maneuvering him around the worn sofa and his dad's newspaper. Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating dust particles. It looked peaceful, considering the porcine guest.

Johnny’s bedroom door was ajar. He pushed it open wider. It was his sanctuary, a cluttered space filled with comic books, Lego creations, and grape bubblegum. Perfect for hiding a pig, he thought.

"Alright, Arnie, welcome to your… temporary home,” Johnny announced. Arnie sniffed at the rug, then ambled over to Johnny’s beanbag chair, nudging it.

Johnny rummaged in his backpack and pulled out the cheese crackers and apple slices he’d salvaged from his lunchbox, placing them in a bowl he usually used for Lego pieces. Arnie, eyes gleaming, wasted no time in attacking the offering. Cracker crumbs flew, and the apple slices disappeared quickly.

"Easy there, champ," Johnny chuckled, watching Arnie devour the food. He felt a warmth spread through him, a sensation he hadn’t realized he was missing. He wasn't alone. He had a friend.

He settled onto his bed, watching Arnie munch contentedly. The afternoon sun warmed his face. For the first time in a long time, Johnny felt a flicker of genuine happiness. He reached out and scratched Arnie behind the ears. The pig let out a satisfied grunt and leaned into his touch.

But the peace was fragile. Every creak of the building, every distant siren, made Johnny jump. What if his parents came home early? What would he say? He imagined his mom's horrified expression, his dad's booming voice. A knot tightened in his stomach.

He glanced at the clock on his bedside table. 3:30 PM. That gave him… two and a half hours before dinner, at least.

He took a deep breath. He would enjoy these next few hours. He would make them count. He looked at Arnie, happily munching on the last of the apple slices. He was curious to see how Arnie would react, grabbing his favorite pop song CD and headed for the old boombox in the corner.

"Okay, Arnie," Johnny said, a mischievous glint in his eye.
