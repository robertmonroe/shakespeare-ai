Okay, here's my review of Chapter 2 of "Hog Wild: A Graceland Pig Tale," based on the criteria you provided.

1.  **Internal Consistency**

*   No issues found.

2.  **Clarity**

*   No issues found.

3.  **Plot Holes**

*   No issues found.

4.  **Redundancy**

*   No issues found.

5.  **Flow and Transitions**

*   Issue: Scene 2, the transition to Beale Street is weak. The description implies Percy has traveled some distance, but this is not explicitly stated, and it is not clearly explained how he finds Beale Street from the highway.
*   Issue: Scene 4, transitioning from encountering Daisy to arriving at their camp. It is abrupt. A sentence or two setting the scene of how they arrive, or how far the camp is could add to the continuity.

6.  **Actionable Fixes**

1.  In Scene 2, add a sentence or two after Percy leaves the highway ramp about his process for deciding to head to Beale Street. (e.g., "Remembering the billboards advertising Beale Street, Percy decided to follow signs pointing towards the city center, hoping the music would lead the way.").
2.  In Scene 4, add a brief transition after Daisy pulls Percy away from the fruit vendor. For example: ("Daisy, still holding his hoof, led him through a maze of alleyways, the sounds of Beale Street fading behind them until they reached a quieter, more desolate area.").
