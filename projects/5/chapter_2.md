## Chapter 2: First Contact

**Scene 1: Max arrives at the Kunsthistor...**

**Scene 1: Max arrives at the Kunsthistorisches Museum**

The afternoon light slanted through the tall windows of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, turning the marble floors to honey. Max Monroe stood in the Maria Theresien-Platz entrance, watching invitation-holders trickle past the velvet ropes into the private exhibition. His charcoal suit was Savile Row, his shoes Italian leather, his watch a vintage Patek Philippe—every detail calibrated to suggest old money and refined taste.

Michael Brennan. American. Boston family. Yale Art History. Specializing in Imperial Russian decorative arts.

He'd been Michael Brennan for three weeks now, building the legend through carefully placed phone calls, a few strategic appearances at Christie's Vienna, and a rented apartment in the First District with the right address. The cover sat on him like a well-tailored coat.

Max presented his invitation—acquired through a contact at Sotheby's—and moved into the exhibition hall. The space was intimate, perhaps fifty guests maximum, their murmured conversations echoing off the vaulted ceilings. Champagne flutes caught the light. The air smelled of expensive perfume and old wood polish.

He'd walked this room twice before during public hours, memorizing sight lines and conversation zones. Now he moved with practiced ease toward the Fabergé collection, positioned in an alcove beneath a painting of Catherine the Great. The centerpiece was the Winter Egg, its surface of carved rock crystal and platinum catching light like frozen water.

Perfect.

Max positioned himself at a forty-five-degree angle to the display case, close enough to seem engaged but not so close as to appear territorial. From here, he could see both entrances. His hand rested casually in his pocket, fingers brushing the business cards embossed with Michael Brennan's details.

A waiter passed with champagne. Max took a glass he wouldn't drink.

He checked his watch—a gesture, nothing more. Elena Volkov would arrive between four-fifteen and four-thirty. She never missed Russian imperial exhibitions, and she was always fashionably late. The Agency's surveillance had been thorough.

Two women in their sixties examined a jeweled cigarette case nearby, speaking German. A young couple photographed a miniature portrait. Max studied the Winter Egg, letting his eyes trace the delicate platinum branches etched across its surface, the tiny diamonds representing frost. He'd memorized every detail, every date, every provenance note. Michael Brennan would know these things.

The muscles between his shoulder blades held a familiar tension. First contact was always a tightrope—too eager and you spooked them, too aloof and you lost the opportunity. Everything depended on reading the moment, on instinct honed through a dozen operations across a dozen cities.

But Elena Volkov wasn't a target in the usual sense. She was an access point. A door that needed opening.

Max adjusted his cufflink and waited, his reflection ghosting across the glass case. Behind him, the gallery filled with the soft percussion of footsteps and cultured voices. The light shifted as clouds moved outside.

Four-seventeen.

The main entrance drew his peripheral attention—a small group entering, led by a museum curator in an immaculate suit. And there, just behind him, a woman in a navy dress that whispered money and Moscow in equal measure.

Elena Volkov.

Max didn't turn. Not yet. He let her move into the space, let her orient herself, let the moment breathe. His heart rate stayed steady, his breathing unchanged. This was just another operation.

He took a small step closer to the Winter Egg, tilting his head as if noticing something new, and waited for the world to shift into motion.

**Scene 2: Elena enters the gallery, and ...**

**Scene 2: Elena enters the gallery, and Max observes her from a distance**

The Fabergé exhibition room hummed with the murmur of Vienna's elite, their voices echoing softly against marble floors and vaulted ceilings. Max stood before a display case containing the Azure Serpent Clock, pretending to study its coiled mechanism while his peripheral vision tracked the entrance.

She arrived at precisely 7:47 PM.

Elena Volkov moved through the arched doorway like a woman accustomed to being watched but indifferent to it. Her black cocktail dress was understated—Dior, Max guessed, maybe Saint Laurent—the kind of expensive simplicity that whispered rather than shouted. Dark hair swept up in a classic chignon. Pearls at her throat. She paused just inside the threshold, her gaze sweeping the room with the practiced efficiency of someone cataloging exits and faces in a single glance.

*FSB training*, Max thought. *Or just the instincts of a woman who's learned to be careful.*

He watched her decline a glass of champagne from a passing waiter with a polite shake of her head. No alcohol. Maintaining control. She moved deeper into the gallery, her heels clicking a measured rhythm against the floor, stopping before a display of miniature Easter eggs. The way she tilted her head, the slight softening of her shoulders—there was something almost wistful in her posture.

Max counted to thirty, then began his approach.

He drifted past two other displays, timing his steps so that he would arrive at the Imperial Coronation Egg precisely fifteen seconds before she did. The egg sat in solitary splendor beneath focused lighting, its gold surface gleaming, the double-headed eagles rendered in exquisite detail. He positioned himself at the optimal angle—close enough to seem absorbed in the piece, far enough to allow her space.

Her reflection appeared in the glass case beside his.

They stood in silence for a moment, two strangers admiring the same object. Max could smell her perfume now—something subtle, expensive. Not the heavy Russian scents popular in Moscow, but something French. Chanel, perhaps.

"Remarkable, isn't it?" Max said, his American accent carefully neutral—educated East Coast with hints of time spent abroad. "The precision of the enamelwork. Wigström was Fabergé's head workmaster when this was created. You can see his signature attention to detail in the gradation of the yellow enamel."

Elena turned slightly, her dark eyes assessing him with the kind of quick intelligence that made Max's pulse quicken—not from nerves, but from the recognition of a worthy opponent.

"You know your Fabergé, Mr...?" Her English was flawless, touched with a British accent that suggested expensive schools.

"Brennan. Michael Brennan." He extended his hand. "Guilty as charged. Occupational hazard, I'm afraid. I deal in European decorative arts."

Her handshake was firm, brief. "Elena Volkov."

"A pleasure." Max returned his gaze to the egg, giving her space to decide whether to continue the conversation. "Though I have to admit, I'm partial to the lesser-known pieces. Everyone knows the Coronation Egg, but have you seen the Lilies of the Valley Egg? It's in the far corner. The pearls that form the lily petals—"

"Are each hand-selected for uniform size and luster," Elena finished, the ghost of a smile touching her lips. "And the miniature portraits of Nicholas II and his daughters are concealed behind the central flower. I've seen photographs, but never the actual piece."

Max smiled, genuinely pleased. "You're not just another champagne-sipping socialite, are you, Mrs. Volkov?"

"Ms. Volkov," she corrected, though without edge. "And no. My grandfather was a curator at the Hermitage. I grew up surrounded by these pieces. Or at least, the ones that survived."

There it was—that note of sadness he'd read about in her file. The weight of history, of things lost. Max filed it away.

"Then you must let me bore you with my amateur observations," he said, gesturing toward the Lilies of the Valley Egg across the room. "Unless you're waiting for someone?"

Elena glanced at the thin gold watch on her wrist—Cartier, Max noted—then back at him. For a moment, he thought she might decline. Her expression was carefully neutral, the mask of a diplomat's wife firmly in place.

But then something shifted in her eyes. A decision made.

"I'm not waiting for anyone," she said quietly. "And I doubt very much that you could bore me, Mr. Brennan."

They moved together through the gallery, their footsteps falling into an easy rhythm. The crowd parted around them, and Max was acutely aware of the space between them—close enough for conversation, distant enough to remain proper. Professional.

*Just another operation*, he reminded himself.

But as they stopped before the Lilies of the Valley Egg and Elena leaned forward to examine the delicate pearls, her face illuminated by the display lights, Max felt something he hadn't anticipated.

Interest. Real, unscripted interest.

He pushed the thought aside and launched into his prepared observations about the egg's provenance, his voice warm and engaging, every word calculated to draw her deeper into conversation.

Elena listened, asked intelligent questions, and when she laughed at his story about a disastrous auction in Geneva, the sound was genuine and unguarded.

The operation was proceeding exactly as planned.

So why did that make him uneasy?

**Scene 3: Their conversation about the F...**

**Scene 3: Their conversation about the Fabergé egg evolves into a deeper discussion**

The gilded halls of the Kunsthistorisches Museum seemed to contract around them as they moved from the Fabergé display into the adjoining gallery. Max found himself genuinely engaged, a dangerous development he noted with professional detachment even as he leaned closer to hear Elena's observations.

"You see how Fabergé used guilloché here?" She gestured toward a smaller egg in a corner case, her gloved hand hovering near the glass. "The wave pattern beneath the translucent enamel. It's meant to evoke water, memory—things that slip through your fingers."

Max studied her profile in the warm museum lighting. She wore her dark hair swept back in a simple chignon, and her burgundy dress was elegant without being ostentatious. Everything about her presentation was controlled, refined. But there was something in the way she looked at the egg—a hunger, or perhaps a loss.

"You speak as if you've seen these before," he said. "Outside of museums."

A smile flickered across her lips. "My grandmother had a collection. Nothing so grand as these, of course. Smaller pieces. A cigarette case. A frame with the Romanov crest." She paused, and the smile faded. "All gone now. Sold when we left."

"Left Russia?"

"St. Petersburg. I was twelve." She moved to the next case without waiting for him, her heels clicking softly on the marble floor. "Do you know what it's like, Mr. Brennan, to have your entire world reduced to two suitcases?"

Max followed, maintaining the careful distance of a new acquaintance while his mind catalogued every detail. The slight tension in her shoulders. The way she touched her wedding ring—not nervously, but absently, as if checking it was still there. The refined Moscow accent beneath her German.

"I can't imagine," he said truthfully. "Though I suppose we all carry invisible suitcases. Things we can't bear to leave behind, even when we should."

She turned to him then, and her eyes—gray-green in this light—held his for a moment longer than politeness required. "That's rather philosophical for an art dealer."

"Art dealers traffic in memory," Max replied, warming to the role. "Every piece we sell is someone's past being packed away. You learn to recognize the weight of it."

They had entered a gallery of imperial portraits now, massive canvases depicting Catherine the Great, Alexander II, Nicholas and Alexandra in their doomed splendor. A handful of other visitors drifted through the space, but Elena seemed oblivious to them. She stopped before a portrait of the last Tsarina, her expression unreadable.

"My grandmother used to say that beauty without purpose is just decoration," Elena said quietly. "She meant the court, the excess. All of it." She gestured at the painting. "And yet, look at the brushwork. The way Serov captured the sadness in her eyes. Even in 1900, before everything fell apart, he saw it. The ending that was coming."

Max moved beside her, close enough now to catch the subtle scent of her perfume—something with jasmine and bergamot. "Do you miss it? Russia?"

"Every day." The admission seemed to surprise her. She glanced at him, then away. "Which is absurd, isn't it? I have a good life here. Vienna is beautiful. My husband is... successful. We have everything we could need."

The pause before "successful" lasted only a heartbeat, but Max caught it. Filed it away.

"And yet?" he prompted gently.

Elena laughed, but there was no humor in it. "And yet I spend my afternoons talking to strangers in museums about Fabergé eggs and lost grandmothers. You must think me terribly melancholy, Mr. Brennan."

"I think you're honest," Max said. "It's refreshing."

They walked in silence through two more galleries. Max let the quiet settle between them, a technique he'd learned years ago—people filled silence with truth more readily than they answered questions. Elena paused occasionally before a painting or artifact, but her earlier enthusiasm had dimmed. She seemed suddenly aware of herself, of how much she'd revealed.

At a display of illuminated manuscripts, she finally spoke again. "Do you really visit Café Central regularly?"

"Most afternoons," Max lied smoothly. "The coffee is terrible, but the atmosphere makes up for it."

"I used to go there," she said. "Years ago, when I first came to Vienna. Before..." She trailed off, touching her ring again. "I always thought I'd go back, but somehow I never do."

"You should," Max said. "They still have the same terrible coffee."

This time her laugh was genuine, and it transformed her face. For a moment, the careful mask slipped, and Max saw the woman beneath—younger than her polished exterior suggested, perhaps lonely, certainly isolated in ways that had nothing to do with geography.

"Perhaps I will," she said.

They had circled back to the exhibition's entrance. Through the tall windows, Max could see dusk settling over Vienna, the buildings taking on that particular golden quality of late afternoon. Other visitors were beginning to drift toward the exits.

Elena checked a delicate watch on her wrist. "I should go. My driver will be waiting."

"Of course." Max extended his hand. "It was a pleasure, Mrs. Volkov. Truly."

She took his hand, her grip surprisingly firm. "Elena, please. And yes, it was." She hesitated, and Max recognized the moment—the decision point, the instant when a target either committed or withdrew. "The opera season opens next week. Die Fledermaus. Do you attend?"

"I have tickets for Friday's performance," Max said. Another lie, though he'd acquire them within the hour.

"We have a box," Elena said. "Fifth tier, center. Perhaps I'll see you there."

"Perhaps you will."

She held his gaze a moment longer, then released his hand and turned toward the exit. Max watched her go, noting the straightness of her spine, the controlled elegance of her movements. At the doorway, she glanced back once, and something in that look—vulnerable, hopeful, already regretting her openness—made his chest tighten.

He waited until she disappeared before pulling out his phone. The message to his handler was brief: *First contact successful. Subject responsive. Proceeding to phase two.*

But as he walked out into the cooling Vienna evening, Max couldn't shake the memory of her voice saying *Do you know what it's like to have your entire world reduced to two suitcases?* 

He did know. He'd done it to people. Helped orchestrate the reduction of entire lives into rubble and ash.

He reminded himself that this was different. This was necessary.

The lie felt thinner than usual.

**Scene 4: As they view a painting of the...**

**Scene 4: As they view a painting of the Russian countryside**

The painting dominated the north wall of the gallery—a vast canvas depicting the endless steppes of southern Russia at twilight. Pale gold light stretched across snow-dusted fields toward a horizon that seemed to exist beyond the frame itself. A single birch tree stood sentinel in the foreground, its white bark luminous against the gathering dusk.

Elena stopped walking.

Max watched her profile as she studied the landscape, noting how her breathing had changed, becoming slower, deeper. The museum's climate control hummed softly overhead, maintaining the precise temperature required for preserving centuries-old pigments. Somewhere in an adjacent gallery, footsteps echoed and faded.

"Levitan," she said quietly. "Isaac Levitan. 1895."

"You know it?"

"I know the feeling." Her gloved hand rose slightly, as if she might touch the canvas, then fell back to her side. "That particular quality of light. The way the snow catches the last sun before night comes. You can almost feel the cold."

Max moved closer to the painting, maintaining the careful distance he'd established—near enough to be companionable, far enough to remain unthreatening. The oil paint had been applied in thin layers, building depth through transparency. He could see why the artist had been celebrated.

"It's beautiful," he offered.

"It's lonely." Elena's voice had changed, losing some of its polished veneer. "All that space. All that silence. When I was a girl, my grandmother had a dacha outside Moscow. In winter, the fields looked exactly like this. Endless. Empty."

She blinked, and the moment passed. The mask slipped back into place—the composed diplomat's wife, the elegant expatriate. But Max had seen beneath it, and he knew she was aware he'd seen.

"I'm sorry," she said, managing a small smile. "I don't usually become maudlin in museums."

"Don't apologize. That's what art is supposed to do, isn't it? Make us feel something real."

Elena turned from the painting, her heels clicking softly on the polished floor as she moved toward the next gallery. Max fell into step beside her, letting a beat of silence establish itself before speaking again.

"You know, if you enjoy this kind of thing, you should try the Staatsoper sometime. They're doing *Eugene Onegin* next month." He kept his tone casual, conversational. "Tchaikovsky's Russia might be more dramatic than Levitan's, but there's the same kind of... melancholy underneath."

"You like opera?" There was genuine interest in her voice.

"When I can. It's one of the reasons I love Vienna—you can actually afford to go regularly without mortgaging your future." He smiled. "Back in New York, decent seats cost what I'd normally spend on groceries for a month."

"And do you go alone?"

The question hung between them, delicate as the Fabergé egg they'd discussed earlier. Max recognized it for what it was—an inquiry about his availability, his attachments, his accessibility.

"Usually," he said. "I find I notice more when I'm not trying to share the experience. Selfish, maybe, but honest."

They passed through an archway into a smaller gallery, this one displaying Orthodox icons. Gold leaf caught the carefully positioned lighting, creating halos within halos.

"I haven't been to the opera since we arrived in Vienna," Elena said. "Dmitri finds it boring. He prefers..." She paused, seeming to choose her words carefully. "More modern entertainment."

"His loss." Max stopped before an icon of Saint Nicholas, studying the severe Byzantine features. "Though I suppose opera isn't for everyone. I'm probably too much of a romantic. I even have a regular table at Café Central—same time every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon. Read the paper, watch the world go by. Terribly predictable."

"That doesn't sound predictable. It sounds civilized."

"In this city, maybe they're the same thing." He glanced at his watch—a calculated gesture, suggesting time constraints, preventing the conversation from extending too long. "I should probably let you get back to the exhibition. I've monopolized enough of your afternoon."

"You haven't monopolized anything." Elena's hand touched his arm briefly, a fleeting contact through the layers of fabric. "This has been the most pleasant conversation I've had in weeks. Thank you, Mr. Brennan."

"Michael, please. And the pleasure was entirely mine."

They exchanged the polite formalities of parting—the subtle dance of two people acknowledging mutual interest while maintaining plausible deniability. As Max walked toward the museum's exit, he resisted the urge to look back. He knew Elena was watching him leave.

Outside, the afternoon had turned colder. Clouds had moved in from the west, threatening snow. Max turned up his collar and descended the museum steps, mentally reviewing the encounter, cataloging every word, every gesture, every micro-expression.

He'd planted the seeds. Staatsoper. Café Central. Tuesday and Thursday afternoons.

Now he just had to wait for them to grow.

But as he walked through the darkening streets toward his safe house, Max couldn't quite shake the image of Elena's face as she'd studied that painting—the loneliness in her eyes, the longing for something she'd lost or never had. It had been real. Unguarded. Human.

He told himself it didn't matter. Told himself he'd seen it because he'd been trained to look for exactly those kinds of vulnerabilities.

He almost believed it.

**Scene 5: Viktor Volkov's security detai...**

**Scene 5: Viktor Volkov's security detail appears**

The change in Elena was instantaneous.

Max saw it happen—the way her shoulders stiffened mid-sentence, her gaze cutting past him toward the gallery entrance. The animated warmth that had colored her face for the past forty minutes drained away, replaced by something carefully neutral.

He followed her line of sight and spotted them immediately: two men in dark suits, their builds suggesting hours in the gym rather than museums. They stood just inside the doorway, hands clasped in front of them, scanning the room with the methodical precision of trained security personnel. The taller one spoke quietly into his sleeve.

"I'm afraid I need to go," Elena said, her voice suddenly formal, distant.

The transformation was remarkable. The woman who moments ago had been laughing at his story about a disastrous auction in Prague—leaning close, eyes bright with genuine amusement—had vanished. In her place stood the diplomat's wife, poised and impenetrable.

"Of course," Max said smoothly, though he let a hint of disappointment color his tone. "I've monopolized far too much of your time already."

"No, you haven't." The words came quickly, almost urgently, before she caught herself. Her fingers tightened around the small clutch she carried. "I mean—the conversation has been lovely. Truly."

The taller security man was moving toward them now, weaving between clusters of well-dressed patrons admiring Catherine the Great's jeweled snuffboxes. His eyes never left Elena.

She noticed too. Max watched her take a small breath, squaring her shoulders as if preparing for something unpleasant. The gesture was so subtle he might have missed it if he hadn't been trained to read such tells.

"Mrs. Volkov," the security man said in Russian-accented English. "The car is ready."

"Thank you, Dmitri. I'll be just a moment."

The man didn't move. He stood there, solid as a monument, his presence a clear message: *time's up*.

Elena turned back to Max, and for just a second, her mask slipped. He saw it again—that sadness he'd glimpsed earlier, deeper now, tinged with something that looked like resignation.

"It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Brennan." She extended her hand.

Max took it, noting the coolness of her skin, the way her grip was firm but brief. Professional. "The pleasure was entirely mine. Perhaps we'll run into each other again. Vienna is a small city in some ways."

"Perhaps." She hesitated, and Max recognized the war playing out behind her eyes. Want versus obligation. Freedom versus control. "You mentioned you frequent Café Central?"

"Almost daily. I find the atmosphere conducive to contemplation." He smiled. "And the apple strudel is exceptional."

"I've heard that." Another pause. The security man shifted his weight, a subtle prompt. "I sometimes walk past there. On Herrengasse."

It was the smallest of invitations, carefully worded, plausibly deniable. Max felt a flicker of something unexpected—not triumph at the successful manipulation, but something uncomfortably close to guilt.

"Then I hope our paths cross again," he said.

Elena nodded once, then turned toward the exit. Dmitri fell into step beside her, joined by his partner. Max watched them move through the gallery, noting how the security detail positioned themselves—one slightly ahead, one behind, boxing her in without appearing to.

At the doorway, Elena paused. She glanced back, her eyes finding his across the room.

The look lasted only a heartbeat, but Max felt its weight. There was longing in it, and loneliness, and something else he couldn't quite name. Then she was gone, disappearing into the museum's grand hallway, her footsteps echoing on marble.

Max remained where he was, standing before the Fabergé egg they'd been discussing—an exquisite creation of gold and enamel, beautiful and hollow. Through the arched doorway, he could hear the security team's radio chatter, low and efficient.

He pulled out his phone, pretending to check messages, while his mind catalogued every detail of the past hour. The operation was proceeding exactly as planned. Elena had taken the bait. The seed was planted.

So why did he feel like he'd just done something he couldn't take back?

Through the tall windows, he caught a glimpse of a black Mercedes pulling away from the museum entrance, its windows tinted dark. He imagined Elena inside, returning to whatever gilded cage awaited her in the diplomatic quarter.

Max pocketed his phone and turned back to the exhibition, but the art held no interest now. The gallery felt emptier than it had before, despite the other patrons milling about.

He needed to report in. Langley would want to know the first contact was successful.

But first, he needed a drink.

**Scene 6: Alone in the museum after Elen...**

**Scene 6: Alone in the museum after Elena departs**

Max stood motionless in the Imperial Gallery, listening to Elena's footsteps fade into the museum's marble silence. The click of her heels echoed through the vaulted spaces, each sound growing fainter until it was swallowed entirely by the weight of centuries-old art surrounding him.

He exhaled slowly, only then realizing he'd been holding his breath.

The Fabergé egg gleamed under its spotlight, its golden surface catching the light in ways that seemed almost alive. Max approached it again, studying the intricate enamel work—the same craftsmanship he'd discussed with Elena moments ago. His reflection ghosted across the protective glass, distorted and unfamiliar.

*Michael Brennan*. The name sat uncomfortably in his mouth now that she was gone.

He pulled out his phone, typing a brief message to Langley: *First contact established. Target receptive. Proceeding to phase two.*

Professional. Clinical. Exactly as it should be.

Max pocketed the phone and walked toward the windows overlooking the Ringstrasse. Late afternoon sun slanted through the glass, painting golden rectangles across the parquet floor. Outside, Vienna moved with its usual unhurried elegance—trams gliding past, pedestrians strolling beneath the bare trees of late autumn.

Somewhere out there, Elena was climbing into a car. Returning to Volkov's world of armed drivers and encrypted phones and secrets that could reshape the global order.

And she'd smiled at him. Really smiled—not the practiced curve of lips that diplomats and spies deployed like weapons, but something genuine. When he'd made that joke about American tourists photographing their lunch, her laugh had been spontaneous, unguarded. For just a moment, the careful mask had slipped.

Max pressed his palm against the cool window glass.

This was textbook so far. He'd established the cover identity, created common ground, planted the seeds for future "accidental" encounters. Opera at the Staatsoper. Morning coffee at Café Central. He'd given her breadcrumbs, and she'd picked them up eagerly—perhaps too eagerly.

That loneliness in her eyes. He hadn't expected it to be so naked, so raw.

*She's the target*, he reminded himself. *Volkov's mistress. Your access point to one of the most dangerous men in the intelligence world.*

But his hand was trembling slightly against the glass.

Max had run dozens of operations. He'd seduced assets in Moscow, Beirut, Shanghai—places where betrayal was currency and trust was a weapon. He knew how to read people, how to find the pressure points in their armor and exploit them with surgical precision. He'd broken hardened operatives and turned ideological zealots. He'd done things that kept him awake at night, staring at hotel room ceilings in cities whose names he couldn't remember.

This should be no different.

He turned back to the gallery, his footsteps loud in the emptiness. The imperial portraits watched him with their painted eyes—czars and czarinas frozen in oil and canvas, their empires long turned to dust. They'd played their games of power and intrigue too, he supposed. They'd used people, discarded them, sacrificed them on the altar of ambition.

How many of them had hesitated?

Max stopped in front of a portrait of Catherine the Great. She stared back at him with knowing eyes, as if she could see through the centuries into this moment, into him.

"You'd tell me to do whatever it takes," he muttered to the painting. "Wouldn't you?"

The silence offered no absolution.

He thought about the way Elena had touched the display case when discussing the Fabergé egg, her fingers hovering just above the glass as if she could feel the history radiating from within. The way she'd tilted her head when listening to him, really listening, as if his words mattered. The subtle catch in her voice when she'd mentioned that beautiful things often carried hidden sorrows.

*She was talking about herself.*

Max's jaw tightened. He was already analyzing her, cataloging her vulnerabilities, building the psychological profile that would let him manipulate her with maximum efficiency. It was automatic now, instinctive—the predator sizing up prey.

Except she hadn't felt like prey.

She'd felt like someone he might have wanted to know, in another life. In a world where he wasn't Max Monroe and she wasn't Dmitri Volkov's mistress and they were just two people who'd met in a museum and talked about art.

"Christ," he whispered, running a hand through his hair.

He pulled out his phone again, staring at the message he'd sent to Langley. Three sentences. Thirty-seven years of training and experience reduced to bureaucratic shorthand.

His thumb hovered over the screen, but he didn't type anything else. What would he say? *Target displays exploitable emotional vulnerability*? *Subject appears isolated within Volkov's circle*? *Asset recruitment probability high*?

Or the truth: *I liked her.*

Max shoved the phone away and strode toward the exit, his footsteps sharp and decisive. The museum guard nodded at him as he passed, and Max returned the gesture, Michael Brennan's easy American smile sliding effortlessly into place.

Outside, the Vienna cold hit him like a slap. He welcomed it, the sharp air clearing his head. A tram rumbled past, and he watched it disappear around the corner, carrying its cargo of ordinary people living ordinary lives.

He'd see Elena again. At the opera, probably, or at Café Central. He'd deepen the connection, gain her trust, make her believe that Michael Brennan understood her in ways that Volkov never could. He'd offer her glimpses of freedom, of a life beyond gilded cages and dangerous men. And when the moment was right, when she was vulnerable enough and desperate enough, he'd ask her to betray the man she slept beside.

It was the job. It was what he did.

Max turned up his collar against the wind and started walking, no particular destination in mind. His reflection tracked him in the shop windows he passed—a man in an expensive coat, successful and confident, exactly what he appeared to be.

But inside, in the places he'd learned to lock away during operations, something had shifted. A hairline fracture in the armor he'd spent decades perfecting.

He told himself it didn't matter. He told himself it was just first-contact adrenaline, the natural high of a successful deployment. By tomorrow, it would fade. By next week, Elena would be just another file, another operation, another necessary deception in service of the greater good.

He told himself all of this as he walked through the darkening streets of Vienna, and he almost believed it.

Almost.
