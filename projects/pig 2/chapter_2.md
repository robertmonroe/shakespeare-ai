## Chapter 2: Secrets and Squeals

**Scene 1: Johnny brings Arnie into his b...**edroom, kicking the door shut with his heel. He leaned against it, panting slightly, a nervous energy buzzing beneath his skin. Arnie, nestled in his arms, grunted softly, a wet nose nudging Johnny’s chin.

“Okay, buddy, we’re safe now,” Johnny whispered, glancing around his sanctuary. It was small, crammed with posters of his favorite bands, a half-finished model airplane hanging precariously from the ceiling, and clothes erupting from an overflowing laundry basket. The air smelled vaguely of old pizza and unwashed socks, a scent Johnny barely registered anymore.

He gently lowered Arnie onto the worn rug beside his bed. The pig, blinking in the dim light filtering through the grimy window, took a tentative step, his tiny hooves clicking softly against the wood floorboards that showed through the rug’s faded floral pattern. He sniffed the air, his snout twitching, then let out a contented oink that echoed in the small space.

Johnny winced. “Shhh! Keep it down. My parents can’t know you’re here.” He quickly grabbed a tattered beach towel from the back of his desk chair and spread it out for Arnie. “Here you go, buddy. Your new bed.”

Arnie regarded the towel with suspicion for a moment, then snuffled at it, digging his nose into the fabric. He circled twice, then plopped down with a satisfied sigh. Johnny felt a wave of relief wash over him. He was actually doing it. He was hiding a pig.

He knelt beside Arnie, scratching him behind the ears. The pig wriggled with pleasure, letting out a series of soft, happy squeals. “You’re gonna like it here, Arnie,” Johnny said, his voice thick with determination. “I promise. It might be a little cramped, but we’ll make it work. We’ll be best friends.”

He reached out and stroked Arnie's bristly back. "I'm going to keep you safe." The words felt heavy, a promise to a creature he’d only just met, but a promise he intended to keep. He knew this was insane, hiding a pig in a cramped city apartment, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that Arnie needed him.

The rumble of his stomach reminded him that he hadn’t eaten since lunch. And Arnie probably hadn’t eaten at all. He chewed his lip. Getting food without raising suspicion was going to be tricky. “Okay, stay here,” Johnny whispered. “I need to get you something to eat. Just… try not to, you know, *pig out* on my socks. Seriously.”

He paused, listening for any sounds outside his door. Silence. He slowly opened the door a crack and peered into the hallway. Empty. He took a deep breath. This was going to be harder than he thought. And the hardest part, he knew, was only just beginning.

**Scene 2: It's dinner time. Johnny nervo...**

The aroma of Dad’s famous spaghetti and meatballs hung heavy in the air, usually Johnny’s favorite. Tonight, however, it felt like an olfactory interrogation. Each meaty whiff was a question: "Are you really going to feed *all* that to a pig, Johnny?"

He sat at the dining room table, a fortress of beige laminate, trying to appear casual. The flickering light from the cheap overhead fixture bounced off his parents’ faces, highlighting Mom’s concerned frown and Dad’s oblivious, spaghetti-sauce-splattered grin.

"Eat up, Johnny-boy," Dad boomed, twirling a forkful of noodles high above his plate. "You’re wasting away!"

Johnny mumbled something about "not being that hungry," picking at his pasta with the intensity of an archaeologist unearthing a fragile artifact. His stomach churned, not with hunger, but with anxiety. Each bite he *didn't* take was one less for Arnie, who was undoubtedly wreaking havoc in his room. He could practically hear the little snorts and rustling from behind the closed door.

"You okay, honey?" Mom asked, her voice laced with suspicion. She always knew when he was up to something. Years of concealing questionable school reports had honed her parental radar to laser precision. "You haven't touched your garlic bread."

Garlic bread! Arnie would devour that in seconds. “Just…not feeling well,” Johnny croaked, pushing the bread further away. He decided a stealth operation was in order.

Leaning back in his chair, he waited for Dad to launch into one of his rambling stories about work. Perfect. As Dad gestured wildly, mid-sentence, Johnny swiftly scooped a generous pile of spaghetti and two meatballs onto his spoon. He then casually—or at least, he hoped it was casual—dropped the spoon into his napkin.

"…and then Bob in accounting says to me…" Dad continued, oblivious.

Johnny excused himself. "Bathroom break!" he announced, his voice a little too high-pitched. He clutched the napkin, now a soggy, meatball-stained package, and practically sprinted to his room.

He slipped inside, quickly shutting the door behind him. The room smelled…distinctly piggier than it had an hour ago. Arnie, bless his greedy little heart, was snuffling contentedly in the corner, surrounded by shredded comic books and a suspicious-looking damp patch on his favorite Star Wars rug.

"Here you go, buddy," Johnny whispered, unwrapping the napkin and placing the offering before Arnie. The piglet didn’t hesitate, inhaling the pasta in a matter of seconds. Johnny felt a surge of guilty pleasure. He was a master smuggler.

Back at the table, Dad was still holding court, his story now involving a photocopier malfunction and a disgruntled pigeon. Johnny, fueled by a renewed sense of purpose, decided to push his luck.

"These meatballs are *really* good, Dad," he said, reaching for the serving dish. He piled three more onto his plate, then, under the guise of cutting them, discreetly slid them into his lap.

"Glad you like them!" Dad beamed. "Secret family recipe, you know."

Johnny managed a weak smile. He excused himself again. "Uh, gotta…water the plants!" He blurted out, grabbing his plate.

Mom's eyebrows shot up. They didn’t *have* plants.

As he retreated to his room, the telltale *snort* of a happy pig echoed slightly too loudly through the apartment. Johnny froze, listening intently. He heard Mom clear her throat.

"Johnny seems…distracted tonight, don't you think, dear?" she said, her voice carrying a dangerous edge.

Dad, mid-mouthful of spaghetti, simply grunted in agreement.

Johnny closed his bedroom door, his heart hammering. He was walking a tightrope, and the net below was rapidly disintegrating. This was going to be harder than he thought. He glanced at Arnie, now happily chewing on a stray noodle. He knew he wouldn’t trade his little buddy for anything. But maybe, just maybe, he needed a new strategy. And fast.

**Scene 3: Johnny's parents begin to noti...**

**Scene 3: Johnny's parents begin to notice strange noises...**

The old grandfather clock in the living room chimed midnight, each bong echoing through the otherwise silent apartment. Mom, perched on the edge of the couch with a mug of chamomile tea, jumped slightly. Dad, engrossed in a documentary about deep-sea creatures, lowered the volume.

"Did you hear that?" Mom whispered, her brow furrowed.

Dad paused the TV. "Hear what, Martha? The crushing loneliness of a bioluminescent anglerfish?"

"No, before that. It sounded like…a snuffling?"

Dad chuckled, a deep rumble in his chest. "Martha, you’re imagining things. It’s probably just the pipes. This building’s ancient."

He pressed play, but Mom remained unconvinced. She got up and crept towards the hallway, her slippers padding softly on the worn carpet. Dad sighed and muted the TV again.

A faint *oink* reached her from behind Johnny's closed bedroom door. Her eyes widened. She pressed her ear against the wood, then quickly straightened as Dad approached.

"See? Nothing," she said, trying to sound casual, but her voice was tight.

Dad joined her, listening intently. The only sound was the gentle hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen.

“Must have been the TV,” he said, unconvinced himself.

Suddenly, a series of loud thuds, followed by a frustrated squeal, erupted from Johnny's room. Both parents recoiled, exchanging bewildered glances.

"Okay, that wasn't the TV," Dad said, his voice rising slightly. He knocked sharply on the door. "Johnny? Everything alright in there?"

A moment of strained silence hung in the air, thick with unspoken questions. Then, a muffled voice.

"Uh… yeah! Fine! Just… uh… exercising!"

"Exercising? At midnight?" Mom asked, her voice laced with suspicion.

"Yeah! Gotta… gotta stay in shape, you know?" Johnny’s voice sounded higher pitched than usual, strained.

Another thud, followed by a sharp yelp that definitely wasn't human.

Dad’s eyebrows shot up. “Exercising with… animals? Are you alright, son? Are you hurt?”

"No! No animals! I mean... I was imagining I was wrestling a bear! For motivation! Method exercising!" Johnny's voice cracked on the last word.

Mom and Dad stared at each other, their faces mirroring a mixture of concern and utter bewilderment.

“Wrestling a bear in your dreams, son? You're sleepwalking again, aren't you?” Dad said, remembering a similar episode from Johnny’s childhood involving a kitchen spatula and a pronouncement of war against the toaster.

“Yeah! Sleepwalking! That’s it! Super… uh… vivid dreams,” Johnny mumbled. "Everything's cool. Just… gonna get back to wrestling the… dream bear."

Another smaller, less violent thud followed by a soft *snort*. This time, Johnny's voice came out much louder: "Get back here, you imaginary beast! I'll teach you to mess with my REM cycle!"

Mom put a hand to her forehead. "I think we need to talk to Dr. Ramirez about his sleeping habits again. He hasn't sleepwalked like this since he was ten!"

Dad nodded, a weary expression on his face. "Agreed. But first… I'm going to check the door. Just to make sure he hasn't actually brought a bear home." He started to reach for the doorknob.

Before he could touch it, Johnny called out, his voice a desperate plea. "Dad! Please! I'm really trying to concentrate! Don't… disturb my… mental dojo!"

Dad hesitated, his hand hovering in the air. He glanced at Mom, who shrugged, her face a mask of exasperation.

"Alright, son," he said, backing away slowly. "But if we hear any more bears, real or imaginary, we're coming in."

He turned to Mom, shaking his head. "This is getting out of hand. I’m going to make sure he gets that appointment with Doctor Ramirez rescheduled for tomorrow. This ‘mental dojo’ and imaginary bear wrestling is keeping us awake."

**Scene 4: Arnie starts making noticeable...**

The hallway reeked. Not of garbage or mildew, but of something…farm-like. Johnny sprayed a liberal dose of "Ocean Breeze" air freshener, the sickly sweet scent clashing horribly with the underlying aroma. He coughed, waving his hand in front of his face. He’d gone through half a can already that day.

“What are you doing, Johnny?” His mom stood in the doorway of the living room, newspaper crinkled in her hand, nose wrinkled.

“Uh…science!” Johnny stammered, spraying another burst of artificial ocean. “I’m…testing different air fresheners to see which one eliminates the…the, uh…most…bacteria.”

His mom raised a skeptical eyebrow. “Bacteria? What bacteria?”

“The bacteria I’m…growing. In my room. For science.” He winced internally. He needed to work on his improv skills. Arnie chose that exact moment to let out a loud, contented *OINK*.

Johnny froze, his spray can hovering mid-air. His mom's eyes narrowed. The newspaper slipped from her grasp and landed with a soft thud.

“Johnny…was that…a pig?” Her voice was dangerously calm.

“A…a fig? Did you say fig? No, Mom. It’s…it’s a new sound effect for my video game! Remember I told you? It's a hyper-realistic boar sound. I’m trying to make my game as immersive as possible!” He attempted a casual laugh, but it came out as a high-pitched squeak.

Dad emerged from the kitchen, wiping his mouth with a napkin. “Boar sound? The whole apartment smells like a county fair! And I think I saw…straw…under your door earlier.”

Johnny swallowed hard. He had forgotten to sweep up the escapee straw from his makeshift pen. “Straw is…part of the experiment! It…it helps the…bacteria grow! It's a…a control variable!"

His mom took a step closer, her eyes fixed on Johnny’s bedroom door. “A control variable that sounds remarkably like a pig snorting?”

Another, louder *OINK* emanated from the room, followed by the distinct sound of something heavy rooting around in…well, probably in something. Johnny internally screamed.

"Okay, okay!" Johnny threw his hands up in mock exasperation. "Fine! You caught me! It’s… a…virtual reality simulation! I'm creating a super-realistic farm environment. I told you I was getting serious about game design!"

He grabbed the door handle, blocking his mom's path. "But you can't come in! It’s…still calibrating. The sensory overload might…might overwhelm you!” He gave her his most winning smile, the one that usually worked when he wanted extra screen time.

His mom, however, wasn’t smiling. Her eyes were glued to a slowly widening damp patch on the hallway carpet, seeping from under Johnny’s door. The smell, amplified by the moisture, was now undeniable.

“Johnny,” she said, her voice low and firm, "I think we need to have a serious talk about your 'virtual reality' simulation. And maybe call a plumber about whatever's causing this…dampness.”

She reached past him, her hand closing on the doorknob. Johnny knew, with a sinking feeling, that his carefully constructed lies were about to crumble. He could hear Arnie shifting inside, a happy grunt escaping his snout.

"Mom, wait! Just...just one more minute!" he pleaded, but his words were lost as she pushed the door open a crack, revealing… just enough.

**Scene 5: Johnny tries to bathe Arnie in...**

The bathroom was a shoebox lined with shiny, avocado-green tiles. The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of expired potpourri. “Okay, Arnie, operation Clean Pig is a go,” Johnny whispered, his voice a strained stage whisper. Arnie, bless his muddy little heart, seemed less than thrilled. He stood planted in the chipped porcelain tub, snorting nervously and eyeing the rubber ducky with deep suspicion.

Johnny had managed to wrestle Arnie into the tub, after much squealing and the near-destruction of the flimsy shower curtain. Now came the hard part: actually washing him.

He turned on the water, testing the temperature. Lukewarm, hopefully pig-friendly. He aimed the showerhead at Arnie’s rear.

A high-pitched squeal, so loud it vibrated through the tiny room, erupted from Arnie. He tried to bolt, scrabbling at the slick porcelain. Water splashed everywhere – onto the mirrored medicine cabinet, onto the dusty scale in the corner, onto Johnny himself. He grabbed Arnie's slippery back legs.

“Easy, Arnie! Just a little soap!” Johnny yelled over the pig’s protestations. He squirted a dollop of his mom’s lavender-scented shampoo onto Arnie’s back. The pig went ballistic.

Suddenly, a loud BANG echoed from downstairs, followed by a muffled shout.

Johnny froze, his heart hammering against his ribs. He cautiously looked around. The sound of the bang had come from below. And that shout… it sounded a lot like Mrs. Rosenbaum.

Then he saw it. A steady drip, drip, drip was falling from the bathroom ceiling, right next to the light fixture. Johnny's stomach dropped. He hadn't just made a mess; he'd created a crisis.

Panic seized him. He desperately tried to mop up the water sloshing on the floor, but it was a losing battle. The drips were now a steady stream.

“Arnie, stop squealing!” he hissed, though he knew it was useless. The sound of banging grew louder, closer.

"Johnny?" It was his mom's voice, laced with concern. "Is everything alright in there?"

Before Johnny could even stammer out a reply, his dad's booming voice joined in. "Johnny, what was that noise? Mrs. Rosenbaum says water is pouring through her ceiling!"

The doorknob rattled. Johnny stared at it, frozen. Arnie, sensing the change in atmosphere, stopped squealing and simply shivered, his little body trembling. The lock clicked open.

His mom’s face appeared in the doorway, her eyes wide with alarm. Behind her, Dad loomed, his brow furrowed and his hands planted firmly on his hips. Their gazes swept past the soaking wet Johnny, the lavender-scented bubbles clinging to his hair, to the source of the chaos.

Arnie stood in the middle of the tub, a bewildered pig covered in suds, dripping wet, and very, very exposed.

His mom gasped. His dad's jaw dropped. The silence that followed was thick enough to choke on.

"Johnny," his dad finally said, his voice dangerously low. "Explain. Now."

The air was thick with accusation and disbelief, but before Johnny could conjure any believable explanations, a new voice sliced through the tension.

"What in tarnation is going on here?" A booming voice came from the door way. Mrs Rosenbaum marched into the scene, her eyes landing on Arnie and Johnny, before she pointed a wrinkled finger at Johnny's father, "I want this fixed immediately young man. I have a mahjong game to host tonight."

**Scene 6: Johnny deflects his parents qu...**

The bathroom door creaked open, and Mom and Dad stood silhouetted against the hall light. Dad held a wrench, his brow furrowed. “Johnny? We heard… noises. And a lot of water.”

Johnny’s heart hammered against his ribs. He plastered on his most innocent, slightly bewildered expression. “Noises? Water? Uh… I was just… uh… practicing my beatboxing in the shower? You know, trying to get that bass drop just right?” He puffed out his cheeks and made a weak “oomph” sound, hoping it sounded remotely like anything musical.

Mom’s gaze darted around the bathroom, lingering on the damp floor and the slightly ajar shower curtain. “Beatboxing? At 10 p.m.? And what about that… that smell?” She wrinkled her nose delicately.

Arnie chose that precise moment to let out a soft, contented snort from the direction of Johnny’s bedroom. It was muffled, but definitely pig-like.

Johnny’s mind raced. He needed to act, and act fast. He clutched his stomach dramatically, doubling over slightly. "Oh! Oh no! Mom! Dad! It's happening again! The… the appendix pain! Remember? The doctor said it could flare up!” He groaned convincingly, grabbing his abdomen. “I need… chamomile tea… NOW!”

Mom’s face immediately softened with concern. “Oh, honey! Your appendix! Dad, go put the kettle on! Johnny, come on, let’s get you to bed.” She completely forgot about the leaking water and the odd aroma.

Dad, thankfully, didn't need further prompting. He turned on his heel and headed towards the kitchen, muttering something about teenage dramas and appendix scares.

Mom guided Johnny out of the bathroom, her hand protectively on his back. "Don't worry, sweetie. We'll get you all tucked in. It's probably just gas, but better safe than sorry."

As soon as they were in his bedroom, Johnny ushered her towards the door. “Thanks, Mom. I think I just need to lie down. I’ll be fine.” He gave her a weak but reassuring smile.

She patted his cheek. “Alright, dear. Call us if you need anything.”

The moment she closed the door, Johnny slumped against it, weak with relief. He glanced at Arnie, who was watching him with wide, intelligent eyes from beneath the bed. A small puddle of… something… glistened near his snout.

"Oh, Arnie," Johnny whispered, running a hand through his hair. "This is getting way too close. We need to be more careful. A LOT more careful." He knelt down, his voice softening. “Sorry for all the noise, buddy. And for the… beatboxing excuse. I promise, I'll find a better way. I just… I don't know how much longer I can keep you hidden.”

Arnie, in response, let out a tiny, almost silent squeak and nudged Johnny’s hand with his wet snout. A silent apology? A plea for help? Johnny wasn't sure. But one thing was certain: the stakes had just been raised, and he was playing a losing game. He had to figure something out, and fast. The thought of losing Arnie was unbearable. But the thought of his parents finding him… equally terrifying. He pulled himself up, a new resolve hardening his expression. He couldn't afford any more close calls. He had to come up with a real plan, a foolproof plan. And he had to do it before his parents discovered the real source of the "appendix pain" and the beatboxing "bass drops."
