## Chapter 5: The Wild Man

### Scene 1: Awakening

Consciousness returned in fragments—shattered pieces of light and shadow that refused to coalesce into meaning.

Inanna became aware of the smell first. Rich, loamy earth. Decaying vegetation. Something muskier beneath it all, an animal scent that triggered ancient alarm responses in her hindbrain. Her neural interface flickered with corrupted data streams, damage reports scrolling across her vision in stuttering amber text before dissolving into static.

She tried to move. Pain lanced through her left side—ribs, probably cracked. Her leg throbbed with a deep, persistent ache that spoke of torn muscle and possible fracture. The escape pod. The crash. The jungle canopy tearing apart around her as—

A sound. Low, rumbling. Not mechanical.

Inanna forced her eyes open.

Faces stared back at her. Dozens of them, arranged in a rough semicircle among the massive roots of a tree that dwarfed anything in her memory banks. But these were not human faces. They were simian—broad, intelligent, covered in coarse black hair that caught the dappled light filtering through the canopy above.

Great apes. But wrong. *Different.*

Her damaged interface struggled to cross-reference, pulling fragments from corrupted genetic databases. The creatures watching her stood taller than any gorilla on record, their craniums larger, their eyes holding a depth of awareness that sent a chill through her despite the jungle's humid warmth. They moved with deliberate purpose, communicating in soft grunts and subtle gestures that spoke of complex social structure.

*Species unknown,* her interface finally reported. *No genetic match found. Possible engineered variant or isolated evolutionary branch.*

One of the larger apes—a silver-backed male with scars crossing his massive chest—stepped forward. He sniffed the air, nostrils flaring, then made a sound that the others seemed to understand. Several younger apes crept closer, their curiosity apparently overcoming caution.

Inanna's hand moved instinctively toward where her sidearm should have been. Gone. Lost in the crash, along with most of her equipment. She was alone, injured, surrounded by unknown creatures in an environment her people had abandoned millennia ago.

*Threat assessment: Critical.*

But the apes didn't attack. They watched. Studied. One young female reached out a long-fingered hand and touched Inanna's auburn-red hair, then pulled back with a startled hoot, as if surprised by its texture.

An older female—gray around the muzzle, with wise, gentle eyes—settled beside Inanna with surprising care. She made a soft crooning sound, almost maternal, and her massive hand came to rest on Inanna's shoulder with impossible gentleness.

*Kala*, the other apes called her.

Movement at the edge of the group. The apes parted, their attention shifting.

Inanna's breath caught in her throat.

### Scene 2: First Sight (Inanna's POV)

He emerged from the shadows between two massive roots, and everything Inanna thought she knew about beauty, about desire, about the stirrings of the heart—shattered like crystal against stone.

*Human.*

The word echoed through her damaged neural interface, but it was woefully inadequate. The males of her kind were elegant, refined, their beauty calculated and cold—symmetrical features engineered for aesthetic perfection, bodies maintained through genetic optimization and medical precision. She had spent eight centuries surrounded by them, had taken lovers among them, had felt their practiced touches and heard their measured words of admiration.

None of it—*none of it*—had prepared her for this.

He moved like liquid fire through the dappled light, his bronze skin gleaming with the sheen of exertion, every muscle rippling beneath flesh that had been sculpted not by genetic engineers but by the savage demands of survival itself. He was tall—easily six feet—with a powerful build that spoke of a lifetime spent climbing, fighting, hunting. His shoulders were broad, his chest deep and marked with pale lines of ritual scarification that traced geometric patterns across his pectorals. Wild dark hair cascaded past his shoulders in sun-bleached tangles, threaded with leaves and small feathers, framing a face that was...

*Gods of Nibiru.*

His features were strong, almost brutally masculine—a sharp jaw shadowed with stubble, high cheekbones, a nose that had clearly been broken and healed without medical intervention. But it was his eyes that caught her, that *held* her, that made something deep in her belly clench with a sensation she had never experienced in all her long centuries of existence.

Amber-gold. The color of honey held to sunlight, of autumn leaves on the single Earth tree she had once seen in the Nibiru botanical archives. They burned with intelligence, with curiosity, with a wild, untamed fire that the Anunnaki had bred out of their own kind millennia ago.

*Freedom*, she realized. *That's what I'm seeing. He's never known a master. Never bent his knee. Never had his spirit broken and reshaped by civilization's demands.*

The thought sent a shiver through her that had nothing to do with fear.

He crouched at the edge of the group, studying her with an intensity that made her skin prickle with awareness. His nostrils flared—scenting her, she realized, the way the apes had. Reading her with senses she could barely comprehend. His head tilted, and something flickered in those wild amber-gold eyes.

Wonder. Confusion. And something else—something that made her heart stammer against her cracked ribs.

*Recognition.*

Not of her specifically. But of her *kind*. He was looking at her the way she imagined the first Anunnaki explorers had looked at Earth—with the dawning awareness of something precious, something impossible, something that changed everything.

Slowly, with the coiled grace of a predator approaching unknown prey, he moved closer.

Inanna held herself still, but not from training, not from tactical calculation. She couldn't move. Couldn't breathe. Could only watch as this magnificent creature—this *man*, this wild, beautiful, utterly free man—drew near enough that she could smell him.

The scent hit her like a physical force.

Earth and sweat and something muskier, wilder—an animal scent that should have triggered disgust but instead sent heat flooding through her veins. Beneath it, something else: the green bite of crushed leaves, the mineral tang of river water, wood smoke embedded deep in his skin. He smelled like the jungle itself. Like life, raw and unfiltered. The males of Nibiru smelled of synthetic cleanliness, of recycled air and sanitized skin. They touched with calculated precision, spoke with measured words, loved with the efficiency of programmed algorithms.

This man smelled like *freedom*.

*What is happening to me?*

She had thought—had *accepted*—that desire was simply a biological imperative refined into social ritual. A thing of the mind, controlled and contained.

She had been so utterly, catastrophically wrong.

The wild man stopped an arm's length away, and she found herself cataloguing every detail of him with an intensity that bordered on obsession. The way the light caught the bronze planes of his face. The small scars that mapped a lifetime of battle across his skin. The way his muscles coiled beneath flesh as he moved, power barely restrained. The curve of his lips as they parted slightly, drawing in her scent.

She could hear him breathing. Deep, steady, controlled—the breathing of a hunter assessing something new. She could see the pulse beating at his throat, strong and vital. She could feel the heat radiating from his body, warmer than the humid jungle air.

He reached out one calloused hand and touched the fabric at her shoulder.

The contact—even through the synthetic weave of her flight suit—sent electricity racing down her spine. Her breath came faster. Her heart hammered. Every nerve ending in her body seemed to wake from a millennia-long slumber, suddenly *alive* in a way she had never experienced.

And when his amber-gold eyes lifted to meet her blue-green ones, Inanna felt something inside her *crack open*—a door she hadn't known existed, swinging wide to reveal depths she had never explored.

His lips parted. A sound emerged—low, questioning, almost musical despite its roughness. Not quite speech, not quite animal. Something in between, shaped by vocal cords that had learned language from creatures who couldn't truly speak it.

The sound vibrated through her chest like a second heartbeat.

### Scene 3: First Sight (Enkidu's POV)

Enkidu had seen many things in his life.

He had watched the sun rise over the jungle canopy, painting the mist in shades of gold and rose. He had seen the great falls where the river plunged into mist, had felt the spray on his face like the breath of giants. He had witnessed birth and death, the savage beauty of predator and prey, the tender moments when Kala had groomed his hair and hummed the soft sounds that meant *love* in the language of the mangani.

But he had never seen anything like *her*.

She lay in the wreckage of the sky-fire, this impossible creature, and Enkidu's heart hammered against his ribs in a way it never had—not when Sabor stalked through the shadows, not when he'd fought Terkoz for leadership, not when he'd first climbed to the highest branches and seen the world spread out below him like a green ocean.

*She has no fur.*

The thought echoed through him, resonant with meaning he couldn't quite grasp. Like him. She was smooth-skinned like him. Her arms, her legs, her face—all bare, all strange, all *familiar* in a way that made something ache deep in his chest.

But where his skin was bronze, weathered by sun and scarred by battle, hers was pale as moonlight. Porcelain white, like the inside of certain shells he'd found by the river, delicate and luminous in the dappled light. He had never seen skin so pale. It looked soft. Unbearably soft. He wanted to touch it, to see if it felt as smooth as it looked, to know if it would be cool like water or warm like—

And her *hair*.

Enkidu's breath caught. The mangani had fur—black, gray, silver with age. The dark-skinned humans he'd glimpsed at the jungle's edge had hair like night, like shadows. But this creature... this creature wore *fire* on her head.

Auburn-red waves cascaded past her shoulders, catching the light that filtered through the canopy and transforming it into something alive. Copper and rust and deep burgundy, shifting and shimmering like the flames that sometimes danced through the dry season forest. He wanted to touch it. He *needed* to touch it. His fingers ached with the wanting, curling against his palms as he fought the urge.

*Would it burn?* he wondered. *Would it feel like fire?*

He crept closer, and her scent reached him.

It was unlike anything he had ever encountered. Not the earthy musk of the mangani, not the sharp iron-fear of prey, not the green living smell of the jungle. She smelled of something clean and strange—like rain on hot stone, like the air after lightning struck. Beneath that, something softer: a sweet warmth that made his mouth water and his chest tighten with an emotion he had no name for.

*She smells like the sky*, he thought, and the poetry of it would have surprised him if he'd had words for poetry.

But it was her eyes that undid him.

Blue-green, like the deep pools where the river ran slow. Like the sky reflected in still water. Like nothing he had ever seen in all his years of watching and wondering. They shifted as she watched him—now the color of the sky, now the green of new leaves—and they held an intelligence, a depth, a *sadness* that made something inside him want to howl with recognition.

*She is alone*, he realized. *Like me. She is alone.*

He had always been different. Among the mangani, with their dark fur and powerful builds, his bronze skin and strange features marked him as other. Kala loved him—he knew this with the certainty of breath. But even Kala couldn't explain what he was. Even Kala couldn't answer the questions that kept him awake at night, staring at his reflection in jungle pools and wondering why he looked so different from everyone he loved.

Now, looking at this creature from the sky, those questions burned brighter than ever.

*What is she?*

*What am I?*

*Are we... the same?*

He touched the strange material that covered her body—slick and smooth, nothing like hide or fur—and felt her tremble beneath his fingers. Not from fear, he thought. Something else. Something that matched the trembling he felt in his own chest.

Her skin was warm through the strange covering. So warm.

And when her eyes—those impossible, beautiful eyes—met his, Enkidu felt the world tilt beneath him. Something ancient and instinctive stirred in his chest, something that had nothing to do with survival or territory or dominance.

*Mine*, whispered a voice he'd never heard before. *She is mine.*

The thought should have confused him. Instead, it felt like coming home.

He made a sound—low, questioning—the sound he made when he wanted Kala to understand something important. The sound that meant *please* and *stay* and *I mean no harm*.

He hoped she understood.

### Scene 4: Names

*"Tarzan,"* the apes murmured among themselves, gesturing toward the wild man. The word rippled through the troop, accompanied by gestures toward his bronze skin—lighter than the dark-skinned tribes the apes had occasionally glimpsed at the jungle's distant edges, though deeply tanned from years under the equatorial sun.

The old female—Kala—made a soft sound, almost maternal, as she watched the wild man crouch beside Inanna. Her massive hand still rested on Inanna's shoulder, warm and reassuring despite its size.

Inanna found her voice, though it emerged as little more than a croak. "I'm... I'm not going to hurt anyone."

The apes went still.

Every massive head turned toward her. Every dark eye fixed on her face. The silence that followed was absolute, broken only by the distant calls of birds and the endless drip of water. She had spoken, and they had *listened*.

The wild man leaned forward, nostrils flaring, and something shifted in his expression. Not fear—she doubted this creature knew the meaning of fear. Fascination, perhaps. The same fascination she felt looking at him.

Kala rumbled something low and questioning. The wild man responded in those strange, grunting sounds that somehow conveyed meaning, his human vocal cords producing approximations of ape-speech that defied everything Inanna knew about linguistic development.

Then he did something unexpected.

He placed one scarred, calloused hand flat against his chest—right over his heart—and made a sound. Not a grunt. Not an ape-call.

A *word*.

"Enkidu."

The syllables hung in the humid air, strange and sacred. Inanna's damaged interface flickered, attempting to cross-reference, finding nothing. But she didn't need a database to understand what he was doing.

He was giving her his name.

She felt tears prick at her eyes—an autonomic response she'd thought she'd evolved beyond. Here, in this savage paradise, surrounded by creatures that should not exist, this beautiful wild man was offering her the most precious gift one being could give another.

*Identity. Trust. Connection.*

Slowly, deliberately, she mirrored his gesture—placing her own pale, slender hand against her chest. Her fingers trembled. Her voice caught. But she managed to speak.

"Inanna."

His reaction was immediate and startling. His amber-gold eyes went wide, his breath catching audibly. He spoke in a rush of those grunting sounds, hands moving in sharp gestures, and she caught a pattern repeated several times—sounds that might have been *human, human, human*.

Then he pointed at her, then at himself, and brought his hands together, fingers interlacing.

*Same.*

The gesture was simple. Unmistakable.

*We are the same.*

Inanna stared at their joined hands in her mind's eye—her pale, slender fingers; his scarred and calloused ones, bronze against her porcelain. Same shape. Same structure. She looked at his face, at the features that were strange and yet somehow familiar—the high cheekbones, the full lips, the wild beauty of him—and understanding crashed over her like a wave.

He had been alone.

For his entire life, surrounded by creatures who loved him but could never truly be his kind, he had been *alone*.

Until now.

A sound escaped him—something between a laugh and a sob—and before she could react, he reached for her again. Not to examine. Not to satisfy curiosity. Just to *touch*. To confirm that she was real.

His palm pressed against hers, and his fingers curled around her hand, and the contact sent electricity racing through every nerve in Inanna's body.

*Same*, his touch seemed to say. *You are mine. My kind. My people.*

*Mine.*

And somewhere deep inside her—in a place that millennia of civilization had never quite managed to tame—Inanna felt an answering recognition.

*Yours.*

### Scene 5: A Moment of Wonder

What followed was the strangest and most beautiful hour of Inanna's four thousand years of existence.

Enkidu seemed unable to stop touching her—her hair, her hands, the fabric of her suit—as if reassuring himself that she was real. Each contact sent fresh shivers through her nervous system, her body responding to him with an intensity that should have frightened her.

It didn't. It felt *right*.

He brought her water in a broad leaf, holding it carefully to her lips with a tenderness that contradicted everything about his savage appearance. The water was cool and sweet, tasting of minerals and green growing things. She drank, and he watched her throat move with naked wonder in his eyes.

Then he disappeared into the canopy above.

Inanna felt a flash of panic—*don't leave, don't go*—but before she could call out, he was back, dropping lightly from the branches with something cupped in his hands.

Fruit. Wild and strange, with a tough mottled skin that he cracked open easily with his thumbs. Inside, the flesh was golden, glistening with juice.

He held a piece to her lips.

The intimacy of the gesture stole her breath. On Nibiru, food was processed, sanitized, consumed in precise nutritional portions. The idea of one person *feeding* another was almost unseemly, reserved for the very young or the very ill.

But here, in this green cathedral, with this wild man offering her the fruit of his home, it felt like a sacrament.

She parted her lips. Took the fruit. The flavor exploded across her tongue—sweet and tart and utterly foreign, juice running down her chin.

Enkidu laughed.

The sound transformed his face. The wariness faded, the predator's stillness softened, and for a moment he looked impossibly young, impossibly joyful. The laugh was rusty, unpracticed—perhaps he had little reason to laugh in his harsh life—but it was *real* in a way that nothing had been real for her in centuries.

Inanna found herself laughing too, a helpless giggle escaping her despite the pain in her ribs. When had she last laughed? Truly laughed, not the polite musical sounds of Anunnaki social ritual?

She couldn't remember.

Enkidu reached out and wiped the juice from her chin with his thumb. The touch was gentle, almost reverent. Then he brought his thumb to his own lips and tasted the juice, his amber-gold eyes never leaving hers.

*You*, his expression seemed to say. *I want to know everything about you.*

He began to gesture, pointing at things and making sounds. Tree. Sky. Water. Sun. Teaching her, she realized with sudden wonder. Teaching her his language, the same way he must have learned it from the apes who raised him.

She repeated the sounds as best she could, mangling them terribly, and each attempt made him smile. Not the feral grin of a predator—a *smile*, warm and encouraging, patient in a way she wouldn't have expected from such a wild creature.

When she finally got a word right—*water*, or close enough—he grabbed her hand and pressed it to his chest, over his heart, as if her small victory was his own joy.

For that one perfect hour, there was no genocide coming, no Cleansing, no impossible mission. There was only this: a man and a woman, finding each other against all odds, learning each other word by word, touch by touch.

Kala sat nearby, watching them with wise, gentle eyes, making soft sounds of approval.

Even Kerchak, the scarred silver-back who led the troop, seemed to accept her presence, settling on his haunches at the clearing's edge with something like contentment.

Inanna felt the afternoon light shift, golden and warm, and she thought: *This is happiness. This is what happiness feels like.*

She had forgotten.

Then the wind changed.

---

### Scene 6: Sabor

The scent hit the clearing before the beast did—a musk of ancient death that made even the great apes freeze mid-motion.

Inanna felt it first as a wrongness in the air, a primal warning that bypassed her rational mind and spoke directly to the terrified animal buried deep in her brainstem. The jungle had gone silent. No birds. No insects. Even the wind seemed to hold its breath.

Kerchak's massive head snapped toward the treeline, nostrils flaring. A rumble built in his chest—not a challenge, but a warning. The other apes scattered toward the canopy with surprising speed for their bulk, mothers clutching infants to their chests.

Enkidu rose from his crouch beside Inanna, every muscle in his powerful body going taut as a bowstring. His nostrils twitched, reading the wind like scripture, and what he found there turned his sun-darkened bronze face ashen.

*"Sabor,"* he breathed.

The name meant nothing to Inanna, but the way he said it—like a curse, like a prayer—told her everything.

Then the undergrowth exploded.

The creature that burst from the green wall was nightmare made flesh. Inanna's enhanced memory banks had contained files on prehistoric megafauna, clinical descriptions of Smilodon and its kin, but nothing had prepared her for the reality of a sabertooth in motion. It was easily three meters long, a rippling mass of tawny muscle and killing intent. Its curved fangs, each as long as her forearm, gleamed wet with saliva as it fixed its amber eyes on the wounded prey bleeding on the jungle floor.

On *her*.

Terror seized Inanna's chest, crushing the air from her lungs. She tried to move, to crawl, to do anything but lie there like an offering on an altar, but her damaged body refused to obey. The beast's gaze pinned her in place, ancient and hungry and utterly without mercy.

The sabertooth gathered itself to spring.

And Enkidu moved.

He didn't run—running implied thought, decision, the space between impulse and action. He simply *flowed* into the predator's path, his bone knife appearing in his fist as if conjured from the air itself. A sound tore from his throat, something between a roar and a scream, a challenge that made the great cat hesitate for one crucial heartbeat.

That heartbeat saved Inanna's life.

The sabertooth adjusted its trajectory, redirecting its killing lunge toward this new threat that dared to stand between it and its meal. Enkidu didn't try to dodge—there was no time, no space. Instead, he threw himself *into* the attack, twisting his powerful body at the last possible instant so those terrible fangs slashed through empty air instead of his throat.

They hit the ground together in a tangle of limbs and fur and fury.

Inanna watched in horrified fascination as Enkidu fought with a savagery that matched the beast's own. His knife rose and fell, rose and fell, seeking the vulnerable spots—the eyes, the throat, the soft belly—while his free hand gripped a fistful of the creature's mane, keeping those fangs inches from his face. Blood sprayed in crimson arcs, painting the ferns and flowers with violence.

The sabertooth raked its hind claws down Enkidu's side, opening furrows in his bronze flesh that made Inanna cry out in sympathetic agony. He didn't scream. He didn't even flinch. He just drove his knife into the beast's shoulder and *twisted*, drawing a yowling shriek of pain from the predator.

*He's protecting me*, Inanna realized with sudden, startling clarity. *He's dying to protect me, and he doesn't even know who I am.*

No one had ever done that for her. Not the courtiers who whispered flattery in her ears. Not the suitors who competed for her favor with calculated gifts. Not even Enki, who loved her in her own cowardly way.

This wild man, this stranger, was putting his body between her and death.

Because she was *his kind*.

Because some instinct deeper than thought, older than civilization, demanded it.

The fight continued, terrible and beautiful in its primal brutality. Enkidu moved with a grace that transcended human capability—he had learned to fight from creatures twice his size, had survived in a jungle that killed the weak without mercy. His bronze body twisted and struck, retreated and attacked, each motion flowing into the next like water over stone.

Finally, with a sound that was part roar, part prayer, he drove his knife up under the sabertooth's jaw and into its brain.

The great cat shuddered. Its amber eyes—so like Enkidu's own—went dim. And then it collapsed, its massive weight pinning him to the earth.

For a long moment, silence.

Then Enkidu pushed himself free of the corpse, staggering to his feet. Blood poured from the wounds on his side, his arm, his chest. He swayed, caught himself, and turned to look at Inanna.

Their eyes met.

And despite the pain, despite the blood, despite the reality of the death he had just dealt, his lips curved into the ghost of a smile.

*Safe*, his expression seemed to say. *You are safe.*

Then his eyes rolled back, and he crumpled to the jungle floor.

"No!" Inanna's cry echoed through the trees as she dragged herself toward him, ignoring the agony in her ribs, the fire in her leg. She reached his side and pressed her trembling hands to the wounds on his chest, feeling his blood—warm, so warm—seeping between her fingers.

*Don't die*, she thought, the words cycling through her mind like a prayer. *Don't you dare die. Not now. Not when I've just found you.*

Kala appeared beside her, the old ape's face twisted with grief. Together—the alien princess and the ape mother—they worked to stem the bleeding, to save the wild man who belonged to them both.

And somewhere in the ancient darkness of the jungle, the first seeds of love took root in blood-soaked soil.

As all the great loves do.
