    1. Scene 3 opens with Johnny noticing Arnie escaping from a petting zoo, even though there's been no prior mention of there being a petting zoo in the area. I suggest a scene where Johnny sees posters of the missing pig near the butcher shop or has some interaction with the workers there that gives a hint of a nearby petting zoo.
    2. In Scene 4, Johnny fashions a rope leash from his backpack strap. By Scene 5, the same leash is referred to as "makeshift" and it may have been implied already, but explicitly stating it was the backpack leash will help.
