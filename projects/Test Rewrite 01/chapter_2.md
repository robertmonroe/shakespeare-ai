## Chapter 2: The Weight of Secrets

**Scene 1: Marcus struggles to keep up wi...**

**Scene 1: Marcus struggles to keep up with Bruno's growing appetite**

Marcus stood in front of the open refrigerator, the cool air washing over his face as he calculated what he could take without raising alarms. His mother had gone upstairs to fold laundry—he had maybe five minutes.

The leftover meatloaf from dinner sat in a glass container, still half-full. His fingers hovered over it, then moved to the deli turkey instead. Less obvious. He grabbed the package, then added a block of cheddar cheese, three apples, and the remains of yesterday's rotisserie chicken that had been picked nearly clean.

His backpack sat open on the kitchen counter, already stuffed with two boxes of granola bars he'd taken from the pantry that morning. He crammed the food inside, the zipper straining as he forced it closed.

"Marcus? You down there?"

His heart jackhammered against his ribs. "Yeah, Mom!"

"Can you bring up the fabric softener when you come? I left it by the washer!"

"Sure!" His voice came out too high, too tight.

He slung the heavy backpack over his shoulder and headed for the garage door, pausing only to grab a gallon of milk. Bruno had developed a taste for it, lapping it up from the paint tray Marcus had repurposed as a feeding dish.

The garage was dim in the fading afternoon light, and for a moment, Marcus couldn't see him. Then a shuffling sound came from behind the stack of storage boxes, and Bruno emerged, already twice the size he'd been two weeks ago. His fur had thickened, glossy and dark, and his paws seemed enormous compared to his body—like he was growing into them piece by piece.

"Hey, buddy," Marcus whispered, kneeling down as Bruno bounded toward him with that rolling, clumsy gait that still held traces of puppyish awkwardness.

But when Bruno reared up to greet him, planting his paws on Marcus's chest, the impact nearly knocked him backward. The cub was *heavy* now, solid muscle beneath the soft fur.

"Okay, okay, down." Marcus tried to push him gently, but Bruno didn't budge, his wet nose snuffling at the backpack. The smell of food had him fixated, a low whining sound building in his throat.

Marcus unzipped the bag and pulled out the turkey, unwrapping it as fast as his shaking hands would allow. Bruno snatched it from his fingers before he could set it down, gulping it in three massive swallows.

"Slow down, you're gonna choke—"

But Bruno was already nosing at the backpack again, more insistent this time. Marcus pulled out the chicken, then the cheese, then the apples, watching in something close to horror as Bruno devoured everything in minutes. It wasn't enough. It was never enough anymore.

The cub looked up at him with those dark, intelligent eyes, and Marcus saw something that made his stomach clench—not the helpless infant he'd found in the woods, but something wilder. Something that was outgrowing this concrete box with its stacks of Christmas decorations and rusty tools.

A scratch at the garage door made them both freeze.

"Marcus?" His mother's voice, closer now. "What are you doing out here? It's almost dark."

Bruno's ears swiveled toward the sound. Marcus's hand shot out, gripping the scruff of the cub's neck—thicker now, harder to hold. "Stay," he hissed.

"Just—just looking for my old baseball glove!" He moved toward the door, positioning himself to block any view inside. "For gym class!"

He cracked the door open six inches. His mother stood there in her work clothes, arms crossed, a crease of worry between her eyebrows.

"In the dark?"

"I was about to turn the light on."

She studied his face, and Marcus felt sweat prickling along his hairline despite the October chill. Behind him, he heard Bruno's claws clicking on the concrete floor.

"What was that noise?"

"What noise?" The words tumbled out too fast.

"That... scratching sound."

"Probably just rats. I'll set some traps." Marcus squeezed through the gap and pulled the door firmly shut behind him, his back pressed against it. "I should really get started on my homework anyway."

His mother's frown deepened. "Speaking of which, Mrs. Chen emailed me. She said you haven't turned in your last two English assignments."

Marcus's mind went blank. Had it been two? He'd lost track of days, of deadlines, of everything except feeding schedules and cleaning up after Bruno and making sure no one heard the increasingly loud sounds coming from the garage.

"I'll make them up. I promise."

"And the food, Marcus." She gestured back toward the kitchen. "I just bought groceries three days ago, and half of it's already gone. I know you're a growing boy, but this is getting ridiculous. Are you having friends over when I'm at work?"

"No, I just—I've been really hungry lately. Growth spurt, like you said."

She looked at him for a long moment, and Marcus forced himself to hold her gaze, to keep his expression open and innocent even as guilt twisted like a knife in his gut.

"Alright," she finally said. "But we need to talk about budgeting. I can't keep buying this much food every week. And get your homework done. No more excuses."

"Yes, ma'am."

She turned back toward the house, and Marcus sagged against the garage door, his legs suddenly weak. Behind him, Bruno whined again—still hungry, always hungry—and scratched at the door with those razor-sharp claws that were getting longer every day.

Marcus pulled out his phone. 6:47 PM. He had a history test tomorrow he hadn't studied for, an English essay due Friday that he hadn't started, and math homework he didn't even understand. His backpack for school was still in his room, unopened since this morning.

But Bruno needed more food. And the garage needed cleaning—it was starting to smell, despite Marcus's best efforts. And there was a torn garbage bag in the corner that needed replacing before his mother decided to come out here and investigate.

The homework could wait.

It had to.

Marcus slipped back into the garage, closing the door softly behind him, and let the darkness swallow him whole.

**Scene 2: At school, Marcus avoids Jade'...**

**Scene 2: At school, Marcus avoids Jade's attempts to talk to him**

The fluorescent lights in the hallway buzzed overhead, casting everything in a sickly yellow glow that made Marcus's head ache. Or maybe that was just the exhaustion. He'd been up until two in the morning trying to clean Bruno's latest mess—the cub had somehow knocked over an entire shelf of his dad's old paint cans, and the garage floor was now streaked with dried hunter green.

Marcus slammed his locker shut and turned to find Jade standing three feet away, her arms crossed over her chest.

"Hey, stranger," she said, her voice carrying an edge he wasn't used to hearing from her. "Remember me? Your best friend?"

Marcus's stomach twisted. The purple streaks in Jade's hair caught the light as she tilted her head, waiting for an answer he couldn't give.

"Hey, yeah, sorry. I've just been—" He shifted his backpack higher on his shoulder, a movement that made the scratches on his arm sting beneath his hoodie. He'd worn long sleeves even though the school's heating system was cranked up high enough to turn the hallways into a sauna. "Really busy."

"Busy." Jade repeated the word like it tasted bad. "Marcus, you haven't answered any of my texts in three days. You disappeared during lunch yesterday. And last week you literally ran away from me in the parking lot."

"I wasn't running, I just—I had to get home."

"For what?"

The question hung between them. Marcus could smell the chemical tang of floor cleaner where the janitor had mopped that morning. A group of freshmen pushed past them, their laughter echoing off the tile walls. One of them bumped Marcus's shoulder, and he winced as pain shot down his injured arm.

"I just have a lot going on right now," Marcus said finally, hating how weak it sounded.

Jade's expression softened slightly. She stepped closer, lowering her voice. "Is it your mom? Is she okay?"

"What? No, Mom's fine. She's just working a lot." That part was true, at least. His mother's double shifts at the hospital meant she left before dawn and came home after dark, too exhausted to notice that her son was slowly unraveling.

"Then what is it?" Jade's brown eyes searched his face. "Marcus, you look terrible. When's the last time you slept? And why are you wearing a hoodie when it's like eighty degrees in here?"

"I'm fine."

"You're not fine. Talk to me. Please."

The concern in her voice made something crack inside his chest. For a wild moment, Marcus almost told her everything—about the cub in the garage, about the way Bruno's eyes lit up when Marcus came home, about the terror of keeping this impossible secret. The words climbed up his throat.

But then he imagined saying it out loud. Imagined the look on Jade's face. Imagined her telling him he was crazy, telling him he had to call someone, telling him he had to give Bruno up.

"I really have to get to class," Marcus said, and started walking.

"Marcus—"

He didn't turn around. He could feel Jade's stare burning into his back as he pushed through the crowded hallway, weaving between clusters of students. His heart hammered against his ribs. Behind him, he heard Jade call his name one more time, but he kept walking, faster now, until he rounded the corner and she was out of sight.

The hurt in her voice followed him all the way to Mr. Chen's math class.

---

Marcus slid into his seat just as the bell rang. The classroom smelled like dry-erase markers and the stale air from the ancient heating vents. Mr. Chen was already at the front of the room, sorting through a stack of papers with the grim expression of someone about to deliver bad news.

"Tests from last week," Mr. Chen announced. "Some of you did well. Some of you..." He let the sentence trail off meaningfully.

Marcus's stomach dropped. The test. He'd completely forgotten about the test. Or no, that wasn't quite right—he remembered sitting in this very seat, staring at the equations on the page, but his mind had been miles away. He'd been calculating how many cans of tuna he had left at home, wondering if Bruno would eat canned vegetables, trying to remember if bears needed vitamins.

Mr. Chen moved through the rows, placing tests face-down on desks. Some students flipped theirs over immediately with confident grins. Others touched the corners gingerly, like the papers might bite.

When Mr. Chen reached Marcus's desk, he paused. He set the test down slowly, and Marcus caught a glimpse of red ink bleeding across the top of the page.

"See me after class, Marcus," Mr. Chen said quietly.

Marcus nodded without looking up. His face felt hot.

After Mr. Chen moved on, Marcus lifted the edge of the paper. A giant red F stared back at him, circled twice for emphasis. Below it, Mr. Chen had written: *Did you even study? This is not like you.*

Marcus let the paper fall flat and stared at the equations he'd left blank or answered incorrectly. The numbers swam before his eyes. Around him, Mr. Chen was starting the lesson on quadratic functions, but the words washed over Marcus like static.

All he could think about was Bruno, probably awake by now in the garage, wondering where Marcus was. Had he knocked over the water bowl again? Was he hungry? What if he started making noise and one of the neighbors heard?

Marcus's phone buzzed in his pocket—a violation of school rules, but he'd forgotten to silence it. He pulled it out just enough to see the screen. A text from his mom: *Working late again. Leftovers in fridge. Love you.*

Relief and guilt warred in his chest. Another night alone meant another night he could spend with Bruno without questions. But it also meant another night of lying, another night of this crushing weight pressing down on him.

"Marcus?" Mr. Chen's voice cut through his thoughts. "Can you solve this one?"

Marcus looked up at the whiteboard, where an equation sprawled across the surface in blue marker. He had no idea what the question was, let alone the answer.

"I... um..."

"The quadratic formula," Mr. Chen prompted, not unkindly. "We just went over it."

Several students turned to look at Marcus. He felt their eyes on him, felt the heat rising in his cheeks again. His arm throbbed where Bruno's claws had opened the skin.

"I don't know," Marcus admitted.

Mr. Chen sighed. "Pay attention, please."

The rest of the class crawled by. Marcus tried to focus, tried to copy down the notes on the board, but his handwriting looked shaky and strange. His mind kept drifting back to the garage, to Jade's hurt expression in the hallway, to the growing list of lies he was juggling.

When the bell finally rang, Marcus gathered his things slowly while the other students filed out. Mr. Chen erased the whiteboard in long, deliberate strokes.

"Marcus," he said without turning around. "What's going on with you?"

"Nothing, I just—"

"You're one of my best students. Or you were." Mr. Chen turned to face him, chalk dust on his hands. "This F isn't an isolated incident. You've missed three homework assignments in the past two weeks. You're falling asleep in class. And today you looked like you were a million miles away."

Marcus gripped the strap of his backpack. "I'm sorry. I'll do better."

"Is something happening at home? You can talk to me, you know. Or we can get you in to see the counselor."

"No, really, everything's fine. I just got behind. I'll catch up."

Mr. Chen studied him for a long moment, and Marcus forced himself to meet his teacher's eyes, to keep his expression neutral and calm even though his heart was racing.

Finally, Mr. Chen nodded. "All right. But Marcus—I'm here if you need help. With math or anything else. Okay?"

"Okay. Thank you."

Marcus escaped into the hallway, which had mostly cleared out as students headed to their next classes. He walked quickly, head down, not wanting to run into anyone else who might ask questions he couldn't answer.

He made it almost to the science wing before he saw Jade again.

She was standing by the water fountain, clearly waiting for him. When their eyes met, Marcus's first instinct was to turn around and go the other way. But something in Jade's expression stopped him—not anger, but something sadder and more determined.

She pushed off the wall and started walking

**Scene 3: During an energetic play sessi...**

**Scene 3: During an energetic play session in the garage, Bruno accidentally scratches Marcus's arm**

The garage smelled different now—musky and wild, with undertones of damp earth and something Marcus couldn't quite name. He'd spread old blankets across the concrete floor, creating a makeshift den in the corner where Bruno spent most of his time sleeping or gnawing on the increasingly inadequate supply of dog toys Marcus had bought with his saved allowance.

"Hey, buddy," Marcus whispered, slipping through the side door and clicking it shut behind him. He'd taken to entering through the back entrance, away from the house's main windows. "Miss me?"

Bruno's ears perked up immediately. The cub had doubled in size over the past two weeks, his legs longer and sturdier, his shoulders beginning to show the powerful muscle that would one day make him formidable. He scrambled to his feet, letting out a huffing sound that was somewhere between a grunt and a whine.

Marcus dropped his backpack—homework still undone, math test unstudied for—and knelt on the blankets. Bruno bounded over, all enthusiasm and uncoordinated energy, his paws thudding against the concrete. The impact of his weight nearly knocked Marcus backward.

"Whoa, you're getting strong!" Marcus laughed, wrapping his arms around the cub's thick neck. Bruno's fur was coarser now, less downy, and Marcus could feel the solid warmth of him, the rapid heartbeat beneath his ribs.

They wrestled the way they had every afternoon for weeks, Marcus rolling Bruno onto his back, the cub play-biting at his hands with teeth that were no longer harmless nubs. There was a moment—just a flash—when Marcus noticed how much pressure those jaws could apply, how his fingers ached after Bruno clamped down, even gently.

"Easy, easy," Marcus said, pulling his hand free and ruffling the fur on Bruno's head.

Bruno rolled upright and lunged playfully, his front paws reaching for Marcus's shoulders. It was a game they'd played a hundred times. Marcus would catch those paws, they'd grapple for a moment, and then Marcus would gently push the cub away.

Except this time, Bruno's momentum was too much.

The cub's weight drove Marcus backward, and as Marcus tried to catch himself, Bruno's right paw came down hard on his forearm. Marcus felt the claws—sharp as fishing hooks, longer than he'd realized—drag across his skin.

The pain was immediate and shocking.

"Ah!" Marcus gasped, jerking his arm away.

Bruno stumbled back, confused by the sudden movement, by the sharp sound Marcus had made. The cub's ears flattened against his head.

Marcus cradled his arm against his chest, feeling the hot pulse of blood before he saw it. When he looked down, four parallel lines ran from just below his elbow nearly to his wrist, deep enough that blood was already soaking through his sleeve, spreading in dark blooms across the gray fabric.

"Oh god," Marcus breathed. The garage tilted slightly, his vision swimming.

Bruno approached cautiously, nose extended, making a small worried sound in his throat.

"It's okay," Marcus said automatically, though his voice shook. "It's okay, you didn't mean it."

But his hands were trembling as he peeled back his sleeve. The scratches were worse than he'd thought—angry red gouges, the deepest one still welling blood. He could see the white of tissue beneath.

Bruno pushed his muzzle against Marcus's knee, whimpering.

"I know, I know," Marcus whispered. "Not your fault, buddy. You were just playing."

He stumbled to his feet, dizzy, and made his way to the old utility sink in the corner. The water ran cold over the wounds, stinging so badly he had to bite his lip to keep from crying out. Pink water swirled down the drain. Behind him, he could hear Bruno pacing, agitated.

Marcus found an ancient first aid kit on a shelf—left over from when his dad actually used the garage for projects—and managed to wrap gauze around his forearm with his shaking left hand. The white fabric turned red almost immediately in spots, but the pressure helped. He added more layers, then secured it with medical tape.

His whole arm throbbed in time with his heartbeat.

When he turned around, Bruno was sitting in the middle of the garage, looking smaller somehow, his eyes fixed on Marcus with an expression that seemed almost human in its worry.

Marcus crossed back to him and sank down onto the blankets. "Hey," he said softly. "It's not your fault. You hear me? You're just being a bear. That's what bears do."

Bruno crawled forward and rested his heavy head on Marcus's lap. Marcus stroked the fur between his ears with his good hand, feeling the cub's body relax slightly.

*You're just being a bear.*

The words echoed in Marcus's mind, and for the first time, they didn't sound comforting. They sounded like a warning he'd been ignoring.

Bruno was getting bigger. Stronger. Wilder. The garage that had seemed spacious enough two weeks ago now felt cramped, the cub's restless energy filling every corner. And Marcus—Marcus was just a fifteen-year-old kid who didn't know the first thing about raising a bear.

He looked down at his bandaged arm, at the blood already seeping through the layers of gauze.

"What am I doing?" he whispered.

Bruno made a soft chuffing sound and pressed closer, seeking comfort the way he always did. The cub trusted him completely. Depended on him.

Marcus squeezed his eyes shut. He couldn't think about this now. Couldn't face what it meant. Instead, he wrapped his good arm around Bruno and held on, ignoring the pain radiating up his injured arm, ignoring the voice in his head that was starting to sound like fear.

Tomorrow. He'd figure it out tomorrow.

For now, he just held his bear and pretended everything was fine, even as his blood soaked through the bandages and his heart hammered with something that felt dangerously close to panic.

**Scene 4: Unable to sleep due to his thr...**

**Scene 4: Unable to sleep due to his throbbing arm, Marcus lies in bed remembering his grandmother's abandoned farmhouse**

Marcus stared at the ceiling, tracing the familiar crack that split the plaster like a lightning bolt frozen in time. His arm pulsed with each heartbeat, a steady throb that radiated from beneath the bandages he'd wrapped around the scratches. Three angry lines, deep enough that he'd had to stuff toilet paper against them until the bleeding stopped.

He shifted position, trying to find relief that wouldn't come. The digital clock on his nightstand glowed 2:47 AM in accusatory red numbers.

*Bruno didn't mean it,* he told himself for the hundredth time. *He was just playing. He doesn't know his own strength yet.*

But the pain said otherwise.

Marcus rolled onto his side, wincing as his sleeve brushed the wounds, and his gaze fell on the framed photo on his dresser. His grandmother's farmhouse, taken the summer before she died. He could barely make out the details in the darkness, but he didn't need light to see it—the image was burned into his memory. White clapboard siding, a sagging porch, windows like sleepy eyes looking out over acres of overgrown fields. Behind it, a wall of trees that stretched back into wilderness.

His chest tightened with sudden longing.

The house had been sitting empty for two years now. His mom kept saying they needed to sell it, but she never got around to listing it. Too many memories, she'd said once, her voice going soft and distant. Too hard to let go.

Marcus sat up, ignoring the fresh wave of pain from his arm. His laptop sat on his desk, and before he could second-guess himself, he was opening it, the screen's glow painting his face blue-white in the darkness.

He typed the address into Google Maps, zooming in on the satellite view. There it was—the farmhouse a small rectangle surrounded by green. The nearest neighbor was half a mile away. The woods behind the property went on for miles, eventually connecting to state forest land.

Perfect.

His fingers flew across the keyboard, opening new tabs. *Living off the grid.* *Homesteading for beginners.* *What do black bears eat in the wild.*

The more he researched, the more the fantasy took shape in his mind. He could see it so clearly: Bruno lumbering through the tall grass, fishing in the creek that ran along the property's eastern edge. The two of them living in peaceful isolation, no one to hide from, no lies to tell. Marcus would hunt and forage—well, he'd learn how to hunt and forage. There had to be tutorials for that. He'd homeschool himself, maybe. Or just… not worry about school at all.

At 3:30 AM, he pulled his duffel bag from the closet, moving as quietly as possible. His parents' bedroom was down the hall, and his mom was a light sleeper.

What would he need? Marcus grabbed clothes first—jeans, t-shirts, his warmest hoodie. His hands shook slightly as he folded them, adrenaline mixing with exhaustion. He added a flashlight, his pocketknife, the emergency cash from his desk drawer. Forty-three dollars. Not much, but it was something.

He paused, holding one of his grandmother's quilts that she'd made him when he was little. Bears and pine trees stitched in faded blues and greens. He pressed it to his face, breathing in the ghost of her lavender sachets, and felt tears prick his eyes.

"I'm sorry, Grandma," he whispered. "But I don't know what else to do."

The quilt went into the bag.

His phone buzzed on the nightstand—probably another text from Jade that he wouldn't answer. He ignored it, returning to his laptop. Google Maps again, this time looking at routes. Three hours by car, but he couldn't drive. The bus, maybe? He'd have to figure out how to get Bruno there. A crate in a taxi? No, too expensive, and too many questions.

Details. He'd work out the details.

Marcus pulled up images of the farmhouse, zooming in on each one. The kitchen where Grandma had taught him to make pie crust. The porch where they'd shelled peas on summer evenings. The barn—half-collapsed now, but still standing. Bruno could sleep there. Bears liked dens, didn't they? Enclosed spaces where they felt safe.

He could make this work. He *had* to make this work.

By 4:15 AM, his eyes were burning, but sleep felt impossible. The bag sat under his bed now, hidden but ready. On his screen, a satellite image of the farmhouse glowed like a beacon, like a promise.

Like an escape route from a trap that was closing tighter every day.

Marcus touched his bandaged arm gently, feeling the raised edges of the scratches through the gauze. Tomorrow he'd need to wear long sleeves again, even though the forecast called for eighty degrees. Tomorrow Jade would probably corner him again, demanding answers he couldn't give. Tomorrow his English teacher would ask about the essay he hadn't written.

But maybe there wouldn't be a tomorrow. Not here, anyway.

Maybe tomorrow he'd be gone.

The thought should have scared him. Instead, it filled him with something that felt dangerously close to hope.

**Scene 5: At school, Jade notices blood ...**

The cafeteria smelled like industrial-strength disinfectant and reheated pizza. Marcus sat alone at the far end of a table near the windows, pushing tater tots around his tray with a plastic fork. He'd chosen this spot deliberately—away from the main cluster of tables, away from conversations he'd have to pretend to care about, away from Jade.

But Jade had other plans.

"You're bleeding."

Marcus's head snapped up. She stood across from him, lunch tray balanced on one hip, her dark eyes fixed on his left arm. He followed her gaze and felt his stomach drop. A crimson stain had bloomed through the gray fabric of his hoodie sleeve, small but unmistakable against the worn cotton.

"It's nothing." He pulled his arm against his body, hiding it from view.

"That's not nothing, Marcus." Jade set her tray down with a decisive clatter and slid into the seat across from him. "How long have you been bleeding?"

"I'm fine. Just leave it alone."

"No." The single word was quiet but absolute. "I'm not leaving it alone, and I'm not leaving you alone."

Marcus grabbed his tray and stood abruptly, the metal legs of his chair screeching against the linoleum. Around them, a few heads turned, then lost interest. "I have to go."

He made it three steps before Jade was in front of him, moving faster than he'd anticipated. She didn't touch him, but she stood squarely in his path, arms crossed, blocking the way to the cafeteria doors.

"Move, Jade."

"No."

"I'm serious. Get out of my way."

"So am I." Her voice remained steady, but he could see the hurt flickering in her eyes. "You've been avoiding me for weeks. You look like you haven't slept in days. Your grades are tanking—don't think I haven't noticed Ms. Chen calling you out in English. And now you're literally bleeding through your clothes and pretending it's fine."

"It's not your problem." The words came out harsher than he intended, and he saw her flinch.

"You're my friend. That makes it my problem."

"We're not—" He stopped himself, but the damage was already done. The words hung between them like smoke.

Jade's expression hardened, but her eyes were bright with unshed tears. "We're not what? Friends? Because last I checked, friends don't just disappear. Friends don't ignore texts for three weeks straight. Friends don't lie about everything."

"You don't understand."

"Then help me understand!" Her voice rose, drawing more attention now. She lowered it again, leaning closer. "Whatever is going on with you, Marcus, you don't have to handle it alone. You don't have to shut everyone out."

Marcus felt something crack inside his chest—a dam he'd been reinforcing brick by brick since the day he'd found Bruno. The weight of the secret pressed down on him, suffocating. He could feel the ache in his arm where Bruno's claws had torn through skin, could smell the lingering scent of the garage on his clothes despite washing them twice. He was so tired. Tired of lying, tired of sneaking, tired of carrying this alone.

"I can't tell you." His voice broke on the last word.

Jade's expression softened. She took a small step closer, her voice dropping to barely above a whisper. "Real friends don't abandon each other when things get hard, Marcus. Not you. Not me. Whatever this is—whatever you're hiding—it's eating you alive. I can see it."

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead. Someone laughed too loud at a nearby table. The smell of marinara sauce mixed with the chemical tang of cleaning products. Marcus stood there, tray still in his hands, feeling the blood seep warm and sticky against his forearm.

He thought of Bruno, probably awake by now in the darkened garage, confused about why Marcus hadn't come to feed him before school. He thought of the packed duffel bag hidden under his bed, the fantasy of escape to his grandmother's farmhouse already feeling hollow and impossible. He thought of the scratch marks hidden beneath his sleeve, and the way Bruno had looked at him afterward—not guilty, just curious, because Bruno was still just a cub who didn't understand his own strength.

"If I tell you," he said quietly, "everything changes."

"Everything's already changed," Jade replied. "You just won't let me in to see it."

Marcus looked at her—really looked at her—for the first time in weeks. At the concern etched in her features, the stubborn set of her jaw, the way she stood her ground even though he'd given her every reason to walk away. She was right. She'd always been right.

He set his tray down on the nearest table.

"Not here," he said. "Come with me."

Jade grabbed her backpack without hesitation. "Okay."

They walked out of the cafeteria together, Marcus's sleeve growing darker with blood, Jade matching his stride. The hallway stretched before them, empty and echoing. Marcus's heart hammered against his ribs. In a few minutes, he would tell her everything. In a few minutes, the secret that had been consuming him would finally have a witness.

He didn't know if that terrified him or relieved him.

Maybe both.

**Scene 6: Marcus finally confesses every...**

**Scene 6: Marcus finally confesses everything to Jade**

The classroom smelled of dry-erase markers and old textbooks. Afternoon sunlight slanted through the dusty windows, cutting golden rectangles across the empty desks. Marcus sat in the back corner, his backpack—the one he'd packed for running away—heavy at his feet like an anchor.

Jade stood in the doorway, her arms crossed, her expression unreadable.

"You can't keep avoiding me forever," she said quietly. "This school's not that big."

Marcus stared at his hands. The bandage he'd wrapped around his forearm that morning was already showing a small red bloom where the deepest scratch had reopened. He'd been so careful pulling on his hoodie, but careful didn't matter anymore. Nothing he did mattered.

"I'm not—"

"Marcus." Jade's voice cracked like ice. "I saw the blood. During chemistry. It was soaking through your sleeve."

He pulled his arm closer to his body instinctively, and the movement made him wince. The scratches burned, deep and angry. He could still feel Bruno's weight on his chest from this morning, those innocent eyes staring down at him, tongue lolling. The cub didn't mean to hurt him. Bruno didn't understand his own strength anymore, didn't know his claws could tear skin like paper.

Jade moved closer, her sneakers squeaking on the linoleum. She pulled out the chair beside him and sat down, not touching him, just waiting.

The silence stretched between them like a tightrope. Marcus felt something crack inside his chest—a dam he'd been shoring up with lies and excuses and sleepless nights. His throat tightened.

"I found a bear," he whispered.

Jade blinked. "What?"

"A bear cub. In the woods behind my house. His mother was dead, and he was alone, and I—" Marcus's voice broke. "I couldn't just leave him there."

The words tumbled out then, faster and faster, like water through a broken levee. He told her about the cardboard box and the garage, about stealing food from the kitchen and lying to his mom about homework. He told her about Bruno's soft fur and the way he curled against Marcus's side, about the nights spent sleeping on the cold concrete floor because the cub cried when Marcus left. He told her about the scratches, about how big Bruno was getting, about the fantasy of his grandmother's farmhouse and the bag at his feet packed with everything he owned.

"I was going to leave tonight," Marcus said, his voice hollow. "Just take him and go. Start over somewhere he could be free and I could—" He stopped, swallowing hard. "I could be someone who matters. Someone important to something."

Tears burned hot tracks down his face. He didn't try to stop them.

Jade sat perfectly still, her dark eyes wide. When she finally spoke, her voice was gentle. "Marcus, you matter to me. You know that, right?"

"It's not the same." He wiped his face roughly with his good arm. "You don't need me. Bruno does. Without me, he'd die."

"That's not true." Jade pulled out her phone, her fingers moving quickly across the screen. "I mean, it was true. When you found him. But not anymore."

She turned the phone toward him. The screen showed an article about orphaned wildlife, filled with pictures of bear cubs in rehabilitation centers. She scrolled slowly, showing him images of veterinarians bottle-feeding cubs, of cubs playing together in large outdoor enclosures, of healthy bears being released back into the wild.

"Bear cubs need special nutrition," Jade read quietly. "They need medical care, vaccinations. They need to learn to forage and hunt from experienced handlers. And they need other bears, Marcus. For socialization. So they can eventually survive in the wild."

Marcus stared at the pictures. In one, three cubs tumbled over each other in what looked like supervised play. They looked healthy. Happy. Nothing like Bruno, who spent his days pacing the garage, pawing at the door, crying those terrible sounds that made Marcus's heart ache.

"I'm giving him all of that," Marcus said, but the words felt thin even as he spoke them. "I feed him. I play with him. I—"

"You're feeding him table scraps and dog food," Jade said, not unkindly. "And he hurt you, Marcus. He didn't mean to, but he did. He's going to keep growing. What happens in a month? Two months? What happens when he's too big for the garage? When he's too strong for you to control?"

Marcus thought of Bruno's teeth, already sharp, already capable of tearing through the leather work gloves he'd tried using during playtime. He thought of the way the cub had started testing the garage door, pushing against it with increasing force. He thought of his mother, who would eventually discover the truth. Who would call animal control. Who would have Bruno destroyed because Marcus had been too selfish to do the right thing.

"I don't want to lose him," Marcus whispered. The admission felt like pulling glass from a wound. "He's the only thing that makes me feel like I'm not invisible. Like I'm not just... nothing."

Jade set her phone down and finally reached out, her hand hovering near his shoulder before settling there with gentle pressure. "You're not nothing. You're the person who saved a bear cub's life. You're the person who cared enough to try, even when it was hard. Even when it meant lying and hiding and getting hurt."

She squeezed his shoulder softly. "But keeping Bruno now? That's not saving him anymore. That's keeping him from the life he deserves. From the life he needs."

Marcus closed his eyes. Behind his eyelids, he saw Bruno—not as he was now, cramped and restless in the dim garage, but as he could be. Running through forests, catching fish in streams, growing strong and wild and free. Living the life a bear was meant to live.

The pain in his chest deepened, sharp and terrible and true.

"I don't know how to let him go," Marcus said.

Jade pulled up another webpage, this one for a wildlife rehabilitation center two hours north. "You don't have to do it alone," she said. "I'll help you. We'll figure it out together."

Through the window, the sun was sinking lower, painting the classroom in shades of amber and gold. Marcus thought of Bruno waiting in the garage, probably hungry, probably confused about why Marcus hadn't come home yet. His throat ached with unshed tears.

But for the first time in weeks, the crushing weight on his chest felt lighter. Just a little. Just enough to breathe.

"Okay," he whispered. "Okay."
