## Chapter 1 Review: "Hog Wild: A Graceland Pig Tale"

1. **Internal Consistency**
    * Issue: Scene 2 mentions Old Bess choking on an apple core. Scene 1 mentions Percy enjoying fermented apples sometimes in his slop. This creates a contradiction, as the farmer would likely avoid feeding apples to pigs if they were known to be a choking hazard.
    * Issue: In scene 3, the lyrics from Hound Dog are nonsensical and make Percy feel a strange pull. Later, in scene 4, Percy sings the song perfectly, indicating understanding of the lyrics and feeling. This is inconsistent with his initial confusion.

2. **Clarity**
    * No issues found.

3. **Plot Holes**
    * Issue: In Scene 2, it is stated that the radio looks like it has no purpose and just sits there. It seems odd that it has been in the pigpen so long but the farmer or other farmhands have not removed it, especially since it is supposedly in the pigpen with the pig.
    * Issue: In Scene 4, it is stated that hens are unflappable creatures. This is an opinion and cannot be proved or disproved.

4. **Redundancy**
    * Issue: The description of the pigpen's smell is repeated throughout the chapter (manure, stale feed, etc.).
    * Issue: Percy's feeling of being different and destined for something more is stated multiple times.

5. **Flow and Transitions**
    * Issue: The chapter is broken into scenes, but scenes 2-5 have abrupt starts.

6. **Actionable Fixes**

    1.  In Scene 1, replace the reference to fermented apples with a different treat that avoids the choking hazard contradiction, such as overripe melons or discarded sweet corn cobs.
    2.  In Scene 3, revise the sentence about the lyrics of Hound Dog to acknowledge his lack of understanding, maybe adding "He didn't fully comprehend the words, but the energy resonated with him."
    3. In Scene 4, remove or alter the section to describe the pigs singing Hound Dog perfectly, and make Percy sing the song imperfectly.
    4.  Consolidate descriptions of the pigpen's smell, reducing repetition.
    5.  Reduce the frequency with which Percy's feeling of being different and destined for more is mentioned. Instead, show this through his actions and thoughts.
    6.  Add transitional sentences or paragraphs between scenes 2-5 to improve flow. For example, add a sentence or two at the end of Scene 1 hinting at Percy's growing curiosity and his intent to explore the barn further, thus smoothly leading into Scene 2.
    7. In scene 2, include that the farmer has been in the hospital, and that is why the radio is still there and not taken away.
    8. Remove the statement that hens are unflappable creatures in scene 4.
