## Chapter 2: A Language Without Words

**Scene 1: Marcus observes from the doorway**

Marcus froze halfway down the stairs, his hand gripping the banister.

The sound coming from the living room wasn't music or television—it was something he hadn't heard in so long he almost didn't recognize it. A soft, rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of something bouncing across the hardwood floor, followed by the skitter of paws.

He descended the last few steps slowly, carefully, the way you might approach a wild animal you didn't want to startle. The late afternoon sun slanted through the living room windows, turning the dust motes into tiny galaxies of light. The golden beams illuminated Jamie sitting cross-legged on the floor in his oversized gray hoodie, the one he'd been wearing almost every day since—

Marcus pushed the thought away.

Jamie rolled a red rubber ball across the floor.

Whiskers crouched low, his mismatched eyes—one blue, one green—locked on the ball with laser focus. His hindquarters wiggled, tail swishing back and forth like a dog's. Then he pounced, racing after the ball with an enthusiasm Marcus had never seen in any cat. The animal snatched the ball in his mouth and trotted back to Jamie, dropping it at his feet.

Just like a dog.

Jamie's hand reached out, fingers brushing over Whiskers' orange and white fur. The cat leaned into the touch, purring loud enough for Marcus to hear from the doorway. Then Jamie picked up the ball and rolled it again, this time toward the couch.

Whiskers bolted after it.

And Jamie's shoulders began to shake.

Marcus's breath caught in his throat. For one horrible second, he thought his brother was crying—that this small moment of normalcy had somehow broken him. But then he saw it: the way Jamie's hand came up to cover his mouth, the way his eyes crinkled at the corners, the way his whole body curved forward.

Jamie was laughing.

No sound came out—it was silent, the way all of Jamie's expressions had been for six months—but it was unmistakably laughter. Real, genuine joy.

Whiskers returned with the ball, but this time he didn't drop it. He sat in front of Jamie, ball clamped in his jaws, tail swishing across the floor. Waiting.

Jamie tugged gently on the ball. Whiskers held firm, a playful glint in his strange eyes. They engaged in a brief tug-of-war, and Jamie's shoulders shook harder with silent giggles. Finally, Whiskers released the ball, and Jamie immediately threw it—not rolled it this time, but actually threw it—toward the hallway.

The cat scrambled after it, claws clicking on the hardwood, and disappeared around the corner.

Marcus realized he was holding his breath. He let it out slowly, afraid that even the smallest sound might shatter whatever magic was happening in this room. The house felt different somehow—lighter, as if a window had been cracked open after months of stale air.

Whiskers came bounding back, ball in mouth, and dropped it at Jamie's feet with an expectant *mrrp* sound. Not a meow—something between a bark and a trill.

Jamie picked up the ball again, and for just a moment, he looked up.

His eyes met Marcus's across the room.

Marcus's heart stuttered. He braced himself for Jamie to shut down, to retreat back into that unreachable place where he'd been living. But Jamie didn't look away. He didn't smile, exactly—that would have been too much, too soon. But something in his expression softened, just a fraction. An acknowledgment. *I see you seeing me.*

Then Jamie turned back to Whiskers and rolled the ball again.

Marcus stayed in the doorway, not daring to move closer, not wanting to become part of the moment and risk disrupting it. He just watched as his little brother played with the cat who barked, both of them strange and broken and somehow finding each other in their brokenness.

Outside, the sun continued its descent, stretching the shadows across the living room floor. Upstairs, Marcus could hear his mother moving around in her bedroom—probably folding laundry, staying busy the way she always did now. The refrigerator hummed in the kitchen. The world kept turning, indifferent and relentless.

But here, in this small pocket of golden light, something had shifted.

Whiskers retrieved the ball one more time, but instead of dropping it, he climbed into Jamie's lap, ball still in his mouth, and began to knead Jamie's legs with his paws. Purring. Jamie's hand came down to rest on the cat's back, fingers disappearing into the orange and white fur.

Marcus backed away from the doorway, letting them have their moment. As he climbed the stairs to his room, he felt something unfamiliar blooming in his chest—something fragile and tentative that he was afraid to name.

It felt dangerously close to hope.

**Scene 2: During dinner, Marcus's mother...**

The kitchen smelled like burnt garlic bread—again. Marcus poked at the lasagna on his plate, watching the cheese congeal into orange rubber as his mother set down the salad bowl with more force than necessary. The overhead light buzzed, that annoying flicker that Dad had always meant to fix, casting uneven shadows across the scratched wooden table.

Jamie sat across from Marcus, methodically separating his food into distinct piles: pasta in one corner, meat in another, vegetables pushed to the plate's edge. Whiskers sat beneath Jamie's chair, tail wrapped around his paws, waiting with the patience of a dog who knew treats would come.

"He's been spending a lot of time with that cat," Mom said, not quite looking at either of them as she served herself salad. Her voice had that careful quality it always got when she was really talking about something else.

Marcus swallowed a too-hot bite of lasagna. "Yeah. It's good, right? He's been more... active."

"Active." His mother repeated the word like she was testing its weight. She finally looked up, and Marcus saw the purple shadows beneath her eyes, darker than they'd been last week. "He plays with it for hours, Marcus. Yesterday I found him in the garage at ten at night, throwing that tennis ball."

"He's playing, Mom. Isn't that what Dr. Reeves wanted? Engagement?"

Jamie's fork scraped against his plate. He didn't look up, but his shoulders had gone rigid.

Mom set down her fork with a soft clink. "Of course. I just..." She pressed her fingers to her temple, where Marcus knew she got headaches now. "I worry about him getting too attached. It's just a stray, honey. We don't know where it came from, if it has a home, if someone's looking for it."

"Nobody's looking for him." Marcus surprised himself with the sharpness in his voice. "He's been here for weeks."

"Exactly. Weeks." His mother's hands were back on her fork, gripping it too tightly. "And in three weeks, Jamie has his evaluation. For Pinewood."

The name hung in the air like smoke. Pinewood Residential Treatment Center. Marcus had looked it up online—a place two hours away where kids went when regular therapy wasn't enough. Where they lived, away from their families, for months at a time.

Jamie's fork clattered to his plate.

"It's just an evaluation, sweetheart," Mom said quickly, reaching toward Jamie. He pulled his hands into his lap before she could touch him. "Just to see what our options are. Dr. Reeves thinks it might be good to explore—"

Jamie pushed back from the table, chair legs shrieking against the linoleum. Whiskers immediately stood, following Jamie's movement with alert eyes.

"Jamie, please sit down. We need to—"

But Jamie was already gone, footsteps pounding up the stairs. A moment later, his bedroom door slammed hard enough to rattle the dishes in the cabinet.

Whiskers remained in the kitchen, looking between Marcus and his mother. Then the cat did something Marcus had never seen a cat do: he whined, a soft, plaintive sound exactly like a worried dog.

Mom's face crumpled for just a second before she caught herself, smoothing her expression back into tired determination. "I'm not the bad guy here, Marcus. I'm trying to help him."

"I know." And he did know. He could see it in the way her hands trembled slightly as she picked up her fork again, in the worry lines that had carved themselves permanently between her eyebrows. "But maybe Whiskers is helping him too."

"A cat can't replace therapy, Marcus."

"I'm not saying it can. I'm just saying..." He searched for the right words. "Maybe we should see where this goes. Before we send him away."

"It's not sending him away. It's getting him help."

"For three to six months. Two hours away."

His mother stood abruptly, gathering plates even though no one had finished eating. "You think I want this? You think I want to put my twelve-year-old son in a residential program?" Her voice cracked on the last word. "But he hasn't spoken in six months, Marcus. Six months. And every doctor, every therapist, they all say the same thing. He needs more intensive—"

"He spoke to the cat."

The words were out before Marcus could stop them.

Mom froze, a plate in each hand. "What?"

Marcus's heart hammered. He'd promised himself he wouldn't say anything, wouldn't jinx it. But the thought of Jamie being sent away, of Whiskers being gone...

"I heard him. A few days ago. Whispering to Whiskers. Trying to teach him commands." Marcus met his mother's eyes. "He was using words, Mom. Real words."

The plates clinked as she set them in the sink. She gripped the counter's edge, her back to Marcus.

"How many words?" Her voice was barely audible.

"I don't know. A few. 'Sit.' 'Stay.' Quiet, but clear."

"And you didn't tell me."

It wasn't a question, but Marcus answered anyway. "I was afraid if we made a big deal out of it, he'd stop."

Mom turned around slowly. Her eyes were wet, but no tears fell. "The evaluation is in three weeks, Marcus. Three weeks. If he's really talking..." She swallowed hard. "I need to know. Dr. Reeves needs to know."

Upstairs, a door opened. Footsteps crossed the hallway—Jamie's room to the bathroom. Through it all, Whiskers sat perfectly still in the kitchen doorway, ears swiveled toward the sounds above, keeping watch.

"Just give it time," Marcus said. "Please."

His mother looked at Whiskers, then at the ceiling, then back at Marcus. When she spoke, her voice carried the weight of every impossible decision she'd had to make since Dad died.

"Three weeks. That's all the time we have."

**Scene 3: Marcus is doing homework in hi...**

**Scene 3: Marcus is doing homework in his room when he hears a faint sound**

The calculus problem blurred before Marcus's eyes. He'd been staring at the same equation for ten minutes, his pencil tapping an irregular rhythm against his textbook. Outside his window, the November sky had deepened to indigo, and the streetlights cast orange pools on the wet pavement below.

He rubbed his eyes and tried again. *If train A leaves the station at—*

A sound stopped him mid-thought.

Marcus's pencil froze above the page. He held his breath, straining to hear past the hum of the refrigerator downstairs, past the distant murmur of the television where his mom was watching something she probably wasn't really seeing.

There. Again.

A voice. Thin as spider silk. Coming from Jamie's room.

Marcus's heart kicked against his ribs. He pushed back from his desk slowly, carefully, as if sudden movement might shatter whatever fragile thing was happening across the hall. The hardwood floor creaked under his socks as he crossed to his doorway.

Jamie's door stood half-open, spilling a wedge of lamplight into the hallway. Marcus pressed himself against the wall, just outside the light's reach, and listened.

"Sit."

The word was barely there—less than a whisper, more like the ghost of a whisper. But it was real. It was Jamie's voice, rusty and uncertain, but *his*.

Marcus's throat tightened. Six months. It had been six months since he'd heard his brother speak.

"Sit," Jamie said again, a fraction louder this time.

Through the gap in the door, Marcus could see a slice of Jamie's room: the corner of his bed with its rumpled blue comforter, a stack of comic books on the nightstand that hadn't been touched since April, and Jamie himself, cross-legged on the floor in his oversized hoodie.

Whiskers sat before him, tail curled around his paws, head cocked at an angle that seemed almost canine in its attentiveness.

"Good," Jamie breathed. "Good boy."

Marcus pressed his hand over his mouth. His eyes burned. He wanted to laugh, to cry, to run downstairs and grab his mother, to burst into Jamie's room and wrap his brother in a hug that might crack both their ribs.

He did none of those things.

Instead, he stayed frozen in the hallway, barely breathing, as Jamie continued.

"Stay." A pause. "Stay, Whiskers."

The cat remained motionless, those strange dog-like eyes fixed on Jamie's face.

"Okay. Okay, come here."

Whiskers trotted forward—actually *trotted*, like a puppy—and Jamie's hand emerged from his sleeve to scratch behind the cat's ears. In the lamplight, Marcus could see his brother's face, and the expression there made his chest ache. It wasn't quite a smile, but it was something. Something that looked almost like peace.

"You're so weird," Jamie whispered to the cat, and this time there was definitely a smile in his voice. "You're the weirdest cat ever."

Whiskers purred, the sound carrying clearly into the hallway.

"But that's okay," Jamie continued, his voice growing steadier, stronger. "I'm pretty weird too now, I guess."

Marcus leaned his head back against the wall, blinking hard at the ceiling. His mom's therapist voice echoed in his memory: *Everyone heals differently. We can't force him. We just have to be patient.*

They'd been patient. God, they'd been so patient. Through the silence, through the blank stares, through the nights when Jamie's nightmares woke the whole house but he still wouldn't speak about them. His mom had tried everything—grief counselors, art therapy, even a support group for kids who'd lost parents. Jamie had sat through it all like a statue, present but not really there.

And now here he was, talking to a cat who thought he was a dog.

"Let's try again," Jamie said. "Sit."

A soft thump as Whiskers's haunches hit the floor.

"Good. Stay."

Marcus realized his face was wet. He wiped at his cheeks with his sleeve, then carefully, silently, backed away from Jamie's door. His own room felt different when he returned to it—brighter somehow, despite the gathering darkness outside. The calculus problem still waited on his desk, but it seemed less impossible now.

He didn't pick up his pencil. Instead, he sat on the edge of his bed and listened to the murmur of his brother's voice drifting through the wall, teaching a cat to be a dog, finding his own words in the process.

Marcus wouldn't tell anyone. Not yet. This was Jamie's moment, fragile and new, and it needed to be protected. The therapists could wait. His mom could wait. For now, it was enough to know that somewhere inside his silent brother, buried beneath six months of grief, there was still a voice.

And it was coming back.

**Scene 4: Marcus quietly enters Jamie's ...**

**Scene 4: Marcus quietly enters Jamie's room**

The floorboard outside Jamie's door had creaked for as long as Marcus could remember. Dad had always promised to fix it, had even bought the wood putty one Saturday afternoon two years ago. The container was probably still sitting in the garage, unopened.

Marcus avoided it now, placing his foot carefully against the wall where the frame was solid. Through the half-open door, he could see Jamie sitting cross-legged on the carpet, his back to the doorway. Whiskers sat a few feet away, completely absorbed in attacking his own tail—spinning in tight circles like a furry tornado.

"Sit," Jamie whispered.

The word was so soft it might have been the house settling, might have been the wind against the window. But Marcus's breath caught in his throat. He froze, one hand on the doorframe.

Whiskers continued his tail-chasing expedition, oblivious.

Jamie's shoulders slumped slightly. He reached forward with a small piece of turkey from the sandwich Mom had brought up earlier. "Whiskers. Sit."

A little louder this time. Still barely more than air given shape.

The cat stopped spinning, noticed the turkey, and promptly flopped onto his side, batting at Jamie's hand with his paws—no claws, just the soft pads making contact.

Jamie's laugh was silent, just a shaking of his shoulders, but it was there. Real.

Marcus must have shifted his weight, because the hallway floor groaned beneath him.

Jamie's head whipped around. His eyes went wide, and his mouth snapped shut so fast Marcus could hear his teeth click together. The turkey fell from his fingers. Fear flashed across his brother's face—the same look he'd had when their aunt had cornered him at the funeral, insisting he needed to "let it out, sweetie, just let it all out."

Marcus's heart hammered against his ribs. Every instinct screamed at him to say something, to tell Jamie it was okay, that he could talk, that Marcus wouldn't tell anyone, that this was good, so good, keep going. But the terror in Jamie's eyes made him swallow every word.

Instead, Marcus moved slowly, carefully, like he was approaching a wild animal. He sank down onto the carpet near the door, leaving several feet between them. He pulled his knees up, rested his arms on them, and turned his gaze to Whiskers.

The cat had abandoned the turkey and was now investigating a dust bunny under Jamie's bed with intense concentration.

Marcus didn't look at Jamie. Didn't speak. Just sat there, breathing in the familiar smell of his brother's room—the faint scent of the lavender spray Mom used on the sheets, the mustiness of the stack of comics Jamie hadn't touched in months, something vaguely like grass from the window Jamie always kept cracked open.

The silence stretched between them, fragile as spun glass.

Whiskers emerged from under the bed with the dust bunny stuck to his whiskers. He sneezed, shook his head violently, and the gray fluff went flying.

Jamie's shoulders shook again with that soundless laugh.

Marcus counted his own heartbeats. Ten. Twenty. Thirty.

"Down," Jamie whispered.

The word was so quiet Marcus almost convinced himself he'd imagined it. But Whiskers—still standing on all four paws—looked directly at Jamie, meowed once (that strange bark-meow that never got less weird), and promptly jumped onto Jamie's bed.

Marcus pressed his lips together to keep from smiling. From the corner of his eye, he saw Jamie's hand come up to cover his mouth, his eyes crinkling at the corners.

They sat like that for a long time, the three of them, in the dusty afternoon light that filtered through Jamie's window. Marcus kept his breathing even and his posture relaxed, even though his muscles were tense with the effort of staying still, of not making this into something bigger than this moment.

Outside, a car drove past. Downstairs, the TV murmured—Mom was watching one of her cooking shows. Normal sounds. Safe sounds.

Whiskers kneaded Jamie's comforter with his paws, purring loud enough that Marcus could hear it from where he sat.

And then, so soft it was almost nothing:

"Stay."

Marcus closed his eyes briefly, then opened them again, keeping his gaze on the cat. His throat felt tight, but he didn't move. Didn't react. Just existed in this space with his brother, letting the moment be what it was.

Whiskers, naturally, jumped off the bed and trotted over to Marcus, headbutting his knee with enough force to leave a smudge of cat fur on his jeans.

When Marcus finally glanced at Jamie, his brother wasn't looking at him anymore. But the fear had left his face, replaced by something softer. Something that looked almost like relief.

**Scene 5: Late that night, Marcus lies a...**

**Scene 5: Late that night, Marcus lies awake wrestling with whether to tell their mother about Jamie's whispered words.**

The ceiling fan traced lazy circles above Marcus's bed, its shadow spinning endlessly in the amber glow from the streetlight outside. He'd been counting rotations for the past twenty minutes—or maybe it was forty. Time felt elastic at 2:47 AM, stretching and compressing like a rubber band pulled too tight.

His phone sat on his chest, rising and falling with each breath. The screen had gone dark three times already, each time after he'd pulled up his mom's contact and typed out half a message before deleting it.

*Mom, something happened today*

Delete.

*Hey, don't freak out but*

Delete.

*Jamie spoke*

His thumb hovered over the send button. Two words. That's all it would take to change everything.

Marcus set the phone on his nightstand and pressed the heels of his palms against his eyes until he saw stars. The house was quiet except for the familiar nighttime symphony—the refrigerator's hum, the settling of old wood, the distant bark of a dog that never seemed to sleep. From down the hall came nothing. Jamie's room was silent, as it had been for six months.

Six months of silence that everyone wanted to fill.

Marcus rolled onto his side, pulling his blanket up to his chin even though the May night was warm. He could still hear Jamie's voice in his mind, that thread-thin whisper: *Sit. Come on, Whiskers. Sit.*

The words had been so quiet Marcus had almost convinced himself he'd imagined them. But he hadn't. They were real, and they were Jamie's, and they were the first crack in the wall his brother had built around himself since Dad's funeral.

His phone buzzed. Marcus grabbed it, heart jumping—but it was just a notification from some app he'd forgotten to silence. The bright screen made him squint, and there was his mom's contact info, still pulled up from the last time he'd tried to text her.

She'd be thrilled. She'd cry, probably, the good kind of crying she tried to hide behind her hands. She'd want to tell Dr. Patterson, Jamie's therapist. Maybe they'd adjust his treatment plan. Maybe they'd try to recreate the conditions, encourage more interaction with the cat, turn it into a structured therapeutic intervention.

Marcus's stomach twisted.

He thought about the parade of experts who'd cycled through their lives since January. Dr. Patterson with her gentle voice and careful questions that Jamie answered with shrugs or silence. The grief counselor from the school who'd brought coloring books, as if Jamie were six instead of twelve. The occupational therapist who'd lasted exactly two sessions before Mom quietly cancelled the appointments.

Each one had come with credentials and compassion and absolutely no idea what to do when Jamie simply refused to engage. Each one had made promises about timelines and breakthroughs and healing journeys, using words that sounded important but meant nothing when Jamie still wouldn't speak.

And each one had made Jamie retreat further into himself.

Marcus sat up, shoving his pillow against the headboard. The movement made Whiskers, who'd been curled at the foot of his bed, lift his head with a questioning chirp.

"What do I do?" Marcus whispered to the cat.

Whiskers yawned, showing all his teeth, then settled back down with his tail over his nose. Supremely unconcerned. Asking nothing.

That was it, wasn't it? That was the difference.

Whiskers didn't care if Jamie spoke or stayed silent. The cat didn't have goals for him or timelines or gentle encouragement wrapped in therapeutic techniques. Whiskers just existed in his weird, dog-like way, chasing tennis balls and barking at squirrels and breaking every rule about what a cat should be.

And somehow, that had reached Jamie when nothing else could.

Marcus picked up his phone again. His mom deserved to know. She'd been carrying this weight for six months, watching her younger son disappear into silence while trying to hold everything together. She came home exhausted from double shifts at the hospital, still made dinner, still asked about homework, still knocked on Jamie's door every night to say she loved him even when he didn't answer.

She deserved this small piece of hope.

But Jamie deserved something too. He deserved to find his voice again on his own terms, in his own time, without everyone watching and waiting and hoping so hard it became another kind of pressure.

Marcus thought about how he'd been doing the same thing to himself—forcing himself into the shape of what everyone needed him to be. The strong one. The responsible one. The one who had it together while everyone else fell apart. He'd shoved his own grief down so deep he sometimes forgot it was there, until late nights like this when it rose up and pressed against his ribs like something trying to escape.

Maybe they were both doing it wrong. Maybe there wasn't a right way to do this at all.

The fan kept spinning. The streetlight kept glowing. Whiskers kept sleeping, his small body warm against Marcus's feet.

Marcus opened a new text to his mom. His thumbs moved across the screen:

*Everything's okay. Just wanted to say goodnight. Love you.*

He hit send before he could second-guess himself.

Three dots appeared immediately—she was awake too, probably doing paperwork or worrying or both. Her response came through:

*Love you too, sweetheart. Try to get some sleep.*

Marcus set the phone down and slid back under his blanket. He'd made his choice. He'd keep Jamie's secret, at least for now. He'd watch and wait and protect this fragile thing that was growing between his brother and a cat who barked.

And maybe, just maybe, he'd figure out how to let himself break a little too.

The ceiling fan kept spinning, counting off the seconds until tomorrow, when Marcus would have to decide all over again whether silence was something to be broken or something to be honored.

**Scene 6: Marcus sits on the back porch ...**

**Scene 6: Marcus sits on the back porch steps watching Whiskers chase moths in the yard**

The twilight had turned everything purple-gray, that in-between time when the world seemed to hold its breath. Marcus sat on the back porch steps, his geometry homework abandoned beside him, watching Whiskers leap and twist after moths that danced just out of reach.

The cat was ridiculous. He'd spring straight up, all four paws leaving the ground, his tail spinning like a helicopter blade. He'd miss, land awkwardly, shake himself off with offended dignity, then immediately spot another moth and launch himself skyward again. No strategy. No learning from his mistakes. Just pure, unselfconscious commitment to the chase.

A laugh bubbled up in Marcus's chest, unexpected and almost painful. When was the last time he'd laughed? Really laughed, not the polite chuckle he offered when teachers tried too hard to lighten the mood, or the forced smile he gave Dad when asked if he was okay.

Whiskers crashed into the rosebush, emerged with a leaf stuck to his head, and resumed hunting without missing a beat.

"You're an idiot," Marcus said softly, but there was affection in it.

The cat paused mid-stalk, one paw raised, and looked back at him. Those mismatched eyes—one blue, one green—caught the last of the dying light. Then Whiskers sneezed, shook his head, and went back to his moths.

Marcus pulled his knees up to his chest, wrapping his arms around them. From inside the house, he could hear the murmur of the television, Dad watching the news like he did every night, keeping up with a world that had kept spinning even when theirs had stopped.

A moth fluttered past Marcus's face, and Whiskers bounded up the porch steps after it, skidding to a halt inches from Marcus's feet. The cat's haunches wiggled as he prepared to pounce, then he launched himself over Marcus's shoulder, crashed into the porch railing, and tumbled back down the steps.

Marcus should have been worried. Instead, he watched as Whiskers popped back up, completely unbothered, and trotted off after a new target.

That's when it hit him.

Whiskers didn't care what he was supposed to be. He didn't wake up every morning trying to be a proper cat, didn't apologize for barking or chasing his tail or failing to catch a single moth despite a hundred attempts. He just... was. Messy and weird and completely, unapologetically himself.

And Jamie—Jamie, who hadn't spoken in six months, who'd stopped going to therapy, who'd shut down every well-meaning attempt to help him—Jamie whispered to this cat. Played with him. Laughed with him.

Because Whiskers didn't expect anything.

Marcus's throat tightened. He pressed his palms against his eyes, feeling the pressure build behind them.

Everyone expected things from Marcus. Dad needed him to be okay, to be the one who still had it together. The school counselor needed him to "process his grief in a healthy way." His teachers needed him to keep his grades up, to prove that tragedy didn't have to derail a promising student. His friends—the ones who still texted, anyway—needed him to be normal, or at least normal enough that they didn't have to feel awkward around him.

And Marcus had tried. God, he'd tried so hard. He'd smiled when he was supposed to smile. He'd said "I'm fine" until the words lost all meaning. He'd been strong and responsible and everything everyone needed him to be.

But he wasn't fine. He was so far from fine that he'd stolen a cat from the animal shelter just to feel like he had some control over something, anything in his life.

A cool breeze rustled the leaves, carrying the smell of cut grass and the neighbor's barbecue. Normal summer smells. The world insisting on being normal when nothing would ever be normal again.

Whiskers had given up on moths and was now rolling in the grass, batting at his own tail, creating his own entertainment. He looked deranged. He looked free.

What would happen, Marcus wondered, if he stopped trying so hard? If he let himself be as broken as he felt? Would the whole carefully constructed facade come crashing down? Would Dad fall apart if Marcus did? Would Jamie retreat even further into silence if his big brother couldn't hold it together?

Or would it be like Whiskers—messy and strange, but somehow more honest than all the pretending?

The back door creaked open behind him. Marcus quickly wiped his eyes, but it was just Jamie, padding out in his socks, carrying two glasses of lemonade. His little brother sat down beside him without a word, handed him a glass, and stared out at the yard where Whiskers was now stalking a leaf.

They sat in silence, but it was different from the heavy, suffocating silence that usually filled the house. This felt lighter somehow. Shared.

"He's pretty weird," Jamie said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Marcus's hand tightened on his glass. He didn't look at his brother, didn't make a big deal of it. "Yeah," he agreed. "Weirdest cat I've ever seen."

"I like that about him."

"Me too."

Whiskers pounced on the leaf, shook it violently, then dropped it and walked away with his tail held high, victorious over his imaginary prey.

Jamie's laugh was quiet but real. Marcus felt something shift in his chest, like a door opening just a crack.

Maybe healing didn't have to look like everyone expected. Maybe it could be messy and backwards and full of setbacks. Maybe it could bark when it should meow.

The twilight deepened into true darkness, and fireflies began to blink in the yard. Whiskers immediately began chasing them, his white patches glowing in the gloom.

Marcus took a sip of his lemonade. It was too sweet, the way Jamie always made it, but he didn't say anything. They sat together in the gathering dark, watching their impossible cat chase impossible lights, and for the first time in six months, Marcus thought that maybe—just maybe—impossible didn't mean hopeless.
