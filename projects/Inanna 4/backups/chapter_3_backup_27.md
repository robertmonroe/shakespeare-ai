## Chapter 3: The Decree of Extinction

**Scene 1: The Decree of Extinction**

The Hall of Eternal Stars stretched before Inanna, its vaulted ceiling lost in manufactured darkness studded with holographic constellations. Ten thousand years of Anunnaki dominion glittered in those false stars—each point of light representing a world conquered, a species subjugated, a civilization reduced to ore and energy.

She stood among the nobility on the observation tier, her ceremonial robes of woven gold-light feeling heavier than battle armor. The air tasted of ozone and ancient incense, that particular blend of myrrh and synthesized nebula-dust that burned only in the presence of the King. Around her, the great houses of Nibiru had assembled in their finery—the Igigi warrior clans in their crimson mantles, the Nephilim administrators draped in silver circuitry, the lesser bloodlines crowding the galleries above like carrion birds awaiting a feast.

Below, on the obsidian floor polished to mirror-brightness, the throne of Anu rose like a frozen explosion of gold and crystal. Her father sat upon it, ancient and terrible, his face a mask of serene authority that Inanna had learned to read since childhood. Today, that mask showed satisfaction.

*He's already decided,* she realized, her stomach clenching. *This ceremony is merely theater.*

Through the chamber's transparent floor, Earth turned in slow majesty. The blue-green sphere caught the light of its yellow sun, clouds swirling in patterns that Inanna had memorized over centuries of observation. She could see the fertile crescent of Mesopotamia from here, that cradle of human civilization where she had walked among them, learned their names, tasted their wine.

"The question before us," Anu's voice rolled through the hall, amplified by acoustic architecture perfected across millennia, "is not whether the human experiment has failed. That much is beyond dispute."

A murmur of agreement rippled through the assembled nobles. Inanna kept her face carefully neutral, though her fingers curled against her palms hard enough to leave crescents in her flesh.

"The question," her father continued, rising from his throne with the fluid grace that belied his age, "is how we address this failure. How we correct the contamination before it spreads beyond acceptable parameters."

On the massive display screens flanking the throne, images materialized—Earth, that blue-green jewel spinning in the darkness. The view zoomed closer, showing human settlements spreading across the fertile crescents, the river valleys, the coastal plains. Villages of mud brick and carved stone. Fields golden with grain. Children playing in dusty paths.

Inanna had walked those paths. She had eaten bread baked in those clay ovens, had listened to human poets compose verses to her beauty, had watched mothers sing their infants to sleep under stars their eyes could barely perceive. She had been worshipped as a goddess, yes—but she had also been *seen* by them in ways her own kind never bothered to look.

"Security Commander Enlil will present the strategic assessment," Anu announced.

Her uncle strode forward from the military contingent, his boots striking the dais with precise, measured steps. Where Anu was ancient and regal, Enlil was vital and hungry—a warrior in his prime, his muscular frame barely contained by his ceremonial armor. The neural interface ports along his temples gleamed with recent use; he'd been running combat simulations again, Inanna knew. Practicing for a war against an enemy that couldn't possibly fight back.

"Genetic drift has exceeded all projections," Enlil announced, summoning data streams with practiced efficiency. Population graphs spiked upward, genetic markers highlighted in warning red, thermal imaging of human settlements spreading like luminescent patterns across Earth's surface. "Current human population: approximately 15 million, concentrated primarily in the Mesopotamian region but spreading rapidly. Projected population in one hundred cycles: over fifty million."

He gestured, and the holographic display transformed. "The kill switch engineered into their genome by the Chief Architect's laboratories remains viable. When activated, it will induce immediate cellular apoptosis in approximately sixty-three percent of those carrying the active gene. However," Enlil continued, clarifying the data, "mortality from the kill switch *activation* is projected to be lower overall. Our simulations indicate a thirty-seven percent mortality rate across the total human population, factoring in those without the active gene, those with partial immunity, and logistical limitations in achieving complete activation."

"They're breeding true," someone called from the assembly. Lord Nergal, his scarred face split by a predator's grin. "The modifications are becoming hereditary."

"Precisely," Enlil confirmed. "At current rates, within another fifty generations, the kill switch will be completely bred out of the population. Additionally, their capacity for abstract thought, for innovation, for *ambition*—" He let the word hang. "—has exceeded all models. They're asking questions. Building things we didn't teach them. Some have begun to suspect the truth of their origins."

A sharp intake of breath from somewhere behind Inanna. She didn't turn to see who still possessed enough conscience to be disturbed.

"Then the solution is clear," Nergal announced. "Activate the kill switch in those who carry it. Hunt down the rest. I'll lead the culling myself—my Igigi have grown soft without proper sport."

Laughter, scattered but genuine, echoed through the hall. Inanna felt bile rise in her throat.

"A crude solution, nephew," Anu said, though his tone suggested approval rather than rebuke. "And incomplete. Even if we eliminated every human on the planet's surface, their genetic material has spread too far. Caves, islands, remote highlands—we would spend centuries hunting down survivors."

He gestured to Enlil. "Present Project Deluge."

Enlil bowed, manipulating his control interface. "Project Deluge represents the culmination of three centuries of contingency planning. Phase One: The Genetic Cascade. The activation signal will be broadcast from our orbital relay network. Global coverage within six hours. Sixty-three percent of the population carries the active kill switch gene."

The image animated, showing the signal propagating across Earth's surface like a wave of invisible death.

"Phase Two: The Deluge itself. The orbital platforms we positioned during the initial terraforming remain functional. By redirecting their output to the polar ice sheets, we trigger a cascading melt event." The polar regions glowed, then cracked, then collapsed into the surrounding oceans. Massive waves radiated outward from both poles. "Sea levels rise by approximately one hundred meters within the first **14 days**. Every coastal settlement destroyed. Every river valley becomes an inland sea."

*To grasp the enormity of Inanna's decision, it's crucial to understand the severe compression of time she now faces. What seems like 14 days to the Anunnaki—a mere blip in their extended lifespans—translates to a desperate race against the clock for humanity. Inanna's compassion, sharpened by her intimate knowledge of human resilience, compels her to act with unprecedented speed, even if it means sacrificing everything she knows.*

The holographic Earth transformed before their eyes. Continents shrank as the waters rose. The fertile crescent where humanity had built its greatest settlements vanished beneath a spreading blue stain.

"Any humans who survive the genetic cascade will find themselves in a world without shelter, without food, without hope. Combined mortality: over ninety-five percent. The survivors face starvation, exposure, and the predatory species we've already begun seeding in the mountain regions." Enlil's voice rose with barely concealed triumph. "Total extinction achieved within one quarter-cycle, with minimal resource expenditure and no risk to Anunnaki personnel."

Silence fell over the hall. Inanna counted her heartbeats—one, two, three—waiting for someone, *anyone*, to object.

"The mineral extraction facilities?" asked Lord Shamash, ever practical.

"Will require reconstruction, but the automated systems are designed to survive submersion. We estimate eighteen months to restore full production capacity."

"And the biological samples? The genetic archive?"

"Already secured aboard the orbital stations. The human template can be reconstructed if needed, with appropriate modifications to prevent future complications."

Shamash nodded, apparently satisfied. Around him, other nobles were already calculating their shares of the reconstruction contracts, their eyes bright with avarice.

Inanna's gaze swept the crowd, searching for allies, for doubt, for anything resembling the horror that churned in her own chest. She found precious few. Lord Enki, who had actually designed the human genome, wore an expression of carefully masked distaste—but he stood in silence. Lady Ereshkigal, keeper of the death records, watched with the professional interest of one anticipating a significant increase in her workload.

And there—near the back of the Igigi delegation—a young warrior whose name Inanna couldn't recall, his face pale, his hands trembling slightly at his sides. Their eyes met for a brief moment before he looked away, shame and fear warring in his expression.

*At least I'm not entirely alone,* she thought. *Though that may not matter.*

"The Council of Twelve has reviewed the proposal," Anu announced, reclaiming the hall's attention. "We have found it sound. Therefore, by the authority vested in this throne by the First Compact of Nibiru, I hereby decree: the human experiment is terminated. All specimens are to be eliminated. The cleansing will commence at the next orbital alignment—three days hence."

He raised his scepter, that ancient rod of office that had commanded the fates of a hundred worlds, and brought it down against the throne's arm with a sound like thunder.

"So it is spoken. So it shall be done."

The hall erupted in applause. Nobles raised their voices in praise of the King's wisdom, his decisive leadership, his protection of the empire's interests. Someone began a chant—"Anu! Anu! Anu!"—and it spread through the crowd like wildfire.

Inanna forced her hands to move, to mime the motions of celebration. Her face ached from the effort of maintaining her smile. Around her, the cream of Anunnaki civilization cheered the extinction of 15 million souls as casually as they might celebrate a successful pest extermination.

**Scene 3: A Mother's Warning**

The celebration spilled from the Hall of Eternal Stars into the adjoining reception chamber, where crystal formations harvested from Nibiru's deepest caverns lined the walls. Each one captured and refracted the bioluminescent light streaming from living chandeliers overhead—colonial creatures from the methane seas of a conquered moon, pulsing in synchronized rhythms, their blue-green glow washing over the assembled nobility like waves upon a shore.

Inanna moved through the crowd with practiced grace, accepting congratulations she didn't deserve for a victory she abhorred. Servants in simple gray tunics bore trays of fermented nectar, the amber liquid glowing faintly with enzymes that made it palatable only to Anunnaki physiology. The nobles snatched glasses without acknowledgment, their attention fixed on the holographic entertainment projecting above the central fountain—a rotating display of Earth, its blue surface marked with red zones indicating population centers soon to be erased.

"Remarkable density in the river valleys," Lord Shamash was saying to a cluster of admirers, gesturing at the projection with his drink. "The creatures congregated there like insects around sweetwater. Makes the cleanup considerably more efficient."

Laughter rippled through the group.

Inanna kept walking, her ceremonial robes suddenly too heavy, too warm. The golden thread woven through the fabric caught the bioluminescent light and threw patterns across the polished floor—patterns that reminded her of the cave paintings she'd observed through the monitoring drones. Human hands pressed against stone, leaving marks that said *I was here. I existed.*

Soon, nothing would remain to prove they ever had.

"Princess!" A young noble approached with an eager smile. "Magnificent news, isn't it? My father says the flooding will create the most spectacular geological formations. He's already planning an expedition to observe the aftermath."

"How forward-thinking of him."

"Indeed! Though I confess, I'll miss the entertainment value. The monitoring feeds have been quite diverting these past centuries. Did you know some of them actually developed music? Primitive percussion and vocal arrangements. Charming, in a simple-minded way."

Inanna's nails dug into her palms. "Charming."

"Ah, but I'm monopolizing your attention." The noble bowed with practiced grace. "Do enjoy the celebration, Princess."

He vanished into the crowd, and Inanna resumed her slow circuit of the chamber. Near the fountain, a minor administrator stared into his drink with an expression that might have been discomfort. By the eastern windows, a young priestess stood apart from her sisters, her lips moving in what could have been prayer. An elderly scholar watched the holographic Earth with something other than celebration in his ancient eyes.

Three. Perhaps four, if she counted the servant who flinched every time someone mentioned the word "extinction."

Out of hundreds.

"Inanna."

The voice came from her left, barely above a whisper. Inanna turned to find her mother standing in the shadow of a crystal formation, her silver robes blending with the blue-green light until she seemed almost translucent.

Queen Antu held no drink. Her hands were clasped before her, the only sign of tension the slight whitening of her knuckles.

"Mother."

They stood in silence for a moment, the celebration swirling around them like a current around two stones in a stream. Antu's face was composed as ever—the perfect mask of royal dignity she had worn for millennia. But her eyes met Inanna's, and in them, Inanna saw something she couldn't quite name. Not horror, exactly. Not even disagreement. Something older. Something tired.

"You should be mingling," Antu said finally. "Your absence from the festivities will be noted."

"Let it be noted."

"Inanna." The single word carried a weight of warning.

"How can you stand here?" Inanna kept her voice low, conscious of the nobles drifting past. "How can any of them? We're discussing the murder of 15 million thinking, feeling beings. Beings we *created*."

"Like the culling of an invasive species." Antu's tone was flat. "Like the controlled burn of an overgrown forest. Like a hundred other administrative necessities this empire has undertaken across a thousand worlds."

"Is that what you believe?"

The question hung between them. Antu's expression flickered—just for an instant—before the mask reasserted itself.

"What I believe is irrelevant. What matters is what is."

"That's not an answer."

"No," Antu agreed softly. "It isn't."

She glanced around the chamber—a quick, practiced sweep that took in every potential observer—before leaning closer.

"There are things," she breathed, "that a queen cannot say. Cannot even think, not in any way that leaves evidence. But a mother..." She paused, and her hand brushed Inanna's arm. She pressed something small and cool into Inanna's hand, closing her daughter's fingers around it. "Remember your naming day gift."

Then she stepped back, her public mask sliding into place with practiced ease.

"Do try the nectar, dear. The vintage is exceptional." She raised her voice just enough to be overheard. "And do remember to congratulate Lord Shamash on his contribution to the environmental projections. He's quite proud of his calculations."

Then she was gone, gliding through the crowd with the effortless grace of someone who had spent millennia navigating treacherous waters.
With a subtle flick of her wrist, she activated the chip. A holographic display bloomed in her palm, displaying coordinates—a remote region deep within the primordial jungle, a place beneath Anunnaki notice. *The jungle remembers.* 34.5°N, 36.2°E

**Scene 4: Flight from the Sky**

The summons came through her personal comm unit moments after her mother's departure – a priority one override from King Anu. Her presence was demanded in his private chambers immediately. This could not be ignored.

*To understand the compressed timeline, remember that Anunnaki perceive time differently. Millennia pass for them as human lifetimes do for humans, giving them a different sense of urgency—or a lack thereof. However, Inanna, influenced by her growing empathy for humans, feels the urgency acutely.*

Inanna's breath hitched. Anu's summons, delivered so soon after her mother's cryptic warning, felt like a closing trap. Fear, cold and sharp, pierced through her anger. But beneath it, a defiant ember glowed. *He suspects.*

She slipped into a quiet alcove, ostensibly to adjust her robes, but actually to examine the data chip her mother had given her. The alcove was dimly lit, shielded from the main chamber by a screen of cascading water. The soft hiss of the water provided a thin veil of privacy. *Time to see what Mother intends.*

Understanding crashed over her. Escape. Sanctuary. A hidden purpose, waiting in the wild. A surge of hope warred with the dread of defying her father. But the image of the doomed humans, those she had walked among and admired, solidified her resolve.

Before she could fully assimilate the information, a second summons blared from her comm, even more urgent, laced with raw command. Anu's patience had reached its limit. Decision time. Obey, and face his wrath, or embrace this treacherous path of rebellion, guided by her mother's enigmatic message.

Adrenaline surged. Flight, now. But first… She glanced around the alcove. Good. No surveillance. With quick, precise movements, Inanna deleted the access logs on her comm unit, severing the digital thread connecting her to Antu. A dangerous gamble, but necessary to protect her mother.

Turning from the alcove, Inanna did not head towards her father's chambers. Instead, a fierce determination hardening her features, she made for the nearest transport bay. She needed a ship, a small, swift vessel, and a diversion to cover her escape. And a weapon. Her hand instinctively went to the hidden blade concealed within her sleeve, a memento from her naming day long ago. *Words will not be enough,* she remembered her mother saying.

As she moved swiftly through the corridors, her mind churned, calculating probabilities, anticipating countermeasures. The jungle was the destination, but survival was not the objective. Not anymore. She would find allies, uncover secrets, and strike back against the Anunnaki before they could extinguish humanity.

*First, the jungle. Then, vengeance.*

*Approximately one hour later, * inside her private quarters aboard Nibiru Orbital Station, Inanna reviewed her options.*

She knows. She's always known.*

Queen Antu, who smiled through state functions and played the role of dutiful consort with flawless precision. Who had given her daughter a knife on her naming day and spoken of remembering. Who had, perhaps, been running her own quiet rebellion for longer than Inanna had been alive.

The summons came through her personal comm unit before she could process her mother's gift—a single pulse of crimson light that made her blood run cold. Her father's cipher. His private chambers. Immediately.

Inanna straightened her shoulders and began moving through the crowd.
**Scene 4: Flight from the Sky**

The transport bay hummed with barely suppressed power, the air thick with the smell of ionized particles and refined lubricants. Technicians swarmed around docked vessels, performing last-minute checks and calibrations, their movements precise and efficient.

As Inanna approached, she noticed a Lanky Igigi technician, Zael, who was always tinkering with ship modifications beyond his station; he looked startled when their eyes met, but quickly bowed. Inanna remembered Zael's quiet unease during the extinction vote projection. Deciding to gamble, she approached him directly.

"Technician," Inanna stated, her voice carrying a regal tone. "I require a scout vessel prepped for immediate departure. Minimal sensor profile, maximum speed."

Zael's eyes widened slightly, fear and hope mixing within them. "Princess Inanna? I... that is highly irregular. Such requests go through channels…"

"Channels are for those who follow," Inanna interrupted, her voice softening slightly, noting Zael's discomfort. "I need someone who understands priorities. Someone who can make things… happen. Discretely." She subtly gestured towards the holographic displays showcasing Enlil's extermination plan.

Zael visibly swallowed hard. "There is a newly modified scout, Princess. Experimental engine tweaks, dampeners... virtually untraceable. But it's not officially cleared for royal transport."

"Then consider it a field test," Inanna said, a faint smile gracing her lips. "Your expertise will be... invaluable. Should it perform well." She paused, letting the unspoken incentive hang in the air.

Zael nodded quickly, his earlier fear replaced by a focused intensity. "Understood, Princess. Launch bay seven. I'll reroute the pre-flight checks. It will appear routine, just a system diagnostic."

"See to it," Inanna stated, offering a subtle nod of approval. "And technician?"

"Princess?"

"Discretion is… paramount."

Zael met her gaze, a silent understanding passing between them. He then turned and moved with purpose, weaving seamlessly amidst the other technicians, whispering directives, and manipulating console commands. Within moments, launch bay seven began to display signs of activity, a single scout vessel powering up, its engines emitting a low, resonating hum.

Inanna strode towards the scout ship, her heart pounding in her chest, but now with a spark of hope. She had found an unlikely ally in the most unexpected place. She reached the boarding ramp and turned to face Zael one last time, his features now shrouded in the dim light.

"Thank you, Zael," she whispered.

Zael simply nodded, his eyes reflecting a silent commitment.

The system pinged acknowledgment. Bay doors hissed open, revealing a sleek, silver craft, its engines glowing with barely contained energy. Other technicians scrambled to clear the launch path, their faces a mixture of surprise and deference, oblivious to the silent act of rebellion occurring before them. Inanna turned and ascended the ramp, disappearing into the belly of the ship.
