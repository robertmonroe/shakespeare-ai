## Chapter 3: Desert's Edge - Review

**1. Internal Consistency**

*   **Issue:** In Scene 1, Bond tells M that Isabella was at the meeting with Dubois and Dubois called her by name. Yet in Scene 2, when Bond asks Omar about Isabella, Omar says "Rossi…the name sounds familiar. Not a name whispered in polite company." This seems contradictory. If her involvement was significant enough for Bond to know she was at a meeting and to report it to M, it's unlikely Omar wouldn't have known who she was.
*   **Issue:** Bond is portrayed as highly competent. It is unusual for him not to check his weapon and have to leave Isabella to disarm the device.
*   **Issue:** Scene 3 describes the title of Rossi's scientific paper as only "partially visible due to damage". It could be argued that MI6 would be able to access this document without any such impediment.
*   **Issue:** In Scene 5 Isabella's rationalisation and tone are wildly different from that in scene 4. She goes from 'The world is diseased' to asking 'Join me'.
*   **Issue:** In multiple places, Bond has to "cut the thought short". It's a clumsy phrase that is overused.

**2. Clarity**

*   **Issue:** In scene 4, Dr. Moreau's name is dropped in with no explanation. This breaks reader immersion and requires an explanation. The reader is more likely to believe she is the villain if it is not contrived.

**3. Plot Holes**

*   **Issue:** The level of security required to enter the lab suggests that a "nervous technician" would not have the authority to allow Bond to bypass it, even when faced with a weapon.
*   **Issue:** In multiple scenes, there is repeated reference to mini-bars and alcohol. This is often to replace actual plot advancement.
*   **Issue:** The "Emergency Stop" button appearing at a critical moment is a classic plot device, but it feels too convenient. How would Bond, unfamiliar with the system, know what it was?

**4. Redundancy**

*   **Issue:** There is repetition of Bond's internal conflict and guilt. It's established early on and doesn't need to be reiterated in every scene. The description of desert air in the first scenes is a repeated motif.
*   **Issue:** Multiple scenes end with the same phrase "He had a long night ahead". This is too repetitive.

**5. Flow and Transitions**

*   **Issue:** The transitions between scenes are generally good, but the ending of Scene 3 feels abrupt. The paragraph about the increasing heat needs more build-up to be fully effective as a transition.
*   **Issue:** The ending of Scene 6 is sudden and confusing, Bond disarms Isabella and they leave. Bond's reasoning for leaving her is not explored and should be for a more believable ending.

**6. Actionable Fixes**

1.  In Scene 1, rewrite Omar's dialogue to acknowledge Isabella's name while still conveying suspicion. Perhaps he could say, "Rossi…yes, I've heard whispers. A woman with powerful friends, and equally powerful enemies." This maintains consistency and builds intrigue.
2.  In Scene 2, add a sentence that sees Bond checking his weapon and considering his next move to reinforce competency.
3.  In Scene 3, replace "partially visible due to damage" with a more believable explanation for MI6's knowledge, such as, "The original paper was heavily redacted, but MI6 managed to recover a digitally enhanced version."
4.  In Scene 4, give a brief explanation for the use of 'Dr Moreau', perhaps as part of the status report.
5.  In Scene 5, smooth the transition of tone and justification by giving greater emphasis to the world building aspect, it should be believable for the reader why she would be so fanatic about a solution, and that the ends justify the means.
6.  In all scenes, where appropriate, remove the phrase "cut the thought short" and replace it with a more appropriate phrase.
7.  In Scene 4, replace the nervous technician with a more credible obstacle, such as a malfunctioning security system that Bond must override, or a confrontation with a more seasoned guard who is tricked rather than easily intimidated.
8.  Remove references to alcohol and mini bars, unless it is directly related to the plot.
9.  In Scene 6, add a line or two of dialogue from Isabella about the abort sequence, hinting at its existence. This makes Bond's discovery less arbitrary. Perhaps a taunt: "You wouldn't even know where to begin to stop this."
10. Review and remove the repeated motif of the "long night ahead"
11. In scene 3, provide greater narrative around the rising heat and Bond's thought process.
12. Scene 6 provides no narrative around why the pair leave the scene together. Expand the paragraph.
