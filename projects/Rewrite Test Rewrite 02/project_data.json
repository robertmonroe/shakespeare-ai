    "description": "Marcus Chen has spent six months becoming invisible—overlooked by bullies at school and barely noticed by his exhausted mother at home since his father left for an overseas work contract. Everything changes when a summer storm damages the local zoo and Marcus discovers Bruno, a terrified four-month-old black bear cub, hiding in his backyard. In an impulsive decision that transforms his life, Marcus hides Bruno in the family garage, finding purpose and connection in caring for someone who needs him.\nAs their bond deepens, Marcus recruits his former friend Jamie to help maintain the secret, transforming the garage into a proper den. For the first time in months, Marcus feels visible and alive. But as Bruno grows rapidly and the zoo director intensifies her search, Marcus's mother begins noticing the changes in her son. When the truth can no longer be hidden, Marcus faces an impossible choice: return Bruno to the rehabilitation program where he can learn to be wild and free, or keep him and condemn them both to a life in hiding. In learning to let go, Marcus discovers that true love sometimes means sacrifice, and that the bravest act is knowing when to open your hands.",

When Bruno accidentally injures Marcus during play, he's forced to confront a painful truth: loving someone sometimes means letting them go. With help from his best friend Jade and his father, Marcus learns that real courage isn't about holding on to what makes you feel better—it's about doing what's right, even when it breaks your heart. Through his journey with Bruno, Marcus discovers his own voice and realizes he was never truly invisible after all.",

Six months after his father left for Dubai, Marcus has perfected the art of fading into the background. That night, a violent summer storm tears through their neighborhood, damaging the local zoo's perimeter. The next morning, while his mother sleeps after her shift, Marcus discovers Bruno—a terrified, mud-covered black bear cub—hiding beneath the rhododendrons in their overgrown backyard. In a moment that defies logic but answers a desperate need, Marcus coaxes the shaking cub into the cluttered garage, using leftover chicken from the fridge. As he watches Bruno curl into a corner, Marcus feels something he hasn't felt in months: needed.",

When Jamie, his former best friend, follows him one afternoon and discovers the truth, Marcus expects betrayal.

    "outline": "# Book Summary\n\nMarcus Chen has spent six months becoming invisible—overlooked by bullies at school and barely noticed by his exhausted mother at home since his father left for an overseas work contract. Everything changes when a summer storm damages the local zoo and Marcus discovers Bruno, a terrified four-month-old black bear cub, hiding in his backyard. In an impulsive decision that transforms his life, Marcus hides Bruno in the family garage, finding purpose and connection in caring for someone who needs him.\n\nAs their bond deepens, Marcus recruits his former friend Jamie to help maintain the secret, transforming the garage into a proper den. For the first time in months, Marcus feels visible and alive. But as Bruno grows rapidly and the zoo director intensifies her search, Marcus's mother begins noticing the changes in her son. When the truth can no longer be hidden, Marcus faces an impossible choice: return Bruno to the rehabilitation program where he can learn to be wild and free, or keep him and condemn them both to a life in hiding. In learning to let go, Marcus discovers that true love sometimes means sacrifice, and that the bravest act is knowing when to open your hands.\n\n# Chapter List\n\n3 chapters total.\n\n# Chapter Details\n\n## Chapter 1: The Storm\n### Summary\n\nMarcus Chen navigates another invisible day at school, enduring the casual cruelty of being overlooked while his mother works another double shift at the hospital. Six months after his father left for Dubai, Marcus has perfected the art of fading into the background. That night, a violent summer storm tears through their neighborhood, damaging the local zoo's perimeter. The next morning, while his mother sleeps after her shift, Marcus discovers Bruno—a terrified, mud-covered black bear cub—hiding beneath the rhododendrons in their overgrown backyard. In a moment that defies logic but answers a desperate need, Marcus coaxes the shaking cub into the cluttered garage, using leftover chicken from the fridge. As he watches Bruno curl into a corner, Marcus feels something he hasn't felt in months: needed.\n\n### Key Events\n- Marcus endures another day of being invisible at school and comes home to an empty house\n- A violent storm damages the local zoo overnight, creating chaos in the neighborhood\n- Marcus discovers Bruno hiding in his backyard the next morning, terrified and alone\n- Marcus makes the impulsive decision to hide Bruno in the garage, feeding him and creating a makeshift shelter\n- For the first time in months, Marcus feels a sense of purpose and connection\n\n## Chapter 2: The Secret\n### Summary\n\nOver the next three weeks, Marcus's life transforms around his secret. He takes on odd jobs—mowing lawns, walking dogs—to buy food for Bruno, who grows alarmingly fast, gaining thirty pounds. Marcus masks the smell with his mother's air fresheners and invents elaborate excuses for his constant garage visits. When Jamie, his former best friend, follows him one afternoon and discovers the truth, Marcus expects betrayal. Instead, Jamie offers help, and together they transform the garage into a proper den with stolen hay bales and a kiddie pool. As their friendship rekindles, Marcus experiences joy he'd forgotten existed. Meanwhile, Dr. Sarah Okoye, the zoo's director, appears on local news pleading for information about the missing cub, and reward flyers blanket the neighborhood. Marcus's mother begins noticing changes—his new confidence, mysterious phone calls, constant trips to the garage—and starts asking questions that make Marcus's carefully constructed lies crumble.\n\n### Key Events\n- Marcus scrounges money through odd jobs to feed Bruno, who grows rapidly\n- Jamie discovers the secret and, instead of exposing Marcus, offers to help\n- The boys transform the garage into a proper den, rekindling their friendship\n- Dr. Okoye intensifies the search with news appearances and reward flyers throughout the neighborhood\n- Marcus's mother notices her son's transformation and begins asking probing questions\n- Bruno outgrows the garage space, making the secret increasingly difficult to maintain\n\n## Chapter 3: Opening Hands\n### Summary\n\nThe inevitable confrontation arrives when Marcus's mother follows him to the garage and discovers Bruno. Her shock gives way to fear—not for herself, but for Marcus and the cub. She calls Dr. Okoye, and within hours, the zoo director arrives with a specialized team. As Marcus watches them prepare to transport Bruno, Dr. Okoye sits with him and explains the rehabilitation program: Bruno will learn to forage, to fear humans appropriately, to be wild again before being released to a sanctuary. She tells Marcus that his care kept Bruno alive, but keeping him longer would have stolen his chance at a real life. In their final moments together, Marcus holds Bruno close, whispering promises to visit. As the transport van drives away, Jamie stands beside him, and Marcus's mother wraps an arm around his shoulders—truly seeing him for the first time in months. In the weeks that follow, Marcus volunteers at the zoo, watching Bruno's progress through one-way glass. He begins speaking up at school, joining Jamie for lunch, and having real conversations with his mother. When his father video calls, Marcus tells him the whole story, and for once, doesn't pretend everything is fine. Marcus learns that the connection he made with Bruno changed him forever, teaching him that being seen means stepping into the light, and that love—real love—sometimes means letting go.\n\n### Key Events\n- Marcus's mother discovers Bruno in the garage and calls Dr. Okoye\n- Dr. Okoye arrives with her team and explains Bruno's rehabilitation program to Marcus\n- Marcus says goodbye to Bruno, understanding that letting him go is an act of love\n- Marcus begins volunteering at the zoo, watching Bruno learn to be wild again\n- Marcus reconnects with his mother and Jamie, stepping out of invisibility\n- Marcus has an honest conversation with his father, no longer hiding his feelings\n- Marcus discovers that the brief connection with Bruno has permanently changed him, teaching him about sacrifice, love, and the courage to be seen",
