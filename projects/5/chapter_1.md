## Chapter 1: The Assignment

**Scene 1: Max Monroe is abruptly pulled from a surveillance operation in Prague**

The extraction came without warning.

Max Monroe had been sitting in a cramped Škoda across from the Hotel Paris for eleven hours when his encrypted phone vibrated once—the recall signal. No explanation. No context. Just the single pulse that meant drop everything and move.

He'd left the vehicle running, the keys in the ignition for the cleanup team that would materialize within minutes. By dawn, it would be as if he'd never been in Prague at all.

Now, twenty-three hours later, his body still operated on Central European Time while his mind tried to catch up with the fluorescent reality of Langley, Virginia. The Gulfstream had touched down at 2:47 AM, and Max had been shuttled directly from the private airstrip to CIA headquarters in an unmarked SUV with windows tinted black enough to violate civilian traffic laws.

The building loomed against the night sky, a brutalist monument to secrets. At this hour, most of its windows were dark, but Max knew the real work happened in rooms without windows at all.

"ID and credentials," the guard at the first checkpoint said, his voice flat with the particular boredom of the graveyard shift.

Max slid his badge across the scanner. The red light turned green with a soft beep that seemed too cheerful for the setting.

"Proceed to elevator bank C. You're cleared for sub-level three."

Sub-level three. Max felt something tighten in his chest—not quite anxiety, but its more sophisticated cousin. In his eight years with the agency, he'd been to sub-level three exactly twice. Both times had resulted in operations that didn't officially exist.

The elevator descended with the smooth, expensive silence of German engineering. Max caught his reflection in the polished steel doors—forty-eight hours of stubble, eyes red-rimmed from the overnight flight, his leather jacket creased from being slept in. He looked exactly like what he was: a man pulled from the field without time to prepare.

The doors opened onto a corridor that smelled of recycled air and floor polish. Track lighting cast everything in a sterile glow. Another guard waited, this one younger, his hand resting with practiced casualness near his sidearm.

"Mr. Monroe. This way, please."

They walked in silence, their footsteps muffled by industrial carpet the color of dried blood. Max counted the doors they passed—twelve on the left, nine on the right—a habit from training that had become reflex. Know your exits. Always.

The guard stopped at an unmarked door, swiped his own credentials, then stepped aside. "Director Chen is waiting."

Sarah Chen. Max's handler for the past three years, though "handler" felt too simple a word for their relationship. She was the voice in his ear during operations, the strategist who'd kept him alive in Caracas, the woman who'd once told him he had a gift for making people believe his lies.

He'd never been sure if she meant it as a compliment.

The guard's hand moved to the door handle, but Max caught the subtle shift in his posture—the slight tension in his shoulders, the way his eyes didn't quite meet Max's. Whatever waited on the other side of that door, even the security detail had been briefed enough to be nervous.

"Thank you," Max said, keeping his voice neutral.

The guard nodded and opened the door.

The briefing room beyond was smaller than Max expected, dominated by a single conference table of polished mahogany. No windows, as he'd predicted. The walls were bare except for a digital clock displaying 03:17 in red numerals and a flat-screen monitor, currently dark.

Director Sarah Chen stood at the far end of the table, her back to him, studying something on a tablet. She wore a charcoal suit despite the hour, her black hair pulled back in a style that was both severe and elegant. When she turned, her expression was unreadable—a skill Max recognized because he'd spent years perfecting it himself.

"Max. Thank you for coming on such short notice."

As if he'd had a choice.

"Prague was just getting interesting," he said, closing the door behind him. The lock engaged with a soft click that seemed to seal them off from the rest of the world.

"Prague is handled. We have other priorities." She gestured to a chair. "Sit. We don't have much time, and you need to be wheels-up for Vienna in six hours."

Vienna.

Max remained standing, his instincts firing warning signals. "What's in Vienna?"

Sarah Chen's eyes met his, and in them he saw something that made his pulse quicken—not fear exactly, but the recognition of a particularly dangerous game about to begin.

"Your next assignment," she said, pressing a button on the table. The monitor flickered to life, displaying a photograph of a woman with dark hair and eyes the color of Arctic ice. "And possibly the most important operation of your career."

Max looked at the face on the screen, committing it to memory even as questions multiplied in his mind.

"Her name is Elena Volkov," Sarah continued, her voice taking on the clipped efficiency of a briefing. "And for the next six weeks, she's going to be the center of your world."

**Scene 2: Director Sarah Chen briefs Max on Operation Nightfall**

The briefing room existed in a state of perpetual twilight. No windows interrupted the charcoal-gray walls, and the overhead lights—recessed and clinical—cast everything in a bluish pallor that reminded Max of a morgue. He'd been in this room dozens of times before, but it never felt less sterile, less designed to strip away anything resembling comfort or distraction.

Director Sarah Chen stood at the head of the obsidian conference table, her fingers resting lightly on a manila folder stamped with red diagonal stripes. She hadn't opened it yet. That was deliberate—Sarah never did anything without intention.

"Operation Nightfall," she said, her voice carrying the particular flatness of someone delivering bad news they'd already made peace with. "Viktor Volkov. Russian diplomat, Vienna station. On paper, he's a cultural attaché coordinating educational exchanges. In reality, he's a procurement officer."

She slid the folder across the table. It whispered against the polished surface.

Max didn't reach for it immediately. "Procurement of what?"

"NATO tactical communications protocols. Troop movement schedules for the Baltics. Satellite encryption keys." Sarah's dark eyes held his without blinking. "The kind of intelligence that gets people killed. Entire units, if deployed correctly."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop. Max opened the folder. The first photograph showed a man in his late forties—thick neck, receding hairline, the kind of face that disappeared in crowds. Viktor Volkov looked like an accountant, not a traitor.

"We've had him under surveillance for eight months," Sarah continued, moving to the wall-mounted screen. She tapped her tablet, and the display illuminated with a web of connections—names, dates, locations linked by color-coded lines. "He's careful. Doesn't use digital communication for anything sensitive. No dead drops we can find. His diplomatic immunity means we can't touch him directly, and the Austrians won't move without concrete proof."

Max studied the surveillance photos cycling across the screen. Viktor at a café, Viktor entering the Russian embassy, Viktor at the opera. Always alone or with other diplomats. Nothing incriminating.

"Traditional methods have failed," Sarah said, and there was something almost like frustration in her voice—a hairline crack in her professional veneer. "We've tried everything short of breaking into the embassy itself. Which, as I'm sure I don't need to remind you, would be an act of war."

"So where does the proof live?" Max asked, though he suspected he already knew the answer.

Sarah changed the image. A study materialized on screen—dark wood paneling, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, a antique desk positioned beneath a window. The photograph had been taken from an extreme angle, probably from a building across the street with a telephoto lens.

"Viktor's private study in his residence. Separate from the embassy. We have thermal imaging that shows he spends two to three hours there most evenings. Alone." She zoomed in on the desk. "We believe he keeps physical copies of the documents there. Photographs them, then passes the images during in-person meetings we can't monitor."

Max leaned back in his chair, the leather creaking softly. "You need someone inside the residence."

"We need someone who can get inside without raising suspicion. Someone Viktor would never suspect." Sarah's expression remained neutral, but her next words carried weight. "We need his wife to do it for us."

The screen changed again. This time, a woman appeared—late thirties, dark hair swept back from a face that suggested intelligence more than conventional beauty. High cheekbones, observant eyes, a slight asymmetry to her smile that made it seem genuine. She wore a navy dress at what looked like a gallery opening, holding a glass of wine, caught mid-conversation.

"Elena Volkov," Sarah said. "Née Morozova. Former art history professor at Moscow State University. Married Viktor five years ago. No children. No known political affiliations. By all accounts, she's a civilian who married into a world she doesn't fully understand."

Max studied Elena's face. There was something in her eyes—a distance, maybe loneliness. Or perhaps he was projecting what he needed to see.

"She has unrestricted access to the study?" he asked.

"According to our surveillance, yes. She's often home alone while Viktor works late. We've observed her entering the study on multiple occasions." Sarah paused. "She's also been attending cultural events solo with increasing frequency. The marriage appears... strained."

Max heard what she wasn't saying. A lonely wife. An absent husband. A classic access point.

"You want me to recruit her," he said.

"I want you to get close to her. Gain her trust. Convince her to photograph the documents in Viktor's study." Sarah's voice hardened. "Viktor is scheduled for transfer to Beijing in six weeks. Once he's in China, he'll be completely beyond our reach, and the intelligence pipeline continues. This is our window."

Six weeks. Max had worked faster timelines, but not often, and never with stakes this high.

"What's her vulnerability?" he asked, falling into the operational calculus that had defined his career. Everyone had one—the crack in the foundation you could exploit.

Sarah pulled up another series of images. Elena at a museum, Elena at a concert, Elena sitting alone at a café with a book. Always alone. Always that same distant expression.

"Isolation," Sarah said. "She left her career, her friends, her entire life in Moscow when she married Viktor. She speaks limited German. Her social circle consists almost entirely of other diplomatic wives she has nothing in common with. She's intellectually starved and emotionally neglected."

"So I become what she's missing." Max closed the folder. "How do you want the approach?"

"Organic. Natural. Nothing that could trigger suspicion." Sarah turned off the screen, and the room seemed darker without its glow. "There's a lecture series at the Kunsthistorisches Museum starting next week. 'Renaissance Patronage and Power.' Elena has attended every session of similar series for the past two years. You'll be there."

Max nodded slowly, the operation taking shape in his mind. The accidental meeting. The shared interest. The gradual building of trust. It was a familiar choreography, one he'd performed before, though never with consequences quite this severe.

"What's the authorization level?" he asked.

Sarah met his eyes, and for a moment, the professional mask slipped enough for him to see the weight she carried. "This comes from the top, Max. The Director of National Intelligence is personally monitoring this operation. The NATO Secretary General has been briefed. If Volkov's intelligence reaches the wrong hands before we can shut him down..." She didn't finish the sentence. She didn't need to.

Max felt the familiar tightening in his chest—the physical manifestation of responsibility settling onto his shoulders. People would die if he failed. Maybe not immediately, maybe not in ways he'd ever see, but they would die nonetheless.

"I'll need full operational support," he said. "Legend, cover story, technical assets."

"Already prepared. You're Dr. Maxwell Morrison, visiting fellow at the University of Vienna, researching Baroque art patronage. Published academic, independently wealthy, recently divorced." Sarah slid another folder across the table, thicker than the first. "Your legend has been backstopped for five years. Publications, conference appearances, even a ex-wife in Boston who'll confirm the story if anyone checks."

"Thorough."

"This operation doesn't have room for mistakes." Sarah's voice softened fractionally. "I know what I'm asking, Max. I know this kind of mission takes a toll."

Max thought about Elena's photograph—that distant look in her eyes, the loneliness he recognized because he'd weaponized it before. He thought about Viktor, who looked like an accountant but traded in death. He thought about the soldiers whose lives depended on intelligence remaining secure.

"When do I leave?" he asked.

"Tomorrow. You have a week to establish your cover before the first lecture." Sarah gathered her tablet, preparing to leave. "Your handler in Vienna is already in place. Contact protocols are in the folder. And Max—" She paused at the door. "Elena Volkov is a civilian. Whatever happens, remember that. She's not the enemy."

The door sealed behind her with a pneumatic hiss, leaving Max alone in the twilight room. He opened the second folder and began reading his new life, committing details to memory with practiced efficiency. But his eyes kept returning to Elena's photograph, to that expression that suggested she was already searching for something she couldn't name.

In six weeks, he would either save lives or destroy an innocent woman's world.

Possibly both.

**Scene 3: Sarah presents Elena's comprehensive dossier**

Sarah slid a manila folder across the polished table, followed by a tablet displaying a high-resolution photograph. Max's eyes settled on the image before him.

Elena Volkova stood in what appeared to be the courtyard of the Belvedere Museum, autumn light catching the copper tones in her dark hair. She wore a charcoal coat, hands tucked into its pockets, her gaze directed at something beyond the frame. There was a stillness to her posture that suggested either profound contemplation or profound loneliness.

"Elena Mikhailovna Volkova, née Sokolova," Sarah began, her fingers dancing across her own tablet. The wall screen flickered to life with a cascade of images. "Thirty-four years old. Born in Moscow to a family of academics—father was a philosophy professor, mother taught literature. She followed the family tradition."

More photographs appeared. Elena in a university lecture hall, younger, animated, gesturing toward a projected image of a Renaissance painting. Elena at a gallery opening, champagne flute in hand, mid-laugh with a group of colleagues. The transformation between those images and the solitary figure in Vienna was striking.

"She was on track for tenure at Moscow State University," Sarah continued. "Published two well-received papers on Italian Baroque art. Specialized in Caravaggio, particularly his use of chiaroscuro—the interplay of light and shadow."

Max leaned back, studying the progression of images. "Let me guess. She met Viktor and threw it all away for love."

"Not quite that simple." Sarah tapped the screen, pulling up what appeared to be surveillance footage from a Moscow café, five years old according to the timestamp. "Viktor was already married when they met. His first wife died in a car accident six months later. He and Elena were married within the year."

The implication hung in the air like cigarette smoke.

Max picked up the physical file, flipping through pages of surveillance reports. "Convenient timing."

"The accident was investigated. Nothing conclusive." Sarah stood, moving to the window overlooking the Virginia landscape. "What matters is that Elena gave up everything. Her position, her research, her entire life in Moscow. Viktor's diplomatic career meant constant relocation—Prague, Geneva, now Vienna. Difficult to maintain an academic career when you're moving every eighteen months."

"Does she resent him for it?" Max asked, studying a more recent photograph. Elena at the Vienna State Opera, seated alone in a red velvet chair during intermission, program folded in her lap.

"That's what you need to find out." Sarah returned to the table, scrolling through more files. "Our psychological profile suggests a woman experiencing significant isolation. She attends cultural events three to four times per week—always alone. Viktor rarely accompanies her. His schedule is consumed by diplomatic functions she's not invited to."

The screen displayed a calendar marked with colored dots. Red for gallery visits. Blue for concerts. Green for lectures at the University of Vienna's art history department, which she audited without enrollment.

"No friends?" Max asked.

"Not in Vienna. She maintains email correspondence with former colleagues in Moscow, but those contacts have diminished over the past year." Sarah pulled up a graph showing communication frequency. The downward trend was unmistakable. "She's a woman adrift, Max. Intelligent, educated, underutilized. The perfect combination of vulnerability and access."

Max studied another photograph—Elena in a café, laptop open, surrounded by art books. Her expression was absorbed, almost hungry. He recognized that look. He'd seen it in mirrors during his own moments of isolation, those rare instances when the masks came off.

"What does she do all day?" he asked.

"She's writing a book. Or trying to." Sarah brought up intercepted cloud storage documents. "A monograph on Caravaggio's late period. She's been working on it for three years. Progress is slow. We suspect Viktor doesn't take it seriously."

"Does he know about the book?"

"He knows. He's made comments at dinner parties—we have audio—dismissing it as a hobby. Something to keep her occupied." Sarah's tone carried a rare edge of distaste. "He's controlling in subtle ways. Monitors her spending. Questions her whereabouts. Classic patterns of psychological manipulation."

Max set down the file, his fingers drumming once against the table. "You're painting a picture of an unhappy marriage."

"I'm painting a picture of an opportunity." Sarah met his eyes. "Elena Volkova is isolated, intellectually starved, and trapped in a gilded cage. You're going to offer her something she hasn't had in five years."

"Which is?"

"To be seen." Sarah pulled up a final image—Elena at a gallery, standing before a Caravaggio painting, her face illuminated by the carefully directed spotlights. The chiaroscuro her specialty demanded. Light and shadow. "Someone who understands her work. Who values her mind. Who makes her feel like the person she used to be."

Max studied the photograph for a long moment. In the play of light across Elena's features, he saw something that made his jaw tighten almost imperceptibly. Recognition, perhaps. Or warning.

"When do I leave?" he asked.

"Forty-eight hours. We've established your cover as an art consultant based in London, in Vienna to authenticate a private collection. You'll have a gallery opening to attend Thursday evening." Sarah handed him another folder, thicker than the first. "Everything you need to know about Italian Baroque art is in here. I suggest you study it carefully. Elena will spot a fraud in seconds."

Max took the folder, feeling its weight. Six weeks to become someone else. Six weeks to make a lonely woman trust him. Six weeks to betray that trust for secrets that might prevent a war.

"One more thing," Sarah said as he stood to leave. "Elena's not just Viktor's wife. According to our sources, she was the one who encouraged him to pursue the diplomatic track in the first place. She may be more complicit than she appears."

Max paused at the door, glancing back at the wall screen where Elena's image still glowed. The woman in the photograph looked back at him across the distance of surveillance and circumstance, her expression unreadable.

"Or," he said quietly, "she might be exactly what she appears to be. A woman who made a terrible mistake and doesn't know how to escape it."

Sarah's silence was answer enough.

**Scene 4: Sarah outlines the mission timeline and methodology**

Sarah Chen pressed a button on the remote, and the wall screen shifted to display a calendar marked with red X's counting down from forty-two days. The harsh fluorescent lighting of the briefing room cast sharp shadows across her face as she turned to face Max.

"Six weeks," she said, her voice cutting through the recycled air like a blade. "That's all we have. Viktor Volkov's transfer to Beijing is confirmed for November fifteenth. Once he's in China, he'll be untouchable, and whatever intelligence pipeline he's running will go underground."

Max leaned back in his chair, the leather creaking beneath him. He studied the calendar, mentally calculating the margin for error. It was tight—too tight for his liking—but he'd worked with less.

"The timeline's aggressive," he said. "Building trust takes time. If I rush it, she'll sense something's off."

"Which is why we're not leaving the first contact to chance." Sarah clicked the remote again. The screen now displayed a sleek gallery interior, all white walls and track lighting. "The Kunsthalle Wien is hosting a special exhibition next Friday evening—'Echoes of the Soviet Avant-Garde.' Elena hasn't missed a Russian art exhibition in Vienna in three years. She'll be there."

Max rose from his seat and moved closer to the screen, examining the gallery layout. His reflection ghosted across the projected image—a shadow merging with the pristine exhibition space.

"And my cover?"

Sarah slid a thin folder across the conference table. The sound of paper on polished wood seemed unnaturally loud in the confined space. "Alexander Hartley, independent art dealer specializing in Eastern European acquisitions. We've been building this identity for two months—gallery contacts in London and Prague, a legitimate website, transaction histories, even a few pieces currently on consignment at Sotheby's."

Max opened the folder. Inside were business cards, a passport, credit cards, all bearing his new name. A photograph showed him at what appeared to be an art auction, deep in conversation with a well-dressed woman. He didn't remember the photo being taken—which meant the agency had been planning this longer than Sarah was letting on.

"You've been thorough," he observed, a hint of something unreadable in his tone.

"We always are." Sarah moved to stand beside him, her reflection joining his on the screen. "The gallery owner, Markus Brenner, is an asset. He'll introduce you to Elena as a favor to an old friend. From there, the connection needs to be organic. You'll express interest in her expertise, perhaps consult her about a piece you're considering for acquisition."

"The Kandinsky in Viktor's file."

"Exactly." A ghost of approval flickered across Sarah's features. "She wrote her dissertation on Kandinsky's Munich period. It's her passion. Use that."

Max turned from the screen, his eyes meeting Sarah's. In the sterile light, he could see the fine lines around her eyes, the tension in her jaw. This mission mattered to her—perhaps more than she was saying.

"What's the secondary objective?" he asked quietly.

Sarah's expression hardened. "There is no secondary objective. Get the documents, get out, maintain plausible deniability for Elena if possible. Clean and simple."

"Nothing about this is simple." Max closed the folder, his fingers resting on his new identity. "You're asking me to manipulate a woman who's done nothing wrong, to turn her against her husband, potentially destroy her life. All for photographs of documents we're not even certain exist."

"They exist." Sarah's voice dropped to barely above a whisper, but the certainty in it was absolute. "Three NATO officers are dead, Max. Two in accidents that weren't accidents, one from a heart attack at thirty-four with no prior health conditions. Whatever Viktor is selling, people are dying to protect it."

The room seemed to contract around them, the air growing heavier. Max could hear the faint hum of the ventilation system, the distant click of footsteps in the corridor outside. He thought of the woman in the dossier—Elena, sitting alone at a café, her face turned toward the sunlight streaming through the window. Unaware that her world was about to be carefully, methodically dismantled.

"When do I leave?" he asked.

"Thursday morning. You'll have two days to settle into your cover before the exhibition." Sarah moved to the door, her hand resting on the handle. "Your apartment in Vienna is already prepared, Leopoldstadt district. The address is in your operational packet, along with your contact protocols."

Max gathered the folder, feeling the weight of Alexander Hartley settling onto his shoulders like a familiar coat. "And if six weeks isn't enough?"

Sarah paused, her back to him. When she spoke, her voice carried the weight of decisions made in rooms even more secret than this one.

"Then we move to contingency plans neither of us will enjoy." She opened the door, and the sounds of the building rushed in—voices, computers, the machinery of intelligence gathering. "Don't let it come to that, Max. For everyone's sake."

She left him alone in the briefing room, surrounded by the ghosts of his new identity and the ticking clock on the screen. Forty-two days. Max stood motionless, his mind already in Vienna, already calculating angles and approaches, already becoming someone else.

The fluorescent lights hummed their monotonous song, and somewhere in the building, a phone rang unanswered. Max looked once more at Elena's photograph on the screen, committing her face to memory—the slight sadness in her smile, the intelligence in her eyes, the loneliness that seemed to emanate from the image itself.

"I'm sorry," he said to the empty room, though he wasn't sure if he was apologizing to Elena, to himself, or to whoever Alexander Hartley might have been in another life.

Then he turned and walked out, leaving the briefing room behind, carrying nothing but a folder full of lies and six weeks to make them truth.

**Scene 5: Alone in his apartment after the briefing**

The first gray light of dawn filtered through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Max's apartment, casting long shadows across the hardwood floor. He sat at the dining table—a sleek piece of glass and chrome that doubled as his workspace—with Elena Volkova's dossier spread before him like a dissection.

The apartment reflected the man: minimal, functional, revealing nothing. White walls. Black leather furniture. No photographs, no plants, no evidence that anyone actually lived here. Just a staging ground between assignments, a place to sleep and prepare. The coffee maker hissed in the kitchen, the only sound besides the distant hum of early morning traffic on Connecticut Avenue.

Max picked up one of the surveillance photographs, holding it toward the window. Elena at a gallery opening in Vienna, three months ago. She stood apart from a cluster of diplomats' wives, her attention fixed on a painting the camera hadn't captured. Her posture was elegant but isolated—shoulders slightly turned away from the crowd, champagne glass held but not sipped. The photographer had caught her in profile: high cheekbones, dark hair swept into a chignon, an expression that seemed far away.

He set it down and picked up another. Elena leaving the Kunsthistorisches Museum, alone. Another at a café on Graben, reading. Always alone. Always with that same quality of distance, as if she existed in a space slightly removed from the world around her.

*Just another mark*, he told himself, reaching for his coffee. *Another asset to be cultivated.*

But his hand paused over a close-up shot, taken with a telephoto lens. This one was different. She'd been caught unaware, looking up at something—a building, perhaps, or the sky. Her face was unguarded, and in her eyes he saw something that made his chest tighten inexplicably. Not sadness, exactly. Recognition, maybe. The look of someone who understood what it meant to wear a mask.

Max pushed back from the table, crossing to the window. The city was waking up below—joggers on the sidewalk, taxis beginning their morning rounds. Normal people living normal lives. He pressed his palm against the cool glass.

He'd run this play before. Different cities, different names, different faces. Istanbul. Prague. Singapore. The approach was always the same: identify the weakness, exploit the need, establish trust, extract what was required. Clean. Professional. Effective.

So why did his reflection in the window look tired?

He returned to the table, forcing himself to focus on the operational details. Elena's routine: Tuesday mornings at the Albertina, Thursday evenings at the opera, Sunday afternoons at Café Central. Her vulnerabilities: isolation, intellectual hunger, a marriage that appeared more political arrangement than partnership. Viktor traveled frequently, leaving her alone for days at a time.

The approach vector was clear. Art would be the entry point—his cover as a private acquisitions consultant was already being established. He'd studied enough to be convincing, and Elena's academic background meant she'd appreciate genuine knowledge. First contact would be accidental, carefully orchestrated to seem like fate.

Max pulled out a yellow legal pad and began sketching the operation timeline. Week one: establish presence, create opportunities for natural encounters. Week two: initial contact, build rapport. Week three: deepen connection, identify emotional leverage points. Week four—

He stopped writing.

The pen hovered over the paper as he stared at Elena's photograph again. In the harsh morning light, he could see the fine print of her dossier beneath it: *No known political affiliations. No indication of disloyalty to husband. Described by acquaintances as "kind" and "thoughtful."*

Kind. Thoughtful. The words seemed to pulse on the page.

Max set down the pen and rubbed his eyes. He was tired, that was all. The flight from Bogotá had been long, and he hadn't slept properly in three days. This hesitation was just fatigue, the normal human reluctance before stepping into a role that would consume the next six weeks of his life.

He gathered the photographs into a neat stack, slipping them back into the folder. His fingers lingered on the cover, where someone had stamped in red ink: *OPERATION NIGHTFALL - EYES ONLY*.

"It's just a job," he said aloud to the empty apartment. His voice sounded hollow in the minimalist space, absorbed by the bare walls and offering no echo, no confirmation.

He carried the folder to the bedroom and locked it in the safe hidden behind a framed print—an abstract piece he'd chosen because it meant nothing, revealed nothing. As the safe door clicked shut, he caught sight of himself in the mirror above the dresser.

For just a moment, he let himself wonder what Elena would see when she looked at him. Would she recognize another exile, another person playing a part? Or would she see only what he showed her—the carefully constructed fiction of a man who didn't exist?

Max turned away from his reflection and headed for the shower. He had a flight to Vienna in eight hours, and before that, there were cover documents to review, contact protocols to memorize, a legend to inhabit so completely that he could almost forget who he really was.

Almost.

As the hot water beat against his shoulders, he made himself a promise: this time would be no different than the others. He would do what needed to be done, extract what needed to be extracted, and move on to the next assignment. Elena Volkova was a means to an end, nothing more.

But even as he repeated this to himself, her eyes from the photograph lingered in his mind—intelligent, sad, searching. The eyes of someone waiting for something she couldn't name.

Max turned the water to cold and let it shock the doubt from his system. By the time he stepped out, his face was composed again, professional. The operative had returned, and the man who'd hesitated at the dining table was locked away as securely as the dossier in the safe.

He had work to do.
