# Book Summary

"Chester Takes the Stage" follows sixteen-year-old Maya Chen, a socially awkward teen who finds solace in her volunteer work at Riverside Zoo, particularly with Chester, an Elvis-obsessed chimpanzee who has taught himself the King's signature dance moves. When budget cuts compromise zoo security, Chester escapes and his impromptu street performance goes viral, thrusting both him and Maya into an unexpected spotlight. As Maya searches for Chester, she discovers he's found refuge with her estranged grandmother Rose, a former 1960s backup singer living at Meadowbrook Nursing Home, who has been secretly coaching Chester's performances and rediscovering her own passion for music.

The viral fame attracts competing interests: a talent agent eager to exploit Chester's popularity and the zoo's new director demanding his immediate return. Maya must navigate these pressures while reconnecting with her grandmother and confronting her own tendency to hide from the world. With help from an ethics-minded journalist, Maya learns to advocate for Chester's true needs—not captivity or celebrity, but placement in a sanctuary where he can live with dignity. Through this journey, both Maya and Rose discover that authentic connection requires vulnerability and courage, and that sometimes the most important performance is showing up as your true self.
