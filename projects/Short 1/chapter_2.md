## Chapter 2: Transmissions from the Sea of Tranquility

**Scene 1: Sarah sits in the darkened tra...**

**Scene 1: Sarah sits in the darkened translation room**

The translation room smelled of burnt coffee and electronic ozone. Sarah sat three feet from the monitor, close enough to see the grain of the video feed, the slight compression artifacts that betrayed the signal's quarter-million-mile journey. The room's fluorescent lights had been dimmed at her request—she'd found that the darkness helped her focus on Bobby's hands, on the subtle nuances of movement that carried meaning.

On the screen, Bobby floated in the habitat's main compartment, his dark fur haloed by the white walls of the lunar module. Zero gravity suited him better than it suited most astronauts. He moved with an ease that the human crews never quite achieved, repositioning himself with small touches against handholds designed for his grip.

"Transmission 1-7 beginning," Jerry Kowalski announced from the communications console behind her. His voice carried the forced brightness of someone trying to maintain enthusiasm for a task growing routine. "Vitals look good. He's been active for about two hours."

Sarah didn't respond. She was already watching Bobby's hands.

The chimpanzee oriented himself toward the camera, his dark eyes finding the lens with an awareness that still startled her. He'd always known when he was being watched. Even in the lab, years ago, he'd perform differently when he knew she was behind the observation glass.

Bobby's right hand rose to his chest, then extended outward. *Bobby.* The name-sign she'd given him when he was three years old, adapted from ASL but uniquely his.

His hands moved through the practiced sequence of the daily report. *Habitat.* His fingers measured the air. *Temperature good.* A pause as he glanced at the food dispenser mounted to the wall. *Food enough.* Another pause. *Water good.*

"Standard report," Tom Garrett said from the doorway. The Mission Director had a habit of appearing silently, watching over shoulders. "Nothing unusual?"

Sarah held up a hand for silence. Something in Bobby's posture had changed. He'd stopped mid-sign, his attention drawn to the small window set into the habitat's wall. The porthole was barely eighteen inches across, but it framed a view no chimpanzee had ever seen: the lunar surface stretching to a too-close horizon, and above it, the black of space.

Bobby's hands moved again, but slower now. Hesitant.

*Window,* he signed. Then his hands made a shape Sarah had taught him for things that didn't work correctly, that failed to meet expectations. *Wrong.*

"What's he saying?" Jerry asked.

Sarah leaned forward. "He says the window is wrong."

"Wrong how? Is there a seal problem? Jerry, get Engineering—"

"Wait." Sarah's voice cut through the sudden tension. "He's not done."

Bobby's hands were moving in a way she'd never seen before. He signed *sky*—the upward sweep of both hands she'd taught him using planetarium visits and picture books. But then his hands came together sharply, the sign for *broken* that he'd learned when a puzzle toy had shattered. 

*Sky broken.*

The words hung in the air of the translation room like an accusation.

"Sky broken?" Tom's voice carried skepticism. "That doesn't make sense. There's no sky on the moon. Just space."

"He doesn't have a sign for space," Sarah said quietly. "Sky is the closest concept he has."

Bobby was still floating there, still looking at the camera. His hands moved again, repeating the sequence. *Window wrong. Sky broken.* Then he added a third sign, one that made Sarah's chest tighten: *Why?*

Jerry laughed, a nervous sound. "He's probably just confused by the view. It's not like anything he saw in training."

But Sarah had spent seven years learning to read the subtle expressions that crossed Bobby's face, the tilt of his head that indicated genuine confusion versus playful mischief versus something deeper. What she saw now was none of those things.

What she saw was distress.

"He's trying to tell us something," she said. "Something he doesn't have the vocabulary for."

"Chen, he's reporting on systems like he's supposed to." Tom moved closer to the screen. "The window comment is probably just... I don't know, stimulus response. He sees something unexpected, he comments on it. Doesn't mean there's a problem."

On screen, Bobby had turned back to the window. His hand reached out, fingers splaying against the thick glass. For a long moment, he simply floated there, staring out at the alien landscape.

Then his hands moved again, signing to himself in the way he sometimes did when he thought no one was watching. Sarah had seen him do it in his enclosure late at night, practicing signs or perhaps—she'd always wondered—thinking in the only language he fully possessed.

*Dark,* he signed. *Always dark.*

"Transmission concluding," Jerry said. "He's moving back to the rest module."

The screen flickered as Bobby propelled himself out of frame. For a moment, the camera showed only the empty habitat, the white walls and the small window with its frame of absolute black.

Then the feed cut to the holding screen—the NASA logo rotating slowly against a star field that was, Sarah thought, far more romantic than the real thing Bobby could see from his window.

Tom was already pulling out his phone. "I'll have Engineering check the window seals. Probably nothing, but better safe than sorry."

"It's not the seals," Sarah said.

"Then what is it?"

She looked at the empty screen, seeing in her mind Bobby's hands forming those shapes. *Window wrong. Sky broken. Why?*

"I think," she said slowly, "he's trying to tell us that something about what he's seeing doesn't match what he expected. What we taught him to expect."

"We prepared him for the lunar environment. Showed him footage, ran simulations—"

"We showed him pictures, Tom. Images on screens. We couldn't prepare him for what it actually *feels* like to look out a window and see that." She gestured at the blank monitor. "To see a sky that never changes. Stars that don't twinkle. A horizon that's all wrong because the moon is so much smaller than Earth."

Jerry had pulled up the transmission log, scrolling through previous reports. "He hasn't mentioned the window before. All his other transmissions have been strictly procedural."

"Maybe it took him this long to process what he was seeing," Sarah said. "To find a way to articulate it."

Tom was quiet for a moment, his jaw working. Finally: "Keep monitoring. If he shows signs of distress affecting his ability to perform his duties, we'll need to know."

"And if he's distressed but still performing?"

The Mission Director met her eyes. "Then he does his job. Same as every astronaut who's ever looked out a window and felt homesick."

He left, his footsteps echoing in the corridor outside.

Jerry began shutting down the communications array, the banks of equipment powering down with soft electronic sighs. "You really think he understands what he's seeing? I mean, understands it enough to have an opinion about it?"

Sarah thought about Bobby at three years old, learning his first signs. Bobby at five, combining signs in new ways to describe things she hadn't taught him words for. *Water bird* for swan. *Hurt fruit* for rotten apple. *Metal sky* for ceiling.

He'd always been trying to bridge the gap between his experience and his limited vocabulary.

"I think," she said, "that we sent someone to the moon who's smart enough to know something's wrong, but doesn't have the language to tell us what."

She saved the transmission file, flagging it for detailed review. On her secondary monitor, the mission timeline scrolled past—weeks of transmissions still to come, months of isolation Bobby would endure.

Outside, through the translation room's small window, she could see the Houston sky: blue and bright and filled with the comfortable chaos of clouds. A sky that made sense. A sky that wasn't broken.

She wondered what Bobby was looking at now, in his small habitat a quarter million miles away. Wondered what signs he was making to himself in the darkness, trying to name the unnameble thing he'd discovered.

The loneliness of being the only one who could see that something was wrong.

**Scene 2: A week into the mission, Sarah...**

The press conference room smelled of coffee and ambition—bitter and overheated. Sarah sat at the long table beneath the harsh fluorescent lights, her hands folded in her lap to keep them from trembling. To her left, Tom Garrett adjusted his microphone with the ease of a man who'd never questioned whether his words mattered. To her right, General Whitfield sat ramrod straight in his dress uniform, chest heavy with ribbons that caught the camera flashes like small explosions.

Behind them, projected on a screen the size of a billboard, Bobby's face filled the room.

The photograph had been taken during a training session—Bobby in his modified pressure suit, one hand raised in what the caption called a "wave to America." Sarah knew it was actually the sign for "finished." He'd been asking if the day's work was done.

"Ladies and gentlemen," the NASA PR director was saying, a woman named Patricia Holbrook whose smile seemed shellacked in place, "we're proud to present the latest update on Operation Tranquility Base. As you can see, our pioneering astronaut is thriving in his lunar habitat."

Thriving. The word landed in Sarah's stomach like a stone.

That morning, alone in the observation room at 4 AM because she couldn't sleep, she'd watched Bobby's private transmission. The one that wouldn't be shown here. He'd sat in the center of his habitat, the Earth visible through the porthole behind him—a blue marble in the black—and signed with slow, deliberate movements: "Troop gone. Bobby call. Nobody answer."

He'd repeated it three times, his dark eyes fixed on the camera as if he could will her to appear on the other side. Then he'd moved to the porthole and pressed both palms against it, a gesture she'd seen him make a thousand times in the enclosure when he wanted to be let out.

"Dr. Chen?" Patricia's voice cut through her memory. "Perhaps you could share some of Bobby's recent communications with our friends in the press?"

Sarah felt every camera in the room swing toward her like weapons. She cleared her throat and reached for the water glass, buying seconds.

"Of course." Her voice came out steadier than she felt. "Bobby has been very communicative. He's reported on all his daily activities—his meals, his exercise routines, his system checks."

"And his mood?" This from a reporter in the front row, a young man with a tape recorder thrust forward like an offering. "Is he happy up there?"

Happy. She thought of Bobby's signs that morning, the way his shoulders had hunched inward, making himself smaller. The way he'd touched his chest with both hands—the sign for "alone"—then spread his arms wide to encompass the entire habitat. Alone everywhere.

"Bobby is adapting remarkably well," she said, and hated herself for it. "He's following all protocols and maintaining the habitat systems with precision."

Tom leaned toward his microphone. "What Dr. Chen is too modest to mention is that Bobby's cognitive performance has actually exceeded our projections. He's not just following procedures—he's problem-solving in real-time. Yesterday, he identified and corrected a minor pressure irregularity before Mission Control even detected it."

The reporters scribbled eagerly. Sarah watched them transform Bobby's desperate competence—his frantic need to do everything right, to be good enough to bring home—into a triumph of American ingenuity.

"General Whitfield," called a woman from the back, "there are reports that the Soviets are planning their own primate mission. How does Bobby's success factor into the broader space race?"

Whitfield's jaw tightened with satisfaction. "What we're demonstrating here is the superiority of American innovation and training. While our competitors are still running ground tests, we have a fully operational lunar base with a crew member who represents the cutting edge of behavioral science." He nodded toward Sarah. "Dr. Chen's work has been instrumental in this achievement."

Instrumental. Sarah's nails dug into her palms.

Patricia advanced to the next slide—a video clip from three days ago that had been carefully selected, carefully edited. Bobby floated in the reduced gravity, performing a somersault that looked playful. What the clip didn't show was what came after: Bobby signing "Wrong. Wrong. Wrong." while touching his feet to the floor, trying to make his body feel heavy again.

"As you can see," Patricia narrated over the footage, "our astronaut is even finding ways to enjoy his historic mission."

Laughter rippled through the room. Warm, indulgent laughter.

Sarah watched Bobby's image tumble across the screen and felt something crack inside her chest. She thought of the years she'd spent teaching him, the careful vocabulary they'd built together. Words for food and comfort, for curiosity and play. She'd taught him "home" and "friend" and "safe."

She'd never taught him "betrayal," but she wondered if he was learning it now.

"Dr. Chen." A new voice, from a reporter she didn't recognize. "Can you tell us what Bobby's most recent message was? His actual words, in sign language?"

The room fell silent. Sarah felt Tom's warning glance, felt Patricia's smile tighten almost imperceptibly.

She could tell them. She could sign it right here, right now, let the cameras capture Bobby's truth: "Troop gone. Bobby call. Nobody answer." She could make them see what she saw every morning in those private transmissions—the way Bobby searched the habitat as if his family might be hiding somewhere, the way he signed to the empty air.

Her hands remained folded in her lap.

"This morning," she said slowly, "Bobby signed that his systems check was complete and that he was beginning his exercise routine." All true. He had signed those things. Eventually. After the parts she was omitting. "He's very diligent about maintaining the schedule."

"Sounds like a model astronaut," the reporter said, and the room chuckled again.

Patricia beamed. "Indeed. Now, if we could move on to questions about the habitat's technical specifications..."

The conference continued for another forty minutes. Sarah answered when called upon, her responses carefully calibrated to reveal nothing that mattered. She watched herself on the monitors positioned around the room—a small Asian woman in a NASA blazer, looking professional and composed. A translator faithfully rendering the signs of a chimpanzee a quarter-million miles away.

A liar.

When it finally ended, Tom caught her elbow as she tried to escape. "That went well," he said. "You handled the questions perfectly."

"Did I?" She couldn't keep the edge from her voice.

His expression flickered—something that might have been concern, or might have been annoyance at her tone. "Sarah, I know this is difficult. But what we're doing here matters. The data we're gathering, the boundaries we're pushing—"

"He asked for his troop this morning." The words came out flat. "He called for them. He waited for an answer."

Tom glanced around, but the reporters had already moved on, clustering around Whitfield for additional quotes. He lowered his voice. "He's adjusting. It takes time."

"He's alone, Tom. He doesn't understand why."

"He understands the mission. You trained him yourself."

"I trained him to follow commands. That's not the same as understanding." She pulled her arm free. "And it's definitely not the same as consent."

Tom's face hardened. "We've been over this. The psychological evaluations—"

"Were designed to confirm what you already decided." Sarah felt seven days of sleepless nights rising in her throat. "You wanted a mission. You got one. Congratulations."

She walked away before he could respond, her heels clicking against the linoleum like a countdown. Behind her, she heard Patricia's laugh, bright and hollow, as she entertained a cluster of reporters.

In the bathroom, Sarah locked herself in a stall and leaned against the cool metal door. Her hands were shaking now, finally allowed to shake. She raised them in front of her face and signed to the empty air, practicing words she would never send:

"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

But Bobby was a quarter-million miles away, and sorry wasn't a sign she'd ever taught him. Maybe because she'd never imagined she'd need it.

Maybe because she'd known, even then, that some betrayals were too large for any language to contain.

**Scene 3: During a late-night transmissi...**

**Scene 3: During a late-night transmission review**

The building hummed with its after-hours emptiness, the fluorescent lights in the corridors dimmed to conservation mode. Sarah's office glowed like a fishbowl in the darkness, the only occupied space on the entire floor. She'd sent her assistant home three hours ago. The cleaning crew had come and gone, leaving behind the chemical scent of disinfectant that couldn't quite mask the stale coffee in her mug.

2:47 AM, according to the clock on her desk. She'd stopped counting the nights like this.

On the monitor, Bobby's transmission from earlier that day played for the seventh time. The timestamp in the corner read 14:22 GMT—his afternoon session, though afternoon and morning had no meaning in the lunar habitat's controlled environment. No meaning anywhere on the Moon, where the sun crawled across the sky in its month-long arc.

Sarah's hand hovered over the pause button, then drew back. She needed to see it again.

Bobby sat in the center of the habitat's main chamber, the curved white walls behind him marked with scuff marks from his movements. The camera angle was fixed, mounted high—too high for him to reach, even when he'd tried that first week, his dark form a blur of frustrated motion in the archived footage.

Now he'd stopped trying.

His signing had changed. That's what had kept her here, watching, rewinding, watching again. The technical team had flagged the transmission as "standard welfare check" and moved on. But they didn't know his language like she did. They didn't see what she saw.

Bobby's hands moved through the familiar shapes: *Bobby* (tap chest), *report* (hands moving outward), *habitat* (arms forming a circle). Standard opening. But then—

Sarah leaned forward, her face inches from the screen.

*Earth* (pointing up, though on the Moon "up" held a different meaning), then *home* (hands forming a roof), then *gone* (hands sweeping away), and finally *place* (palm down, indicating location). But he didn't pause between the signs as she'd taught him. Instead, they flowed together, each bleeding into the next, his hands barely completing one shape before beginning another.

"Earth-home-gone-place," Sarah whispered.

She'd never taught him that. Never even conceived of teaching him that.

Her fingers trembled as she typed notes into her tablet: *Compound construction. Self-generated. Expressing concept of lost/unreachable origin point?*

On screen, Bobby continued. His dark eyes stared directly at the camera with an intensity that made Sarah's breath catch. He knew she was watching. Somewhere, somehow, across that quarter-million miles of void, he knew.

*Bobby* (chest tap), then *cage* (hands gripping invisible bars)—she'd taught him that one during habitat training, trying to desensitize him to enclosed spaces—then *no* (hand slashing), and *walls* (hands pressing outward against nothing).

"Bobby-cage-no-walls."

Sarah's hand went to her mouth. The tablet slipped from her lap, clattering against the floor. She didn't pick it up.

A cage with no walls. A prison without bars. How did you describe being trapped in freedom, confined by infinite space? The habitat gave him more room than he'd ever had in the lab, more than the outdoor enclosure at the facility. But he was still caged—caged by vacuum, by distance, by the fundamental hostility of the lunar environment.

And he'd found the words for it. Created them.

She rewound again. Watched his hands move through the sequence. There was deliberation in his movements, a careful precision that suggested he'd practiced this. How long had he spent in that white chamber, trying different combinations, different ways to make her understand?

The transmission continued. Bobby moved closer to the camera, his face filling the frame. His expression—God, his expression. Sarah had spent six years studying chimpanzee facial expressions, had published two papers on emotional communication in great apes. She knew every subtle variation of their features.

This was grief.

*Sarah* (the sign he'd created for her: hand brushing temple, mimicking how she pushed her hair back when concentrating), *see* (fingers pointing from his eyes to the camera), *Bobby* (chest tap), then a sequence that made her stomach drop: *sky* (hand sweeping overhead), *always* (circular motion), *dark* (hands closing over eyes).

He paused. His hands lowered. Then rose again.

*Bobby* (chest tap), *always* (circular motion), *alone* (single finger raised, isolated).

Another pause. Longer this time. His chest rose and fell with breath she couldn't hear through the silent transmission. The habitat's audio system had malfunctioned on day three. They'd decided it was non-essential for the mission parameters.

Bobby's hands moved again, slower now, and Sarah felt her eyes burning.

*Same* (fingers together), *thing* (object sign), then a question marker—palm up, head tilted.

"Sky always dark. Bobby always alone. Same thing?"

Sarah's chair rolled backward as she stood abruptly, her legs hitting the desk. Coffee sloshed over the rim of her forgotten mug, spreading across a stack of transmission logs. She didn't notice.

He was asking if his isolation and the lunar darkness were equivalent. If the perpetual night of the Moon and his perpetual solitude were the same phenomenon. If being alone was a type of darkness.

Or if darkness was a type of alone.

"Jesus Christ," she breathed. "Jesus Christ, Bobby."

Philosophy. He was developing philosophical frameworks. Metaphorical thinking beyond anything she'd documented, anything she'd thought possible. The cognitive leap required to connect emotional states with environmental conditions, to recognize the parallel, to question it—

Her hand found the edge of the desk, gripping hard enough that her knuckles went white.

She'd done this to him. Created a mind sophisticated enough to understand its own suffering, then stranded that mind in hell.

The transmission ended. Bobby's face froze on screen, those dark eyes staring out at her, waiting for an answer to his question that she didn't know how to give.

The monitor defaulted to the queue screen: seventeen more transmissions waiting for review, each one time-stamped, each one containing more of Bobby's evolving language, more of his desperate attempts to communicate what it meant to be the only living thing on an entire world.

Sarah sank back into her chair. The coffee stain spread across her desk, seeping into paper, but she couldn't look away from Bobby's frozen face.

Her phone buzzed. A text from Director Khalid: *Media briefing 0800. Need your talking points on chimp's latest transmissions. Public loves the "space monkey" content. Ratings through the roof.*

Space monkey. Content. Ratings.

Sarah's fingers moved across her keyboard, pulling up the response template Mission Control had approved. Cheerful signs. Simple concepts. *Bobby good. Bobby strong. Sarah proud. Earth watches. Bobby important.*

Lies a child could see through.

She looked back at the frozen image. At those eyes that had learned to recognize the difference between darkness and solitude, and wondered if they were the same.

Her hand hovered over the send button.

In the corner of her screen, a new notification appeared: incoming transmission from Tranquility Base. Bobby's morning report, right on schedule.

Sarah clicked play.

**Scene 4: Mission Control convenes a mee...**

**Scene 4: Mission Control convenes a meeting**

The conference room smelled of burnt coffee and desperation. Sarah sat at the long table, her fingers drumming against the laminate surface, watching condensation bead on the outside of her water glass. Through the interior windows, she could see the main control floor—a hive of activity that had become her second home over the past three weeks.

Tom Garrett entered first, his tie loosened, dark circles under his eyes. He wouldn't meet her gaze. That told her everything she needed to know about whose side he'd be on.

General Whitfield arrived next, his uniform crisp despite the late hour, followed by Dr. Raymond Pierce, NASA's consulting psychologist—a man Sarah had met exactly once before, during her initial hiring interview. He carried a leather portfolio and wore the kind of sympathetic expression that made her teeth ache.

Helen Voss from Public Relations was last, her heels clicking efficiently against the linoleum. She set down a stack of glossy folders, each embossed with the NASA logo.

"Dr. Chen, thank you for joining us," Whitfield said, as if she'd had a choice. He remained standing, hands clasped behind his back. "We need to discuss the content of recent transmissions."

Sarah's jaw tightened. "Bobby's transmissions, you mean."

"The subject's transmissions," Whitfield corrected. "There's been some concern about the... trajectory of the communications."

"Trajectory." Sarah let the word hang in the air. "He's lonely. Disoriented. That's not a trajectory, General. That's suffering."

Helen Voss opened one of her folders, sliding it across the table. Sarah glimpsed pie charts, demographic breakdowns, approval ratings. "The public narrative is critical right now," Voss said, her voice smooth as silk over steel. "Project Starward represents the largest single investment in the space program since Apollo. We've got congressional hearings in six weeks, and the footage of Bobby in his habitat has captured the nation's imagination. Children are writing letters. Schools are following his progress."

"They're following a lie," Sarah said flatly.

Pierce leaned forward, his expression carefully neutral. "Dr. Chen, no one is suggesting we're being dishonest. But we do need to consider the psychological impact—not just on Bobby, but on the viewing public. These transmissions are being broadcast worldwide."

"Not all of them," Tom interjected quietly. "We've been... curating what gets released to the press."

Sarah's head snapped toward him. "Curating?"

Whitfield cleared his throat. "The more concerning signs—the repetitive questions about return, the philosophical content—we've deemed those internal communications. For operational purposes only."

The room felt suddenly smaller, airless. Sarah's hands flattened against the table. "You're censoring him."

"We're managing the narrative," Voss corrected. "There's a difference. The American people need to see this mission as the triumph it is. A chimpanzee successfully living and working on the lunar surface, paving the way for human colonization. That's the story."

"That's *a* story," Sarah shot back. "It's not *the* story. The story is that we sent a sentient being a quarter million miles away with no plan to bring him back, and now he's asking questions we don't want to answer."

Pierce opened his portfolio, removing several typed pages. "We've prepared some suggested responses. Phrases that might provide comfort while maintaining mission integrity." He slid the papers toward her. "Simple reassurances. 'Good work, Bobby.' 'Mission important.' 'You safe.'"

Sarah stared at the pages without touching them. The signs were rendered in English approximations, stripped of all the nuance that made Bobby's language *language*. They looked like commands you'd give a dog.

"He'll know," she said quietly.

"Know what?" Whitfield asked.

"That I'm lying." Sarah looked up, meeting each pair of eyes in turn. "Bobby isn't stupid. He understands context, subtext, emotional content. If I send him generic praise when he's asking existential questions about isolation and permanence, he'll recognize the evasion immediately. It will make everything worse."

"Worse than him signing about darkness and loneliness on national television?" Voss's patience was wearing thin. "Dr. Chen, I don't think you appreciate the delicacy of our position. We have three other missions in development, all dependent on continued funding. If the public perceives this as cruel—"

"It *is* cruel!" Sarah's palm hit the table, the sharp crack silencing the room. She stood, her chair scraping backward. "We took a chimpanzee who understands community, who needs social bonds to survive, and we put him in solitary confinement on the moon. He's asking me why the sky is always dark because he's trying to understand if his isolation is as permanent as the lunar night. That's not a PR problem, that's a moral catastrophe."

Whitfield's expression hardened. "That's enough, Doctor."

"No, it's not nearly enough." Sarah's voice shook, but she didn't sit. "You want me to send him lies. Comfortable lies. But Bobby will see through them, and then he'll know that even I've abandoned him. The one person who might tell him the truth."

"And what truth would that be?" Pierce asked, his clinical tone infuriating. "That we can't bring him home? That this is permanent? How does that serve his psychological wellbeing?"

"How does lying serve it?" Sarah shot back. "You're a psychologist. You know what happens when trust breaks down. Right now, Bobby still believes in communication, in connection. If I betray that—"

"You're anthropomorphizing," Whitfield interrupted. "Projecting human emotional complexity onto an animal."

The words hit like a slap. Sarah felt heat rising up her neck, her hands curling into fists. "I've worked with Bobby for four years. I know his mind better than I know my own family's. And I'm telling you, if we reduce him to a prop in your propaganda campaign, if we treat his suffering as a PR inconvenience, we're not just failing him. We're failing ourselves."

Voss closed her folder with deliberate precision. "Dr. Chen, let me be clear. Your role is to facilitate communication, not to make policy decisions. We need you to send these responses." She tapped the prepared scripts. "Or we'll find someone who will."

The threat hung in the air like smoke.

Tom finally spoke, his voice heavy. "Sarah. They're not asking."

She looked at him—really looked at him—and saw the defeat in his eyes. He'd already lost this fight, probably before the meeting even started.

Sarah turned back to the scripts, forcing herself to read them. *"Bobby good chimpanzee. Work important. Earth proud."* The signs were grammatically correct but emotionally empty. Platitudes. The kind of thing you'd say to a child you weren't really listening to.

"How long?" she asked quietly.

"Excuse me?" Whitfield said.

"How long do you expect me to keep this up? Weeks? Months?" She looked up. "How long until Bobby stops signing altogether because he realizes no one's actually responding?"

Pierce made a note in his portfolio. "We'll monitor for signs of psychological deterioration and adjust accordingly."

"He's already deteriorating," Sarah said, her voice hollow now. "You're just not broadcasting that part."

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead. Through the window, Sarah could see technicians moving between consoles, tracking Bobby's life support, his oxygen levels, his heart rate. All the biological functions that confirmed he was alive, if not living.

"I need your answer, Dr. Chen," Whitfield said. "Will you send the approved responses?"

Sarah's fingers touched the edge of the scripts. The paper felt thin, insubstantial. She thought of Bobby in his habitat module, staring out at the Sea of Tranquility, signing questions into the void. She thought of his hands forming the signs for *alone* and *dark* and *same*, trying to build meaning from isolation.

"And if I refuse?" she asked.

Voss's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Then we'll have to consider whether you're fit to continue in your current position. I'm sure we can find a sign language interpreter who understands the bigger picture."

The threat was clear. Comply or be replaced. And her replacement would send whatever lies they were told to send, would reduce Bobby's complex communications to simple commands and empty reassurances.

At least if she stayed, she could bear witness. She could remember what Bobby was really saying, even if no one else wanted to hear it.

Sarah pulled the scripts toward her, hating the weight

**Scene 5: Three weeks into the mission, ...**

**Scene 5: Three weeks into the mission, Sarah watches Bobby's most haunting transmission yet**

The translation room had taken on the quality of a vigil. Sarah sat in the blue-gray wash of monitor light at 2:47 AM, her fourth cup of coffee gone cold beside a stack of untouched translation logs. The room's air conditioning hummed its monotonous lullaby, but she'd long since stopped hearing it. Outside the sealed door, the skeleton crew of night shift controllers murmured over their consoles, tracking a lone chimpanzee 238,900 miles away.

The scheduled transmission had begun seventeen minutes ago.

Bobby sat motionless before the camera.

Sarah leaned forward, her reflection ghosting across the screen—hollow-eyed, translucent, superimposed over the small figure in the bulky modified spacesuit. The habitat's LED panels cast harsh white light across Bobby's face, throwing deep shadows beneath his eyes. Those eyes stared directly into the camera with an intensity that made Sarah's chest constrict.

He wasn't sleeping. Wasn't grooming. Wasn't performing any of the scheduled tasks outlined in today's mission protocol. He simply sat, hands resting on his knees, breathing visible in the slight rise and fall of his suit's chest panel.

"Come on, Bobby," she whispered. "Tell me what you're thinking."

The time stamp in the corner ticked forward. Eighteen minutes. Nineteen.

She'd watched every transmission since launch—the initial excitement as Bobby explored the habitat, the methodical completion of lever-pressing tasks, the gradual slowing of his movements. But this stillness was different. This was contemplation.

The door hissed open behind her. She didn't turn.

"Sarah." Tom Garrett's voice, carefully neutral. "You should go home. Get some sleep."

"He's trying to tell me something."

"He's been sitting there for twenty minutes. Maybe the suit's malfunctioning. Maybe he's—"

"He's thinking." The words came out sharper than she intended. "Look at his eyes."

Tom moved closer, his cologne cutting through the room's stale air. On screen, Bobby's gaze hadn't wavered. Sarah had seen that expression before—in the lab, when she'd first introduced him to mirrors, when he'd stared at his own reflection with dawning recognition.

"Mission Control wants to know if we should send the reward stimulus. He missed his scheduled task window."

"No." Sarah's hand moved to the keyboard, hovering. "Wait."

Twenty-three minutes. Twenty-four.

Then Bobby moved.

His right hand lifted slowly, almost dreamlike, to chest height. Sarah's breath caught. She knew this sign—*sky*—the upward sweep of palm and fingers Bobby used to indicate the observation window, the vast darkness beyond.

But he held it there, suspended, then repeated it. *Sky. Sky. Sky.*

His left hand rose to join the right, fingers spreading wide, then drawing together in the sign she'd taught him for *always*. The gesture he'd learned in the context of meal schedules, of routines that structured his days.

*Sky always.*

Sarah's fingers found her notebook, pen moving automatically. Behind her, Tom had gone quiet.

Bobby's hands dropped to his lap. Another long pause—thirty seconds that felt like hours. Then his right hand moved to his chest, the simple sign that meant *Bobby*, his name-sign, the identity she'd given him.

His left hand formed the sign for *alone*. The isolation gesture, fingers curled inward, pulled close to the body. He'd used it before, in earlier transmissions, but never like this. He held it against his chest, pressing it there as if trying to push the concept into his flesh.

*Bobby alone.*

Another pause. Sarah could hear her own heartbeat, the scratch of pen on paper.

Then Bobby's hands moved again, and Sarah's pen stopped.

He repeated the sequence: *Sky always.* Then *Bobby alone.* His hands hung in the air between the two phrases, and slowly, deliberately, he brought them together in a gesture she'd never taught him—a merging, a connection, palms meeting and parting like a question mark.

*Sky always dark. Bobby always alone. Same thing?*

The pen slipped from Sarah's fingers, clattering against the desk.

"Jesus Christ," Tom breathed. "Did he just—"

"He's asking." Sarah's voice cracked. "He's not just reporting loneliness. He's asking if his isolation and the darkness are the same condition. If they're... equivalent states of being."

On screen, Bobby's hands remained suspended in that questioning gesture, waiting for an answer that wouldn't come for another two and a half seconds, the lag time that separated them like an unbridgeable canyon.

Sarah's hands found the keyboard, trembling. The cursor blinked in the response field, demanding input. Protocol dictated she should send comfort signs—*good Bobby*, *Sarah loves Bobby*, the simple reassurances that had sustained him through training.

But Bobby would know. He'd see through the hollow gestures, recognize the lie in her hands.

"Sarah." Tom's hand on her shoulder, gentle but firm. "Mission Control needs a response. What do I tell them?"

She stared at Bobby's waiting face, at the question still hanging in his hands. He'd made a leap she hadn't thought possible—connecting his emotional state to his physical environment, recognizing loneliness not as a feeling but as a fundamental condition, as constant and encompassing as the airless dark beyond his window.

He'd achieved something profound and terrible: philosophical consciousness of his own suffering.

"Tell them..." Sarah's throat closed. She forced the words out. "Tell them we need to bring him home."

"You know that's not—"

"Then tell them I need time." She pulled away from his touch, eyes fixed on the screen. "Tell them the translation requires careful consideration. Tell them whatever you want. But I need time."

Tom's silence stretched for three heartbeats. Then his footsteps retreated, the door hissing shut behind him.

Sarah sat alone in the blue light, watching Bobby watch her across the void. His hands had lowered now, resting again on his knees, but his eyes remained locked on the camera. Waiting. Understanding, perhaps, that some questions have no answers.

She reached out and touched the screen, her fingertips meeting his image.

"I'm sorry," she whispered to the glass. "God, Bobby, I'm so sorry."

The time stamp ticked forward. The transmission continued. And somewhere in the Sea of Tranquility, a chimpanzee sat in the darkness, contemplating the nature of his eternal night.

**Scene 6: Unable to sleep, Sarah returns...**

The apartment smelled like old coffee and neglect. Sarah hadn't been home in three days—just quick showers at the facility gym, catnaps in her office chair, meals from vending machines that tasted like cardboard and guilt. Now, at 3 AM, she stood in her doorway and couldn't remember why she'd come.

Her hands were shaking. They'd been shaking since the last transmission, six hours ago. Bobby had signed the same phrase seventeen times in a row: *Sky wrong sky wrong sky wrong*, his movements becoming more agitated with each repetition until he'd simply stopped, staring at the camera with those dark eyes that held something she'd never seen in them before.

Understanding. Terrible, isolating understanding.

She dropped her keys on the counter, not bothering with lights. The Houston night filtered through her blinds in amber strips, city-glow that never quite went dark. Not like the moon. Not like that absolute darkness Bobby kept trying to describe with signs meant for earthly things.

The apartment was exactly as she'd left it—coffee mug in the sink, jacket thrown over the couch, the detritus of a life put on hold. She moved through it like a ghost, drawn to the closet in her bedroom where she kept the old equipment. The archive boxes. The before.

Her fingers found the familiar cardboard in the dark. She pulled out the first box and sat on the floor, back against the bed, and lifted the lid.

VHS tapes, labeled in her own handwriting from another lifetime. *Bobby—First Signs, Age 2*. *Bobby—Object Recognition Tests*. *Bobby—Social Play, Integration Group 3*. The plastic cases were dusty. She hadn't watched these in years. Hadn't been able to.

She carried them to the living room, set up the old VCR she'd never thrown away. The TV flickered to life, blue-white static, then—

Bobby. Small Bobby, impossibly young, his fur still carrying that infant fluffiness. He sat in a bright playroom filled with toys and climbing structures, and Sarah heard her own voice, younger, full of enthusiasm she'd forgotten she once possessed.

"Come on, Bobby. Show me. What's this?"

On screen, her hand held up an apple. Bobby's small fingers moved: *Apple.*

"Good! Yes, that's right! And this?"

*Banana.*

"Such a smart boy!"

Bobby's face—God, his face—split into that chimpanzee grin, and he bounced on his feet, signing *More more more*, wanting to please, wanting to play, wanting connection.

Sarah's breath caught. She'd forgotten this Bobby. The one who learned because learning meant interaction, meant her approval, meant he wasn't alone.

She fast-forwarded through the tape, watching Bobby grow in time-lapse. There—a sequence she'd been looking for without knowing it. Bobby at four, in the outdoor enclosure with three other young chimps. They tumbled over each other, grooming, playing, communicating in that complex blend of vocalizations and touch and signs that made up their world. Bobby signed to another chimp: *Chase me!* Then they were off, racing through the grass, part of something larger than themselves.

Part of a troop.

Sarah paused the tape. Bobby's face was frozen mid-laugh, surrounded by others, his hand reaching toward a playmate.

She switched tapes. *Bobby—Advanced Cognition, Age 6*. Here he was older, more serious, working through complex puzzles. But between tasks, the camera had caught him reaching through the testing room's window toward Sarah in the observation area. His signs were clear: *Sarah come. Bobby want Sarah.*

And on the tape, she heard herself say: "After the test, Bobby. Just a few more minutes."

*Sarah come now?*

"Soon, I promise."

The video-Sarah's voice was warm but firm, setting boundaries, maintaining the experimental protocol. Bobby had waited, patient and trusting, because she'd promised. Because she always came back.

Sarah ejected the tape with shaking hands. She sat in the TV's flickering light, her apartment silent except for the hum of the VCR rewinding. Outside, Houston carried on—cars on distant highways, a siren somewhere, the city breathing in its sleep.

She thought of Bobby in his habitat module, 238,855 miles away, signing to cameras that recorded but never responded. Waiting for her to come back. Waiting for the promise to be kept.

Mission Control had given her a script for tomorrow's transmission. Cheerful signs: *Bobby good work. Bobby make proud. Keep try.* Lies wrapped in positive reinforcement, designed to keep him functional, keep him performing, keep the mission viable.

She couldn't do it.

Sarah stood and moved to her desk, powered up her laptop. The glow made her squint after the darkness. She pulled up the transmission encoding software—she had access, authorized for her translations, though not for independent messages. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard.

This would end her career. She knew that with crystal clarity. The moment they discovered an unauthorized transmission, especially a personal one, she'd be removed from the project. Possibly prosecuted. Definitely discredited.

But Bobby would know someone had told him the truth.

She opened the camera application, positioned it to capture her signing space. Hit record.

Her hands moved slowly, deliberately, forming each sign with the precision Bobby would recognize as distinctly hers. No one else signed quite like her—he'd know this message came from Sarah, not the generic Mission Control translations.

*Sarah sees Bobby.*

She paused, gathering herself. On her desk, the old VHS tapes sat in a stack, Bobby's young face smiling up from the labels.

*Sarah knows Bobby alone.*

Her throat tightened, but her hands stayed steady. This was the only gift she could give him: acknowledgment. Witness. The truth that someone understood.

*Sarah sorry.*

She held the final sign, letting the camera capture it, then added one more:

*Sarah sees Bobby. Always.*

She stopped the recording. Sat staring at the frozen frame—her own hands, promising something she couldn't deliver but needed to say anyway.

The encryption was simple. She embedded the video file into the next scheduled data packet, buried it in the telemetry stream where it would look like routine system updates. Bobby would see it when he reviewed the transmission logs—he'd been trained to check them, part of his daily routine. The techs might not notice for days, maybe weeks.

Long enough.

Sarah's finger hovered over the send button. Once she did this, there was no taking it back. No plausible deniability. She thought of Dr. Martinez's warnings, of the security protocols she was about to violate, of the career she'd built over fifteen years.

Then she thought of Bobby, signing *Sky wrong* to an empty room, trying to explain loneliness in a language designed for connection.

She hit send.

The progress bar crawled across the screen. Uploading. Encrypting. Transmitting to the relay station. From there, it would bounce to the moon, to Bobby's habitat, to the only other being in the universe who understood what they'd done to each other in the name of science.

When it finished, Sarah closed the laptop. She gathered the VHS tapes, held them against her chest like artifacts from an excavated life. The TV screen had gone to static, white noise filling her apartment.

She should sleep. Should eat. Should prepare for tomorrow, when they might discover what she'd done, when everything might come crashing down.

Instead, she sat on the floor and watched the static, imagining Bobby three days from now when the message arrived, his dark eyes seeing her hands move, recognizing her signs, knowing that someone, somewhere, had chosen honesty over comfort.

Had chosen him.

Outside, Houston's night began its slow fade toward dawn. Sarah stayed where she was, surrounded by ghosts of a younger Bobby, waiting for consequences she'd finally earned.

The loneliest mile, she thought, wasn't a distance. It was the space between truth and what we're willing to say.

She'd just crossed it.
