        "name": "Percy 'The Swine-King' Pigsworth",
        "age": "Technically, six months (pig years are complicated)",
        "physical_description": "Percy is a pot-bellied pig with a surprisingly refined snout and soulful, almost human-like eyes. His coat is a mix of pink and black splotches, and he's surprisingly muscular for a pig destined for the butcher. He's initially covered in mud and farm dirt, but Daisy later cleans him up and even sews him a tiny white jumpsuit with miniature rhinestones, inspired by Elvis's iconic stage outfits. He also sports a pair of blue suede shoes (modified baby shoes) that Daisy crafts for him.",
        "personality_traits": "Resourceful, Cautious, Determined",
        "background": "Percy was born on a large-scale pig farm in rural Iowa, the result of experimental genetic modification. This modification unexpectedly granted him an exceptional vocal range and an uncanny ability to mimic Elvis Presley's singing style. Growing up amongst hundreds of identical pigs, Percy always felt different, drawn to the faint signals of oldies radio that drifted across the farm. He yearned for a life beyond the mud and the inevitable slaughterhouse.",
        "motivations": "Percy is driven by a desire to escape his predetermined fate and find a place where his unique talent is appreciated. He wants to experience a life of fame, freedom, and, most importantly, to avoid becoming bacon.",

        "internal_conflicts": "Percy struggles with feelings of self-doubt and vulnerability. He questions whether he's good enough to succeed as an entertainer and worries about being rejected or exploited. He also grapples with the guilt of leaving his fellow pigs behind on the farm.",
        "external_conflicts": "Percy faces the challenge of navigating the unfamiliar world of Memphis, dealing with the competitive Elvis impersonator scene, and evading Farmer Jed, who is relentlessly pursuing him.",
