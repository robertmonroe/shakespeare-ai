    "worldbuilding": {
        "geography": "The story takes place primarily in the bustling metropolis of Brickell City, a fictional city inspired by a blend of New York City and Miami. Brickell City is situated on a large peninsula, bordered by a vast, shimmering bay on one side and sprawling suburban landscapes extending inland on the other. The climate is humid subtropical, characterized by hot, humid summers and mild, pleasant winters. Rainfall is abundant, especially during the summer months when thunderstorms are frequent. The city itself is a concrete jungle, with towering skyscrapers piercing the sky and crowded streets teeming with life. Central Park-esque 'Greenhaven Park' provides a pocket of natural escape amidst the urban sprawl, while the waterfront area features picturesque marinas and boardwalks. Beyond the city limits, rolling hills give way to the fertile farmland where Arnie originates. These farms are dotted with small towns and provide a stark contrast to the high-energy, fast-paced environment of Brickell City. The landscape shifts further inland, gradually transitioning into a more rural, forested region. Johnny's parents specifically were looking at farms in 'Green Valley' a small town that boasts several family-run businesses.",
        "culture_and_society": "Brickell City's culture is a vibrant melting pot, influenced by a diverse population of immigrants and long-time residents. The city is known for its fast-paced lifestyle, where ambition and success are highly valued. A strong emphasis is placed on career advancement and material possessions. The social structure is hierarchical, with distinct class divisions visible in the different neighborhoods and lifestyles. Family remains an important value, although the demands of city life often place a strain on family relationships. The pursuit of happiness and fulfillment is a common theme, with many residents seeking escape from the pressures of urban living. Art and entertainment play a significant role in the city's culture, with numerous theaters, museums, and music venues. While generally tolerant, there can be a sense of disconnect between city dwellers and those living in more rural areas, leading to misunderstandings and prejudices. This is partially evident when Johnny tries to explain his pet pig Arnie to his peers.",
        "history": "Brickell City began as a small trading post in the 18th century, gradually growing into a major commercial hub due to its strategic location and natural harbor. The 19th century saw rapid industrialization and immigration, transforming the city into a manufacturing powerhouse. The early 20th century was marked by economic booms and busts, as well as significant social and political changes. During the mid-20th century, Brickell City experienced a period of urban renewal, with the construction of modern skyscrapers and infrastructure. In recent decades, the city has become a global center for finance, technology, and tourism. A significant turning point in the city's history was the Great Urban Fire of 1932, which destroyed a large portion of the downtown area and led to stricter building codes and fire safety regulations. This disaster also fostered a sense of community and resilience among the city's residents. More recently, increased awareness of environmental issues has led to efforts to promote sustainable development and reduce the city's carbon footprint. The expansion of farming and agriculture in the outer reaches of the city has also had its effect.",
        "rules_and_laws": "Brickell City operates under a mayoral system, with an elected mayor serving as the chief executive officer. The city council is responsible for enacting laws and policies, while the court system interprets and enforces those laws. The legal system is based on a combination of common law and statutory law. Animal control ordinances are strict, prohibiting farm animals from being kept within city limits due to health and safety concerns. Public order is maintained by the Brickell City Police Department, which is responsible for law enforcement and crime prevention. The city also has a strong emphasis on property rights and contracts. Regulations regarding zoning and land use are complex and often controversial, particularly in areas undergoing rapid development. Penalties for breaking the law range from fines and community service to imprisonment, depending on the severity of the offense. The police force is known for its efficiency but can sometimes be perceived as impersonal and bureaucratic. There is also a strong sense of civic duty among many residents, who actively participate in local government and community organizations.",
        "technology_level": "Brickell City boasts a highly advanced technological infrastructure, with widespread access to the internet, smartphones, and other digital devices. The city is a hub for technology companies and startups, driving innovation in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and biotechnology. Transportation is heavily reliant on automobiles, but the city also has an extensive public transportation system, including subways, buses, and light rail lines. High-speed trains connect Brickell City to other major cities in the region. Medical technology is state-of-the-art, with advanced diagnostic equipment and treatment options available at leading hospitals and research institutions. The city's infrastructure is also equipped with smart technology, such as sensors that monitor traffic flow, air quality, and energy consumption. However, this advanced technology also comes with its own set of challenges, including cybersecurity threats, privacy concerns, and the digital divide. The use of drones for delivery and surveillance is becoming increasingly common, raising ethical questions about their impact on society.",

The Farmstead district outside the main city center is the hub of animal agriculture. Within the city, Johnny's apartment building is a high-rise complex known for its modern amenities and strict rules. Arnie's original farm is a family-owned operation called 'Green Pastures Farm,' which emphasizes sustainable farming practices and humane treatment of animals. The old abandoned train yard just outside the city becomes a safe haven for Johnny and Arnie as they temporarily hide before being discovered by authorities.",
