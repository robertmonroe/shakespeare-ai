**Scene 1: The story continues with new developments**

The rain fell sideways in Neo-London, driven by winds that howled through the skeletal remains of the old city's towers. Shade pressed her back against the cold metal of a ventilation shaft, her breath forming small clouds that the wind snatched away before they could betray her position.

Below, three stories down, the Enforcers swept their searchlights across the rooftop gardens of Sector Seven. The beams cut through the darkness like hungry predators, seeking any sign of movement among the hydroponic rows and rusted solar panels.

*Stupid*, she thought, her fingers tightening around the data chip in her pocket. *Should have taken the tunnels.*

But the tunnels meant going through Reaper territory, and after what happened to Marcus last week, that wasn't an option anymore. Not for anyone carrying something this valuable.

The chip felt impossibly small for something that could bring down the Pantheon. Three grams of encrypted data—names, locations, the truth about what really happened during the Ascension. The kind of truth that got people disappeared.

A searchlight swung toward her position. Shade held her breath, pressing herself flatter against the shaft until the rivets dug into her spine. The light passed inches from her boots, illuminating the graffiti someone had tagged across the metal: *GODS BLEED TOO*.

She'd seen that symbol everywhere lately. Spray-painted on walls, scratched into elevator doors, even burned into the synthetic grass of the memorial gardens. The resistance was growing bolder, more desperate. More reckless.

*Like me*, she admitted.

The light moved on. Shade counted to thirty before allowing herself to breathe again.

Her earpiece crackled. "Shade, you copy?" Dex's voice was barely a whisper, distorted by the encryption software that kept their communications hidden from Pantheon surveillance.

She tapped twice on the receiver. *Yes*.

"They're moving a patrol to the north stairwell. You've got maybe four minutes before they lock down the whole sector."

Four minutes. She glanced at the gap between her building and the next—a twenty-foot jump across open air, with nothing but a hundred-foot drop to the flooded streets below.

The old Shade would have hesitated. The old Shade would have looked for another way.

But the old Shade hadn't watched her mother dragged away by Enforcers. Hadn't spent three years surviving in the Undercity, learning that hesitation was just another word for death.

She ran.

The wind screamed in her ears as she sprinted toward the edge. Her feet found the lip of the roof, and then there was nothing beneath her but rain and darkness and the distant glow of the Pantheon's spire, that massive tower of light and lies that dominated the city's skyline.

For one eternal second, she flew.

Then her hands caught the rusted railing of the opposite building, and the impact nearly tore her arms from their sockets. She swung, momentum carrying her forward, and tumbled onto the rooftop in a graceless roll that left her gasping on the wet concrete.

Behind her, a searchlight found the spot where she'd been standing.

"Shade?" Dex's voice again, urgent now.

She tapped the receiver once. *I'm okay*.

But as she pushed herself to her feet and started running again, she knew that was a lie. Nothing about this was okay. Nothing about this world, where the powerful called themselves gods and everyone else just tried to survive another day.

The data chip pressed against her thigh like a promise.

*Soon*, she thought, leaping to the next rooftop as alarms began to wail behind her. *Soon they'll learn that gods can fall too.*

The rain swallowed her shadow as she disappeared into the maze of Neo-London's upper levels, carrying secrets that could change everything—or get her killed trying.

Three blocks away, in the gleaming sanctuary of the Pantheon spire, someone was already watching her progress on a screen.

And smiling.
