## Chapter 3: The Decree of Extinction

### Scene 1: The Decree

The Hall of Eternal Stars stretched before Inanna, its vaulted ceiling studded with holographic constellations. Ten thousand years of conquest glittered overhead—each light a world subjugated, a civilization reduced to ore.

She stood among the nobility, ceremonial robes heavier than armor. Below, her father's throne rose like an explosion of gold. King Anu sat upon it, ancient and terrible.

*He's already decided*, she realized. *This is theater.*

Through the transparent floor, Earth turned in slow majesty. She could see Mesopotamia—that cradle of civilization where she'd walked among humans, learned their names, tasted their wine.

"The question before us," Anu's amplified voice rolled through the hall, "is not whether the human experiment has failed. That is beyond dispute."

Murmurs of agreement. Inanna kept her face neutral, nails cutting crescents into her palms.

"The question is how we correct the contamination."

Holographic Earth materialized beside the throne. The view zoomed to settlements along river valleys. Children playing. Grain fields golden in the sun.

"The Council of Twelve has reviewed the assessment," Anu announced. "Humanity's capacity for innovation has exceeded all models. By authority of the First Compact, I hereby decree: the human experiment is terminated."

He gestured. Displays illuminated the parameters of Project Deluge.

"Security Commander Enlil will outline the procedure."

Enlil strode forward, boots striking the dais. "Project Deluge represents three centuries of contingency planning."

The display animated.

"Phase One: The Genetic Cascade. Activation signal broadcast globally within fourteen days. Sixty-three percent of humans carry the kill-switch gene. Initial mortality: sixty-three percent."

A wave of invisible death propagated across the holographic Earth.

"Phase Two: The Deluge. Orbital platforms redirect energy to polar ice sheets, triggering cascading melt. Sea levels rise one hundred meters within two weeks."

The holographic continents shrank beneath spreading blue.

"Survivors face starvation, exposure, and the predatory megafauna we've seeded in mountain regions." Enlil's voice rose with triumph. "Combined mortality: ninety-five percent. Extinction achieved within the quarter-cycle."

*Fourteen days*, Inanna thought. *Fifteen million souls.*

"All specimens eliminated," Anu declared. "The cleansing commences at next orbital alignment—fourteen days hence."

He raised his scepter and struck it against the throne. Thunder echoed.

"So it is spoken. So it shall be done."

The hall erupted in applause.

Inanna forced her hands to move, miming celebration while her heart turned to ice.

### Scene 2: The Thread of Hope

Later, in her private chambers, Inanna knelt before her mother's holographic projection. The encrypted transmission flickered across light-years.

"Daughter." Antu's voice was soft. "Your father's course is set."

"I know. I was there." Inanna's voice shook. "I cannot watch them be eradicated for the crime of *potential*."

"You understand the consequences of disobedience?"

"Perfectly. But I also understand the consequences of compliance."

Silence stretched between them.

Finally, Antu spoke. "The jungle remembers."

The hologram flickered. Within the distortion, coordinates flashed: 21°18′N 72°50′E.

"Seek the forgotten places, Inanna. There are those who live beyond our control. Find them before the fire falls."

The transmission ended.

Inanna stared at the empty air. A wild hope kindled in her chest.

The jungle remembered.

And she would make sure it survived.

### Scene 3: Flight from the Sky

The scout ship's engines screamed as Inanna fought the atmospheric drag.

Behind her, the orbital station was already mobilizing pursuit craft. She'd had help—Zael, a sympathetic technician who believed the Adamu deserved better than extinction. He'd bought her an hour by scrambling launch protocols.

An hour was all she needed.

The blue-green planet filled her viewport, growing larger by the second. She could see cloud patterns now, the brown-green smear of continents, the glitter of sunlight on oceans.

*I'm coming*, she thought. *Hold on.*

Warning lights screamed. The heat shielding was failing. She'd pushed the scout ship beyond its design limits, but she was committed now.

Earth or death.

There was no going back.

### Scene 4: A World Untamed

The jungle swallowed her.

Inanna stood in the wreckage of her ship, surrounded by vegetation so thick it blocked the sky. The air was hot, humid, alive with sounds she couldn't identify—bird calls, insect drones, the distant crash of something large moving through undergrowth.

Her neural interface tried to catalog the stimuli and failed.

*Too much*, it reported. *Sensory overload. Recommend withdrawal to controlled environment.*

There was no controlled environment. Not anymore.

She'd escaped the orbital station. She'd survived atmospheric entry. She'd crashed in the deepest, most inaccessible wilderness on the planet.

Now came the hard part.

She had to find a legend—a wild man raised by apes, spoken of in whispers even among the enslaved Adamu. The one they called Tarzan.

*Thirteen days*, she reminded herself. *Thirteen days until the fire falls.*

Inanna shouldered the emergency pack she'd salvaged from the wreckage, chose a direction that felt marginally less impassable than the others, and began to walk.

The jungle watched her pass. It had seen many strange things in its ancient existence.

But it had never seen anything quite like her.
