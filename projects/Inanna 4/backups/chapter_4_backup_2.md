## Chapter 4: Flight and Fire

**Scene 1: Inanna navigates through the orbital corridors**

The maintenance cycle had begun seventeen minutes ago. Inanna counted each second like a heartbeat, her internal chronometer synced to the station's rhythms as intimately as her own pulse.

The corridor stretched before her, bathed in the amber glow of reduced power mode. Every third lighting panel had dimmed to conservation levels, casting long shadows across the burnished walls that seemed to breathe with the station's mechanical respiration. The air recyclers hummed at half capacity—a low, drowsy frequency that vibrated through the deck plating beneath her feet.

She walked with purpose, but not haste. Haste drew eyes.

Her ceremonial robes had been exchanged for a technician's utilitarian jumpsuit, the fabric a dull silver that absorbed the amber light rather than reflecting it. The garment hung loose on her frame, designed for the broader shoulders of the engineering caste, but it served its purpose. From a distance, in this light, she was simply another worker attending to routine tasks.

The weight of the access cylinder pressed against her thigh through the hidden pocket she'd sewn into the suit's lining three cycles ago. Royal clearance codes. Her father's codes, technically—duplicated during a moment of distraction when he'd been reviewing fleet deployments and she'd been playing the role of dutiful daughter, bringing him fermented nectar and asking innocent questions about Earth's mineral yields.

*Treason*, whispered a voice in her mind that sounded remarkably like Enlil's cold rasp. *What you carry is treason.*

She silenced it with a memory: the holographic projection of Earth's projected timeline, the cascading failures mapped in crimson fractals across the planet's surface. Ninety-three cycles. That was all the time the primitives had before the Cleansing began—the floods and the genetic kill switch that would erase them from existence. Ninety-three cycles, and the Council had voted to let them burn.

Her boots made soft sounds against the corridor floor—a synthetic material designed to dampen vibration and mask movement during rest periods. The Anunnaki had engineered their vessels for efficiency in all things, including silence. Now that engineering served her purpose instead of theirs.

A junction approached. Inanna slowed, pressing herself against the curved wall as she consulted the mental map she'd constructed over months of careful observation. Left led to the primary engineering hub, where a skeleton crew would be running diagnostics on the atmospheric processors. Right descended toward the cargo holds and, beyond them, the reconnaissance pod bay.

Voices echoed from somewhere ahead—the guttural consonants of technical jargon exchanged between workers. Inanna held her breath, counting the syllables, parsing the conversation.

"—fluctuation in the tertiary coupling. Probably just thermal drift."

"Log it anyway. Commander Enlil reviews every anomaly personally since the incident at the mining colony."

The mention of Enlil sent ice through her veins. Enlil, her father's security commander, had intensified his paranoia since a primitive had somehow damaged an extraction drill before being neutralized. He saw sabotage in every shadow now, conspiracy in every malfunction.

*He's not wrong*, Inanna thought grimly. *Just looking in the wrong direction.*

She waited until the voices faded, then moved. The junction's sensor array would log her passage, but the technician's credentials she'd borrowed—from a worker currently sedated in the medical bay after an "accidental" exposure to soporific compounds—would show nothing unusual. Just another drone attending to another task.

The corridor curved downward, following the station's rotating geometry. Gravity shifted subtly beneath her feet as she descended toward the outer rings, where centrifugal force supplemented the artificial field generators. The air grew cooler here, carrying the metallic tang of hull proximity—that particular scent of vacuum kept at bay by meters of reinforced alloy.

Through a viewport, Earth swung into view.

Inanna stopped despite herself, despite the countdown running in her mind, despite everything.

The planet hung in the darkness like a jewel of impossible blue, swirled with white cloud formations that moved in patterns she had memorized from a thousand orbital observations. She could see the nightside edge where primitive fires flickered in scattered clusters—the humans, gathering against the dark as they had for millennia, never knowing that greater fires were coming.

*I'm sorry*, she thought, pressing her palm against the cold viewport. *I'm sorry we found you. I'm sorry for what we've taken. I'm sorry for what's coming.*

But sorry changed nothing. Only action could do that.

She turned from the viewport and continued her descent.

The docking bay access required three separate authentication protocols. Inanna's fingers trembled as she inserted the access cylinder into the first reader, watching the indicator lights cycle through verification sequences. Green. The cylinder contained valid codes.

Second reader. A biometric scan that should have rejected her immediately—but the scanner had been experiencing "intermittent failures" for the past five cycles, ever since she'd introduced a microscopic corruption into its calibration matrix. It flickered, stuttered, and defaulted to the backup protocol: voice confirmation.

"Technician Ashur, reporting for pod maintenance inspection."

The thin adhesive strip she wore against her throat—purchased from the black markets of the lower decks with jewels pried from her own ceremonial headdress—transformed her words into a reasonable approximation of the sedated worker's baritone. The device was temporary, a piece of contraband technology designed for covert operations among the lower castes. She had pressed it into place in the privacy of her quarters, where even Anunnaki surveillance could not penetrate royal privacy protocols.

Green.

Third reader. This one required the cylinder again, but with a secondary encryption key that changed every maintenance cycle. Inanna had spent six cycles cultivating a relationship with a lonely signals officer, listening to his complaints about his superiors, laughing at his attempts at humor, until he'd trusted her enough to complain about the "absurd" security protocols and the "ridiculous" algorithm that generated the encryption keys.

She'd memorized the algorithm. Calculated tonight's key during her evening meditation, while her attendants assumed she was communing with the ancestors.

The cylinder slid home. The indicator light pulsed amber—thinking, processing, deciding her fate.

*Please*, she thought, though she had stopped believing in the gods her people claimed to be long ago. *Please.*

Green.

The door irised open, revealing the docking bay beyond.

It was smaller than the primary hangar—a maintenance facility rather than a launch complex, holding perhaps a dozen reconnaissance pods in various states of repair. The vessels crouched in their berths like sleeping predators, their hulls gleaming dully in the emergency lighting. Most were undergoing some form of service, their access panels open to reveal the luminescent circuitry within.

But one—the third from the left, designated RP-7—sat whole and ready. Its maintenance had been completed ahead of schedule, logged as operational, and somehow overlooked when the duty roster was compiled for tonight's cycle.

Inanna had spent considerable effort ensuring that oversight.

Two technicians worked at the far end of the bay, their attention focused on a disassembled engine component that sparked and sputtered under their ministrations. They didn't look up as she entered. Why would they? She was just another worker, another cog in the great machine of Anunnaki efficiency.

She crossed the bay floor with measured steps, fighting the urge to run. The pod's access hatch was seventeen meters away. Sixteen. Fifteen.

One of the technicians laughed at something the other said—a sharp sound that made Inanna's heart stutter. But they still didn't turn. Still didn't see.

Ten meters. Five.

Her hand touched the pod's hull, and she had to bite back a sob of relief. The metal was cool beneath her palm, humming with dormant power. Inside this shell, she would either find salvation or death. There was no third option now.

The hatch recognized the access cylinder's authority and slid open with a soft hiss.

Inanna climbed inside, pulling the hatch closed behind her. The pod's interior was cramped—designed for observation rather than comfort, with a single acceleration couch surrounded by sensor displays and navigation interfaces. She settled into the couch, feeling the restraints automatically adjust to her smaller frame.

*Too small*, the system would note. *Pilot mass inconsistent with registered user.*

But by the time that anomaly was flagged, she intended to be far beyond the station's reach.

Her fingers danced across the control interface, initiating the launch sequence she had rehearsed a hundred times in her mind. Power systems: online. Navigation: plotting course for atmospheric entry. Communications: preparing the transmission she had encoded over months of sleepless nights. The message was targeted, encoded with linguistic triggers designed to reach those free human tribes scattered across the jungle and flood plains who still possessed the will to resist. It was a warning, a plea, and a promise of aid, tailored to bypass Anunnaki surveillance and ignite the spark of rebellion.

The pod's engines began their warm-up cycle, a rising whine that would be audible throughout the bay.

Through the small viewport, she saw one of the technicians look up, frowning. Saw him tap his companion's shoulder. Saw them both turn toward her pod with expressions shifting from confusion to alarm.

Inanna's hand hovered over the launch control.

*Ninety-three cycles*, she reminded herself. *Ninety-three cycles, and then fire.*

She pressed the control.

The pod screamed to life around her, magnetic clamps releasing with a thunderous clang as the launch rail seized the vessel and hurled it toward the bay doors. Alarms shrieked—Loss of containment. Unauthorized launch. Security breach—but they were already behind her, already fading as the pod punched through the emergency barrier and into the void.

Earth filled her viewport, vast and blue and burning with possibility.

The broadcast was intended for future humans and any rebel Anunnaki who might be listening.

Behind her, she knew, the station was waking to her betrayal.

Inanna angled the pod toward the atmosphere and began her descent into fire.

The heat was intense, even through the pod's ablative shielding. The G-forces pressed her deep into the acceleration couch, stealing her breath and blurring her vision. Alarms wailed incessantly, each tone a shrill reminder of the escalating crisis. Despite the chaos, Inanna clung to consciousness, her mind laser-focused on the pod's trajectory and the rapidly approaching surface.

She monitored the sensor readings, making minute adjustments to the flight path as the automated systems struggled to compensate for the damage sustained during launch. The pod bucked and shuddered violently as it tore through the atmosphere, each jolt threatening to rip it apart.

Suddenly, a deafening explosion rocked the vessel. Warning lights flashed, indicating a critical systems failure. The pod lurched violently, spinning out of control. Inanna fought to regain control, but the damage was too severe. The pod spiraled downwards, a flaming meteor hurtling towards the primordial jungle below.

Bracing herself for the inevitable impact, Inanna clenched her eyes shut and held on tight. She remained conscious, her senses overwhelmed by the roar of the wind, the screech of tearing metal, and the searing heat. She felt the pod slam into the earth with bone-jarring force, the impact throwing her against the restraints.

The world turned black, but she fought to stay awake, her mind racing, determined to survive. She felt pain, searing and all-encompassing, but beneath it, a flicker of hope remained. She was on Earth. And she was alive.

Inanna awoke to a world of pain.

Her head throbbed in time with a ringing in her ears that threatened to shatter her skull. Every muscle screamed in protest, her bones aching from the violent deceleration. The acceleration couch had done its job—preventing fatal injury—but the impact had been brutal.

Disoriented, she tried to take stock of her surroundings. The pod was a wreck. Twisted metal, shattered displays, and sparking wires filled the cramped interior. Emergency lights flickered weakly, casting dancing shadows that made it difficult to focus.

She fumbled for the release mechanism on the couch restraints, her fingers clumsy and unresponsive. It took several attempts before the clamps disengaged, allowing her to push herself upright.

A wave of nausea washed over her as she moved, and she had to fight the urge to vomit. The air was thick with the acrid smell of burning circuits and leaking fuel.

She was alive. And she was alone.

**Time Jump:** *Three days later...*

**Scene 5: Enkidu's Discovery**

[No changes]

**Scene 5: Enlil's Discovery**

Twelve thousand kilometers above, on the command bridge of the orbital station, alarms shattered the routine calm. The Nibiru orbital station, a massive structure orbiting Earth, houses key command and control facilities. Part of this structure includes the station's defensive perimeter, equipped with advanced weaponry. Within the station lies the *Throne of Heaven*, the command bridge from which high-level decisions are made.

On a raised dais at the center of the bridge, Enlil knelt before a shimmering holographic projection—a life-sized image of King Anu, his face etched with the weight of cosmic responsibility. The King’s eyes, ancient and piercing, seemed to penetrate Enlil’s very soul.

“You report the loss of a survey pod, Enlil." Anu’s voice resonated with a regal authority that brooked no dissent.

Enlil lowered his head further. “Regrettably, my King. Princess Inanna commandeered the vessel without authorization."

“Treason.” Anu steepled his fingers before him, the holographic light glinting off his silicon-enhanced skin. “Do you have proof of this ‘treason,’ beyond the unauthorized departure?”

“The Princess had acquired data pertaining to the Cleansing protocol, my King. Sensitive information that could incite rebellion among the primitives.”

Anu was silent for a long moment, his gaze fixed on the swirling cloud patterns of Earth below.

Enlil’s jaw tightened.

Anu sighed, a sound that seemed to carry the weight of millennia. “Inanna always had a… troublesome compassion. A weakness for the creatures we engineered for servitude.”

“A dangerous weakness, my King. One that could jeopardize the entire mission.”

“Perhaps.” Anu’s gaze flickered, a hint of sadness in their depths. “Or perhaps… she saw something we have forgotten.” He paused, then his voice hardened. “Regardless, the matter is closed. The Cleansing will proceed as scheduled. See to it that no further… ‘malfunctions’ occur.”

“It will be done, my King.” Enlil rose to his feet, relief washing over him. He *hoped* he had weathered the storm. For now.

The holographic projection flickered and vanished, leaving Enlil alone on the dais, the weight of his actions settling heavily upon his shoulders. He had silenced Inanna, or so he *feared*. But he knew, with a chilling certainty, that her rebellion was far from over.
