## Chapter 1: Summer of '81 and the Cemetery Meeting

**Scene 1: On a warm Texas evening in June 1981**

The Starlite Drive-In Theater shimmered like a mirage in the Texas heat, its massive screen glowing white against the deepening twilight. Robert leaned against the hood of his brother's borrowed Chevy pickup, the metal still warm beneath his palms, and tried to focus on the movie flickering above him. Something about aliens. He couldn't quite care.

The June air hung thick and sweet with the scent of honeysuckle from the fence line, mixing with popcorn butter and exhaust fumes. Around him, car speakers crackled with dialogue while couples nestled in truck beds and families spread blankets on the ground. The intermission countdown appeared on screen—five minutes—and Robert straightened, suddenly restless.

That's when he saw her.

She stood three rows over at the concession stand, bathed in the golden glow of the snack bar's neon lights. Dark hair fell past her shoulders in soft waves, and she wore a simple white sundress that caught the breeze. She was laughing at something her friend said, her whole face lighting up with it, and Robert felt something shift in his chest—a recognition of something he couldn't name.

Before he could talk himself out of it, his feet were moving.

"Excuse me," he heard himself say as he approached the counter beside her. His voice came out steadier than he felt. "Is the popcorn any good here, or should I stick with the candy?"

She turned, and up close he could see her eyes were the color of warm honey. A small smile played at the corners of her mouth. "The popcorn's always stale," she said. Her voice held the faintest trace of an accent, something musical beneath the Texas drawl. "But the Milk Duds are safe."

"Milk Duds it is, then." Robert grinned, signaling to the bored teenager behind the counter. "I'm Robert."

"Silvia." She tilted her head slightly, studying him with an openness that should have made him nervous but somehow didn't. "You're not watching the movie either?"

"Was I that obvious?"

"You looked like you were planning an escape." Her smile widened, genuine and unguarded. "I don't blame you. My friend dragged me here, but I've seen this one already."

The speaker above them announced two minutes to showtime. Around them, people began drifting back to their cars, but neither Robert nor Silvia moved. The air between them felt charged, electric, like the moment before a summer storm breaks.

"So if you're not here for the movie," Robert said, emboldened by the way she hadn't looked away, "what are you here for?"

Silvia's expression turned thoughtful. She glanced up at the darkening sky, where the first stars were beginning to appear beyond the screen's bright glow. "I like the in-between parts. When the movie stops and everyone's just... here. Together but separate. It feels like anything could happen."

Robert's heart kicked against his ribs. He'd never heard anyone put into words what he'd always felt at places like this—the possibility hanging in the warm night air, the sense that life was waiting to truly begin.

"Yeah," he said softly. "Exactly like that."

Their eyes met and held. Somewhere a car horn honked. Someone's child laughed. The intermission music faded, and the feature presentation logo appeared on screen, but Robert barely noticed. He was trying to memorize the exact shade of her eyes, the way her hair moved in the breeze, the feeling expanding in his chest that his life had just split into before and after this moment.

"I should get back," Silvia said, but she didn't move. "My friend will wonder where I am."

"Will you be here next weekend?" The words tumbled out before Robert could stop them. "They're showing something with John Travolta."

She bit her lip, and he could see her weighing something, making a decision that felt far bigger than a simple movie date. Finally, she nodded. "Saturday night?"

"Saturday night," Robert confirmed, and the smile that broke across his face felt like sunrise.

Silvia turned to go, then paused and looked back over her shoulder. "Robert? I'm glad the popcorn's stale."

He watched her walk back to her friend, white dress swaying, and knew with absolute certainty that he'd just met the girl who would change everything. The movie played on, but Robert saw none of it. He was too busy counting the hours until Saturday, too busy feeling the world tilt and resettle into a new configuration, one where a girl named Silvia existed and had smiled at him like he mattered.

Above them, the Texas stars wheeled slowly across the summer sky, bearing witness to the beginning of something that would echo across decades.

# **Scene 2: Over the following weeks of summer 1981**

The parking lot behind Miller's Hardware Store became their sanctuary.

Robert's truck—a faded blue Chevy with rust spots blooming along the wheel wells—sat beneath the single working streetlight, its radio playing soft through the open windows. Silvia leaned against the tailgate, her sundress catching the warm breeze that carried the scent of honeysuckle and distant rain.

"Dance with me," Robert said, extending his hand.

She laughed, glancing around the empty lot. "Here? There's no music."

"Sure there is." He reached through the window and turned up the volume. A slow melody drifted out, something about holding on and never letting go. "See?"

Silvia placed her hand in his, and he pulled her close, one arm circling her waist while their joined hands pressed against his chest. They swayed in the amber glow of the streetlight, her head fitting perfectly beneath his chin.

"My father would die if he saw this," she whispered, but she was smiling.

"Then we won't let him see." Robert's breath stirred her hair. "Tell me something true, Silvia. Something you've never told anyone."

She was quiet for a moment, their feet shuffling against the cracked asphalt. "I want to be a teacher. Not just help in my mother's shop forever. I want to go to college, have my own classroom." She pulled back to look at him. "But my parents... they have different ideas."

"You'd be an amazing teacher." His voice held absolute certainty. "The kids would love you."

"What about you? What do you dream about?"

Robert's jaw tightened slightly. "Getting out of my old man's shadow. Making something of myself that's mine, not just following in his footsteps at the plant." He met her eyes. "Maybe architecture. Building things that last."

"Then do it." She reached up, touching his face. "Promise me you will."

"I promise." He caught her hand, pressed a kiss to her palm. "If you promise me something too."

"What?"

"That no matter what happens, you won't forget this. Us. Right here, right now."

The song changed to something more upbeat, but they kept swaying slow, creating their own rhythm. Silvia felt the steady beat of his heart beneath her cheek, memorized the way his arms felt around her—safe and certain and impossibly right.

---

Three nights later, they sat on the hood of his truck in Riverside Park, watching heat lightning flicker across the distant horizon. The cicadas sang their endless summer song, and the Trinity River murmured somewhere in the darkness beyond the trees.

Silvia traced constellations on Robert's forearm with her fingertip. "That's Cassiopeia. And there—that's the Summer Triangle."

"How do you know all this?"

"My abuela taught me. She used to say the stars remember everything. Every wish, every prayer, every promise." She looked up at the vast Texas sky, scattered with more stars than seemed possible. "She said if you really mean something, you should say it to the stars so they'll hold it for you."

Robert shifted to face her, his expression serious in the dim light. "Then I'm saying this to the stars." He took both her hands. "I love you, Silvia Martinez. I know we're young, I know it's only been a few weeks, but I've never been more sure of anything in my life."

Her breath caught. The words she'd been holding back for days tumbled free. "I love you too. So much it scares me."

He kissed her then, gentle and reverent, as if she were something precious that might break. When they parted, he pressed his forehead to hers.

"We're going to make it," he whispered. "Whatever comes, we'll figure it out together."

"Together," she echoed, and the stars witnessed their promise.

---

The last week of July brought a heat wave that baked the pavement and sent most sensible people indoors. But Robert and Silvia met anyway, at dawn before the worst of the heat, in the shade of the old live oak on Magnolia Street.

She brought pan dulce from her mother's bakery, still warm and dusted with sugar. He brought orange juice in a thermos and dreams spilling over with plans.

"We could go to Austin," Robert said, breaking off a piece of concha. "Both of us. You could go to UT, I could work construction, save up for school. Get a little apartment, nothing fancy, but it would be ours."

Silvia wanted to believe it could be that simple. But she knew her parents, knew the weight of tradition and expectation that rested on her shoulders as the eldest daughter. "Robert..."

"I know." He caught her worried expression. "I know it won't be easy. But look at me, Silvia." He waited until her dark eyes met his. "I'm not giving up on us. Not ever. I don't care if we have to wait, if we have to fight for it. You're worth fighting for."

She kissed him, tasting sugar and certainty, pouring everything she couldn't say into that single moment. When she pulled back, there were tears on her cheeks.

"Don't cry, baby."

"I'm not sad," she said, laughing through the tears. "I'm just... I never knew it could feel like this. Like my heart's too big for my chest."

Robert wiped her tears with his thumb, his touch infinitely gentle. "That's just love making room for itself."

They stayed under that oak tree until the heat drove them away, talking about everything and nothing, building castles in the air that felt solid as stone. Neither of them knew that summer was already slipping through their fingers like sand, that the future they were planning would never come to pass.

But in that moment, beneath the spreading branches with the morning light turning everything golden, they believed in forever with the absolute faith of the young and the deeply in love.

And the stars, as Silvia's abuela promised, remembered every word.

**Scene 3: Silvia's traditional parents d...**

**Scene 3: Silvia's traditional parents discover the relationship**

The front door slammed with such force that the Virgin Mary statue on the hallway table trembled. Silvia flinched in the kitchen, her hands frozen over the dishes she'd been washing.

"¡Silvia María Reyes!" Her father's voice thundered through the house. "Come here. Now."

Her mother appeared in the kitchen doorway, face pale and tight. "Go," she whispered. "Your father is waiting."

Silvia's heart hammered against her ribs as she dried her hands on a dish towel. She knew. Somehow, they knew. Mrs. Hernández from church must have seen them at the drive-in last weekend, or maybe it was Mr. Torres who'd spotted Robert's truck parked near the library where they'd met yesterday afternoon.

Her father stood in the living room, still in his work clothes, his face darker than she'd ever seen it. Her mother positioned herself by the window, arms crossed, avoiding Silvia's eyes.

"Is it true?" Her father's words were clipped, controlled—which was somehow worse than yelling. "You've been seeing a boy? Sneaking around behind our backs?"

"Papá, I—"

"Don't lie to me." He held up a hand. "María Hernández saw you. At the drive-in. With some Anglo boy's arm around you, dancing like—" He stopped, his jaw working. "You're sixteen years old, Silvia. Sixteen."

"I wasn't sneaking. I just—I didn't think—"

"No, you didn't think." Her mother finally spoke, her voice thick with disappointment. "You didn't think about your reputation, about this family's name, about your sisters watching everything you do."

From the hallway, Silvia could hear her younger siblings trying to be quiet, their whispers barely audible.

"Robert is a good person," Silvia said, hating how her voice shook. "If you would just meet him—"

"Robert." Her father said the name like it tasted bitter. "This boy who takes advantage of young girls—"

"He didn't take advantage of anyone! We just talked, and danced, and—"

"And what?" Her mother moved closer, eyes sharp. "What else, Silvia? What else have you done with this boy?"

Heat flooded Silvia's face. "Nothing! We haven't—we just—"

"You're too young to understand what you're doing," her father said. "Too young to be serious about any boy, especially one who isn't even from our community, who doesn't understand our traditions, our values."

"You don't even know him!"

"I know enough." Her father's voice rose now, the control slipping. "I know he's eighteen years old, an adult man pursuing my teenage daughter. I know you've been lying to us, disrespecting this family. That's enough."

Tears burned in Silvia's eyes. "It's not like that. We love each other—"

"Love?" Her mother laughed, but there was no humor in it. "Mija, you don't know what love is. You think this boy will marry you? Take care of you? His family will never accept you, and you've thrown away your reputation for what? For dancing and sweet words?"

"You're not seeing him again," her father said flatly. "I forbid it."

"Papá, please—"

"This discussion is over. You go to school, you come home, you help your mother. That's all. No more library visits alone. No more going out with friends unless we know exactly where you are and who you're with." He pointed toward the stairs. "Go to your room. Think about what you've done to this family."

Silvia stood frozen, tears streaming down her face. "You can't do this."

"We can, and we will." Her mother's face was stone. "We're your parents. We know what's best for you, even if you can't see it now."

---

The phone call came three days later, brief and whispered while her mother was hanging laundry in the backyard.

"Silvia?" Robert's voice cracked through the receiver. "I got your letter. Is it true? They won't let you see me at all?"

She pressed the phone tight against her ear, watching the kitchen doorway. "I'm so sorry. I tried to explain, but they won't listen. They think you're—they don't understand."

"I'll talk to them. I'll come over right now and explain—"

"No!" Panic seized her. "Robert, no. That'll make it worse. My father—he's so angry. If you come here—"

"Then what do we do?" The desperation in his voice matched the ache in her chest. "I can't just lose you like this."

Through the window, she saw her mother gathering the last of the sheets. "I have to go. I'll try to get to the library tomorrow after school. The one on Fifth Street. Four o'clock. Please, Robert—"

She hung up before he could answer, before her mother could walk in and see her face, read every forbidden feeling written there.

---

The library parking lot was nearly empty when Silvia arrived, having told her mother she needed books for a school project. Robert's truck sat under the oak tree at the far end, and her heart lurched at the sight of it.

He was waiting by the entrance, hands shoved in his pockets, his face lighting up when he saw her. But the joy faded quickly when he got close enough to see her swollen eyes, the exhaustion etched in every line of her body.

"Hey," he said softly, reaching for her hand.

She let him take it, just for a moment, memorizing the warmth of his palm against hers. Then she pulled away.

"We can't do this anymore."

The words hung between them like shattered glass.

Robert shook his head. "Don't say that. We'll figure something out. In two years, you'll be eighteen. We can wait—"

"Two years?" A bitter laugh escaped her. "Robert, they're moving us. My father found a job in El Paso. He says it's been planned for months, but I know—I know it's because of us. We're leaving in three weeks."

The color drained from his face. "El Paso? That's—that's across the whole state."

"I know." The tears came again, hot and helpless. "I tried everything. I begged them. I promised I'd never see you again if we could just stay, but they don't believe me. They think... they think I'm ruined now. That the only way to fix this is to start over somewhere new."

Robert's hands clenched into fists at his sides. "This isn't fair. We didn't do anything wrong."

"It doesn't matter what we did or didn't do. It only matters what they think, what people might say." She wiped at her eyes roughly. "My mother keeps talking about my reputation, about my sisters, about how I've brought shame to the family."

"You haven't—"

"I know that. You know that. But they don't see it that way." She looked up at him, trying to memorize every detail of his face—the way his hair fell across his forehead, the exact shade of his eyes, the curve of his mouth. "This is goodbye, Robert."

"No." He reached for her again, and this time she let him pull her close, breathing in the scent of him—soap and summer and everything she was losing. "It doesn't have to be. I'll write to you. You can write back. And when you turn eighteen—"

"And say what in the letters?" She pulled back enough to see his face. "That we're still waiting? Still hoping? Robert, my parents will read anything that comes to the house. And in two years, you'll be twenty. You'll be in college, or working, or—or you'll have met someone else—"

"I won't."

"You should." The words tore at her throat. "You should move on and find someone whose family doesn't think you're the devil himself. Someone you can actually be with."

"I don't want someone else." His voice broke. "Silvia, please. Don't give up on us."

She stood on her toes and kissed him, soft and desperate, tasting salt from both their tears. When she pulled away, she forced herself to step back, to put distance between them.

"I have to go. My mother thinks I'm just grabbing books."

"Silvia—"

"I'm sorry." She was backing away now, toward her sister's borrowed car. "I'm so sorry, Robert. For all of

**Scene 4: On Día de los Muertos 2022, si...**

**Scene 4: On Día de los Muertos 2022, sixty-year-old widowed Silvia visits the cemetery to honor her late husband's grave with traditional ofrendas**

The November sun hung low over the Texas cemetery, casting long shadows across the rows of headstones. Silvia Martinez adjusted the basket on her arm and made her way along the familiar path, her sensible flats crunching softly on the gravel. At sixty, she moved with the careful grace of someone who'd learned that bodies didn't forgive carelessness the way they once did.

Miguel's grave sat beneath the spreading branches of a live oak, just where the afternoon light would filter through in golden patches. She'd chosen this spot three years ago, standing in this exact position while the funeral director waited patiently, because Miguel had always loved sitting in dappled shade with his morning coffee.

Silvia knelt slowly, setting her basket down. The grass was still slightly damp from the morning dew.

"Hola, mi amor," she whispered, brushing a few fallen leaves from the polished granite. "I brought your favorites."

From the basket, she withdrew marigolds—cempasúchil—their orange petals bright as flames against the gray stone. She arranged them in the built-in vase, their pungent scent filling the air. The scent of memory, her abuela used to say. The scent that guides souls home.

Next came the candles, three votives in glass holders that she positioned carefully at the base of the headstone. She lit them one by one, the flames dancing in the gentle breeze. Then the food: pan de muerto wrapped in wax paper, still warm from her kitchen; a small thermos of champurrado; and Miguel's beloved chicharrones in a paper bag, the kind from the little market on Guadalupe Street that he'd driven across town for every Saturday.

She sat back on her heels, studying the headstone she knew by heart.

*Miguel Antonio Martinez*
*Beloved Husband, Father, Grandfather*
*1959-2019*
*"His love was steady as the stars"*

"The kids wanted to come later," she said, speaking as naturally as if Miguel sat beside her. "Rosa's bringing the grandchildren after school. Little Miguel—your namesake—he's playing soccer now. You'd be so proud. He has your determination."

A breeze stirred the marigold petals.

Silvia pulled her cardigan tighter around her shoulders. The afternoon was mild, but she felt cold these days in a way that had nothing to do with temperature. It was the cold of an empty house, of cooking for one, of no one to share the small observations that made up a life.

"Thirty-five years," she murmured, tracing the dates with her eyes. "We had thirty-five good years, didn't we? You gave me everything I needed. A home. Beautiful children. Stability. Kindness."

She paused, her throat tightening.

"You were a good man, Miguel. The best husband I could have asked for."

The words were true. All of them. And yet.

Silvia reached into her basket one more time, withdrawing a small photograph in a silver frame. It showed her and Miguel on their wedding day, both of them young and smiling, her in white lace, him in a crisp tuxedo. She placed it beside the candles.

In the photo, she was twenty-two. Her eyes were bright, her smile genuine. She'd loved Miguel—truly loved him. He'd courted her properly, won over her parents, given her the respectable life they'd wanted for her. She'd been happy.

But sometimes, in the quiet moments—folding laundry, washing dishes, lying awake in the dark—she'd catch herself wondering. Wondering about a different summer, a different boy, a different version of her life that had never been allowed to unfold.

"I'm sorry," she whispered, though she wasn't sure if she was apologizing to Miguel or to herself. "I tried not to think about it. I really did."

Forty-one years. Forty-one years since that last night at the drive-in, since her father had discovered them, since her world had been packed into boxes and moved three hundred miles away. She'd been sixteen, heartbroken, certain she would die from the pain of it.

But she hadn't died. She'd finished high school in a new town, gone to community college, met Miguel at her cousin's quinceañera. He'd been patient with her sadness, gentle with her guarded heart. And eventually, she'd let herself love him. Differently than she'd loved Robert—more quietly, more carefully—but love nonetheless.

Still. After all these years. After marriage and children and grandchildren and a lifetime of memories.

Still, sometimes she wondered.

What had become of Robert? Had he married? Had he been happy? Did he ever think of her on summer nights, or had she been just a brief chapter in his story, easily forgotten?

Silvia pressed her palm flat against the cool granite of Miguel's headstone.

"I loved you," she said firmly. "I did. I do. You have to know that."

The candle flames flickered, and in the distance, she heard the crunch of gravel as someone else entered the cemetery. She didn't turn to look. Día de los Muertos brought many visitors to honor their dead.

She stayed a moment longer, letting the afternoon settle around her—the scent of marigolds, the warmth of the candles, the weight of all the years behind her and the uncertain stretch of years ahead.

Finally, she rose, her knees protesting. She gathered her empty basket and pressed two fingers to her lips, then to Miguel's name.

"Te amo," she whispered. "Always."

As she turned to leave, movement caught her eye. A man, probably in his early sixties, stood several rows over, his head bowed before another grave. Something about his profile, the set of his shoulders, tugged at a memory she couldn't quite place.

Silvia shook her head. These days, everyone reminded her of someone. Grief and age played tricks on the mind.

She started down the path toward the parking lot, but found herself glancing back once more at the man. He'd lifted his head now, and even at this distance, even after all these years, something about him seemed achingly familiar.

Her heart gave an unexpected flutter.

No. It couldn't be.

Could it?

**Scene 5: While tending to her husband's...**

**Scene 5: While tending to her husband's grave**

The afternoon sun filtered through the ancient oak trees, casting dappled shadows across the rows of headstones. Silvia knelt beside Miguel's grave, her knees pressing into the soft grass as she arranged the last of the marigolds around the photograph she'd brought—Miguel in his favorite guayabera, smiling at a family barbecue three summers ago.

"There," she whispered, sitting back on her heels. "Perfect, mi amor."

The cemetery was quieter now. Most families had completed their Día de los Muertos visits earlier in the day, leaving behind a sea of orange and yellow blooms, flickering candles, and the lingering scent of copal incense mixing with autumn air.

She was reaching for her purse when footsteps crunched on the gravel path behind her.

"Silvia? Silvia Moreno?"

The voice was familiar in a way that made her breath catch. She turned, one hand still resting on Miguel's headstone, and found herself looking up at a man in his early sixties. Salt-and-pepper hair, kind eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses, a slight paunch that spoke of comfortable middle age. He wore jeans and a denim jacket, holding a small bouquet of carnations.

Recognition hit her like a wave.

"Frank?" She rose slowly, brushing grass from her knees. "Frank Callahan?"

"I thought that was you." His smile was warm but uncertain, as if he wasn't sure whether approaching her had been a mistake. "It's been... God, it's been—"

"Forty-two years," she said softly.

The number hung between them, heavy with everything unsaid.

Frank shifted his weight, glancing at Miguel's headstone with its fresh decorations. "I'm sorry for your loss. I heard about... I should have sent something."

"It's all right." Silvia wrapped her arms around herself, suddenly aware of how exposed she felt standing there. "Were you visiting...?"

"My parents. And my sister." He gestured vaguely toward the older section of the cemetery. "Mom passed two years ago. Dad's been gone since '95."

"I'm sorry."

They stood in awkward silence, two people separated by decades and choices neither of them had fully controlled. A breeze rustled through the oak leaves, sending a few marigold petals skittering across the grass.

"You look well," Frank said finally. "Different, but... well."

Silvia laughed, a sound caught between humor and sorrow. "We're all different now, aren't we? Older. Grayer." She touched her silver-streaked hair self-consciously.

"Some things don't change, though." Frank's expression softened. "You still have the same eyes. Robert used to say—" He stopped abruptly, color rising in his weathered cheeks. "Sorry. That was... I shouldn't have..."

"No." The word came out sharper than she intended. Silvia pressed her fingers to her lips, then lowered them slowly. "No, it's... How is he? Robert?"

Frank's hesitation told her volumes. He looked down at the carnations in his hands, then back at her face. "He's... he's doing all right. Recently widowed himself, actually. Linda passed in June."

"Oh." Silvia felt an unexpected pang of sympathy, followed immediately by a flutter of something she had no right to feel. "I'm so sorry. Were they...?"

"Thirty-eight years married. Three kids, five grandchildren." Frank's voice held a note of protective pride. "She was good to him. Good for him."

*As Miguel was good to me*, Silvia thought. *As I tried to be good for Miguel.*

The silence stretched again, but this time it felt less awkward, more contemplative. Somewhere in the distance, a mockingbird sang, running through its repertoire of borrowed melodies.

Silvia knew she should say goodbye. Should let this moment pass, let the past remain buried like the loved ones resting beneath these stones. But something—the soft light, the sacred day, the weight of forty-two years of wondering—loosened her tongue.

"Frank?" Her voice came out barely above a whisper. "Does he... did he ever...?" She couldn't finish the question, couldn't even fully articulate it to herself.

But Frank seemed to understand. His eyes grew distant, thoughtful. "He named his daughter Sylvie," he said quietly. "Spelled different, but... Linda never knew why he was so insistent on that name."

Silvia's hand flew to her chest, where her heart hammered against her ribs. She felt tears prick at her eyes and blinked them back fiercely.

"I never stopped wondering," she heard herself say. The confession tumbled out before she could stop it, raw and honest. "About him. About what might have been if my parents hadn't..." She shook her head. "I loved my husband. Miguel was a good man, and I don't regret our life together. But I never stopped wondering."

Frank studied her for a long moment, his expression unreadable. Then, slowly, he nodded. "Would you... would you want me to tell him? That I saw you?"

Every rational part of Silvia screamed at her to say no. To let sleeping dogs lie, to honor Miguel's memory by keeping the door to the past firmly closed. She had built a good life. Raised three beautiful children. Had grandchildren of her own now. What good could possibly come from stirring up ghosts?

But standing there in the golden afternoon light, surrounded by marigolds and memories, she found herself nodding.

"Yes," she whispered. "Tell him... tell him I said hello. And that I hope he's well."

"I will." Frank reached out and squeezed her shoulder gently, a gesture of understanding that transcended the decades between that summer of '81 and this autumn afternoon. "Take care of yourself, Silvia."

"You too, Frank."

She watched him walk away, his figure growing smaller as he headed toward the older section of the cemetery. When he disappeared behind a row of monuments, she turned back to Miguel's grave and sank down beside it once more.

"I'm sorry, mi amor," she whispered, touching the photograph. "I hope you understand."

The wind picked up, making the candle flames dance, and Silvia could have sworn she felt Miguel's presence there beside her—not angry, not hurt, but understanding in the way he'd always understood her, even the parts of herself she'd never fully explained.

She stayed until the sun began to set, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink that reminded her of drive-in movie screens and a boy who'd once held her like she was made of starlight.

Then she gathered her things and headed home, not knowing that miles across town, Frank was pulling into his brother's driveway, rehearsing what he would say to a man who'd spent forty-two years trying to forget a girl he'd never stopped loving.

**Scene 6: Frank visits his recently wido...**

**Scene 6: Frank visits his recently widowed brother Robert at his home**

The November sun was already sinking toward the horizon when Frank pulled into Robert's driveway. The ranch-style house looked the same as always—neat lawn, trimmed hedges, the porch swing where Robert and Margaret used to sit on summer evenings. But something felt different now. Emptier. The house had been a home for forty years, and now it was just a building where his brother existed.

Frank knocked twice before using his key. "Rob? It's me."

"In here."

He found Robert in the den, surrounded by cardboard boxes and photo albums. The room smelled of old paper and dust. Robert sat in his leather recliner—the one Margaret had always complained was too worn to keep—wearing jeans and an old UT Austin sweatshirt. His salt-and-pepper hair needed a trim, and the lines around his eyes seemed deeper than they'd been even a month ago.

"Sorting through things?" Frank asked, settling onto the couch.

"Margaret's sister wants some photos. Family albums, mostly." Robert closed the book in his lap without looking up. "Thought I'd get a head start before Thanksgiving. You know how Linda gets."

"That I do." Frank accepted the beer Robert gestured toward on the side table. They sat in comfortable silence for a moment, the kind only brothers who'd known each other for six decades could share.

Frank took a long drink, gathering his nerve. "I ran into someone yesterday. At the cemetery."

"Yeah?" Robert's attention stayed on the album, his thumb tracing the edge of a photograph.

"Silvia Ramírez."

Robert's hand stilled. The silence that followed felt thick enough to touch.

"Silvia Garcia now," Frank continued, watching his brother carefully. "Was, anyway. She's widowed too. Lost her husband last year."

Robert finally looked up. His face had gone carefully blank, the expression he'd worn in boardrooms for thirty years when he didn't want anyone reading him. But Frank knew better. He could see the tension in his brother's jaw, the way his fingers pressed white against the album cover.

"How is she?" Robert's voice came out rougher than intended. He cleared his throat.

"She looked good. Older, obviously. We all are." Frank leaned forward, elbows on his knees. "She was visiting her husband's grave. We talked for a bit."

Robert set the album aside with deliberate care, as if it might shatter. "That's... that's good. That you were there. I'm sure she appreciated the company."

"She asked about you."

The words hung in the air between them. Robert's hand moved to the armrest, gripping it.

"She said..." Frank paused, knowing he was about to detonate something that had been buried for forty-one years. "She said she never stopped wondering about you. All these years, Rob. She never forgot."

Robert stood abruptly, walked to the window overlooking the backyard. The live oak he and Margaret had planted when they bought the house now towered over the fence, its branches reaching toward the darkening sky. He stood there, back rigid, one hand braced against the window frame.

"Rob?"

"I need you to not—" Robert's voice cracked. He stopped, pressed his forehead against the cool glass. "Christ, Frank."

Frank waited. Outside, a neighbor's dog barked. A car drove past. The ordinary sounds of life continuing while his brother's carefully constructed world shifted on its axis.

"I was eighteen years old," Robert finally said, so quietly Frank almost didn't hear him. "Eighteen years old, and I knew. I knew she was it. The one. And then she was just... gone."

"I know."

"Do you?" Robert turned, and Frank was startled to see tears tracking down his brother's face. "I loved Margaret. God, I loved her so much, and I gave her everything I had. Forty good years. I don't want you thinking—"

"I'm not thinking anything except that you're human, Rob. You were allowed to love more than one person in your life."

Robert sank back into his chair, rubbing his face with both hands. When he looked up, his eyes were red but dry. "I used to drive by her parents' old house sometimes. Years ago, before they moved. Just to see if... I don't know what I thought I'd see. Her car, maybe. Some sign she'd come back to visit."

"Did she know? How you felt?"

"I told her I loved her the night before her father found out about us. We were at the drive-in, sitting on the hood of my truck, and she had her head on my shoulder. The stars were so bright that night." Robert's voice grew distant with memory. "I told her I was going to marry her someday. That we'd have a house with a big yard and kids and a dog. The whole American dream."

"What did she say?"

A ghost of a smile crossed Robert's face. "She said she wanted two dogs. And that she'd marry me tomorrow if I asked."

Frank felt the weight of all those lost years pressing down on the room. "She's here, Rob. In Austin. Living over near Zilker Park."

Robert's head snapped up. "How do you—"

"I asked. And she told me." Frank pulled out his phone, pulled up a note. "I got her number."

"Frank—"

"I'm not saying you have to call. I'm not saying anything except that she's out there, and she's thinking about you, and maybe—just maybe—it's not too late for something. I don't know what. But something."

Robert stared at the phone Frank held out like it was a live grenade. "Margaret's only been gone eight months."

"I know."

"People would talk."

"Let them."

"I'm sixty-two years old, Frank. I'm not some kid anymore. I can't just—"

"Can't what? Feel something? Want something?" Frank set the phone on the side table between them. "I watched you be the perfect husband for forty years. The perfect father. The perfect businessman. But I remember that summer, Rob. I remember how you looked at her. Like she was the sun and you were finally warm for the first time in your life."

Robert's hand moved toward the phone, then pulled back. "What if she's different? What if I'm different? What if whatever we had was just... kid stuff? Summer romance that wouldn't have lasted anyway?"

"Then you'll know. And you can both finally stop wondering." Frank stood, clapped his brother on the shoulder. "I'm not saying call her tonight. Just... think about it."

He made it to the door before Robert spoke again.

"Frank?"

"Yeah?"

"Does she still..." Robert trailed off, shook his head. "Never mind."

"She still has kind eyes," Frank said softly. "And when she talked about you, she got this look. Like she was eighteen again, just for a second. Like the years fell away."

After Frank left, Robert sat in the gathering darkness, not bothering to turn on the lights. The phone lay on the table beside him, glowing faintly. Outside, the November wind rustled through the live oak's branches, whispering secrets only the night could hear.

He picked up the phone. Put it down. Picked it up again.

On the screen, a name: Silvia Garcia.

And beneath it, a number that might lead back to a summer night in 1981, to a girl with dark eyes and dreams of forever, to a version of himself he thought he'd buried along with all the other might-have-beens.

Robert's finger hovered over the call button.

Not tonight. Not yet.

But maybe. Maybe soon.

He saved the contact and set the phone aside, his heart beating faster than it had in forty-one years.
